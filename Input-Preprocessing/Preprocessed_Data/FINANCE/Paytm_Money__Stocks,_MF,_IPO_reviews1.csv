"Paytm Money: Stocks, MF, IPO",Unknown,5,It's been 3 years I am using this app. I must say it's a very good app for the traders. Specially there option chain with green and red colour combination. It's really helpful for me. But if you bring some more updates in it then traders like me will be very grateful. For example you ar showin open interest analysis and change in open interest of each strike price very well. With this you can add all the change in open interest and show the data combination of red and green colour.
