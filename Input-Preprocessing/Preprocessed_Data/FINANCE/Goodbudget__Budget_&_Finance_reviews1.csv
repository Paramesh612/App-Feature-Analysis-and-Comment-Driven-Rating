the Dave Ramsey envelope method without actually having to use cash, which 
just isn't practical for me. I like that I have to manually move the 
monetary amounts rather than it happening automatically (although you can 
schedule transactions if you prefer). It helps me stay accountable and feel 
every purchase just like if I was using cash. The only problem I have had 
with the app is when I tried to use the option for getting paid every other 
week. It was budgeting more money for me to spend than I was actually 
making. To counter that, I now just list that paycheck as twice a month. If 
there happens to be a third pay period in a month I just add that one 
manually. It's worked like a charm ever since I figured out that one little

This app allows you to build a biweekly budget which is something most of the big name apps did not do well. You can upload your bank/credit card statements and categorize everything all at once or log transactions as you make them.  I tried using the big name apps that monitor your accounts and try to categorize transactions for you, but those always made mistakes, and the delay between when I played for something and when it showed up on the app made it seem like the numbers never truly represented how much I had left. Not to mention the security risk of giving them my bank log-in info.  This app may require a small amount of effort in that you have to log transactions yourself, but once you set up the envelopes correctly this becomes effortless. Anytime you reach for your wallet you log it on your phone. This small amount of effort gives you a perfect picture of your financial situation.  We use this app to keep track of our long term savings like Christmas and annual fees, but we also use it for our 2 week budget because we get paid every 2 weeks. Some envelopes get filled to the top and others get a set amount each payday.

Goodbudget: Budget & Finance,Unknown,5,"I have tried so many other budget apps and spreadsheets, and this is hands down my favorite by FAR! I am a very detailed oriented person, and I budget down to the penny. This budget allows me to see all of my decisions and how they impact the rest of my budget. I used the free version for 7 years or so. But, I finally made the leap to the paid subscription, and I don't think I'll ever look back. It has been worth the money to me. The free version only gave me so many envelopes before I had to buy a subscription (which is honestly very generous of them and I'm so thankful for their free app while in college and starting out in life). But, I still had to use an excel spreadsheet to keep track of things since I had to combine budgets together in one envelope. Now in the paid version I can have as many envelopes as my heart desires. I can have ""goals"" that I work up to and not just a monthly bill I budget for. Do I need a new dishwasher, I'll create an envelope for it as a goal and when I have the money in there, I know I can afford it guilt free. I cannot recommend this app enough.

Since it's free it's definitely a good start for serious budgeting.   There are some things I think would be even better. For one, being able to change the start of the month (to the 23rd, when paychecks arrive?). Another is a way to treat savings and investments. I think savings should be a default, and there should be a way to distinguish this from other forms of expenditure. This also means being able to move ""leftovers"" from the other envelopes into a savings envelope.   Manually doing it is fine, so thank you so much for the capacity to do this in the first place!

Goodbudget: Budget & Finance,Unknown,5,"Been using it for about a month, best to start a month ahead if you can. You divide up your monthly or weekly income into envelopes and you spend money on things out of the envelopes and try not to go over. The idea is you are supposed to see how much you have left and try to keep it in the envelope. Whatever is leftover rolls over to the next month. One thing I'd like to see is an auto savings. Instead of rolling over have the option to move the leftovers to savings on a set day and for unallocated too.",been using it for about a month best to start a month ahead if you can you divide up your monthly or weekly income into envelopes and you spend money on things out of the envelopes and try not to go over the idea is you are supposed to see how much you have left and try to keep it in the envelope whatever is leftover rolls over to the next month one thing id like to see is an auto savings instead of rolling over have the option to move the leftovers to savings on a set day and for unallocated too

I don't mind paying for an app but $5 a month is too much for what it does.  Many would complain about paying that much for their checking account.

Goodbudget: Budget & Finance,Unknown,4,I love the separate envelopes I just wish there was a way to have two separate budgets for the month on the same account as we have a bill check and a rent check. we get paid twice a month but each check has a different budget. And some of the items are split between checks so if I did one envelope for the month at $50 bu $30 was to come out of the first paycheck and $20 out of the second I would need to go back to our paper budget every time to remember how much out of which check when filling the envelope,i love the separate envelopes i just wish there was a way to have two separate budgets for the month on the same account as we have a bill check and a rent check we get paid twice a month but each check has a different budget and some of the items are split between checks so if i did one envelope for the month at bu was to come out of the first paycheck and out of the second i would need to go back to our paper budget every time to remember how much out of which check when filling the envelope

Now we do weekly reconciliations of what is in our hand and what is in the bank and savings to the penny. It feels so good to tally to the last penny.

The customer support for EEBA is by far the best I have received for any software that I can think of.  Support is limited to a support forum, but the devs respond quickly and with helpful suggestions.  If they can't help with your specific issue, they look into ways to fix the app around your problem.  Give EEBA some time, and you'll end up wondering how you did without.
