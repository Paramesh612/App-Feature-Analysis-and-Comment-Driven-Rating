Monefy - Budget & Expenses app,Unknown,1,"The app is attractive and has some nice features but it suffers from some serious issues. As a budget manager, it fails completely because there is no way to add income to your budget during the month. As an example, say you purchase a shirt and you subtract the cost from your clothing category. Then you decide to return the shirt for a refund. When you try to add those funds back into your clothing budget it doesn't work. The app lets you log the addition and at first glance you might think that it worked properly, but if you check you'll find that your funds remaining for the month does not increase despite the addition. Your remaining funds balance is now incorrect. Every budget app needs to be able to handle funds going both IN and OUT. This one only handles funds going out. The developer seemed disinterested in fixing this issue when contacted. There are other issues as well but this is such a basic budgeting function that if the app doesn't do this properly, it's time to look elsewhere. UPDATE 2021: This developer is now completely unresponsive so be aware that if you have an issue you will be on your own.",the app is attractive and has some nice features but it suffers from some serious issues as a budget manager it fails completely because there is no way to add income to your budget during the month as an example say you purchase a shirt and you subtract the cost from your clothing category then you decide to return the shirt for a refund when you try to add those funds back into your clothing budget it doesnt work the app lets you log the addition and at first glance you might think that it worked properly but if you check youll find that your funds remaining for the month does not increase despite the addition your remaining funds balance is now incorrect every budget app needs to be able to handle funds going both in and out this one only handles funds going out the developer seemed disinterested in fixing this issue when contacted there are other issues as well but this is such a basic budgeting function that if the app doesnt do this properly its time to look elsewhere update this developer is now completely unresponsive so be aware that if you have an issue you will be on your own

Monefy - Budget & Expenses app,Unknown,1,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP! I know it's only ¬£2 but it adds up. Downloaded it and liked what I saw so I immediately bought it - the type of impulsivity that proves just how much I need budgeting software such as this. However, after about 5 more minutes fiddling around with the app I then found there's a glitch! After you use the calculator (if adding up expenses, for example), it just makes everything go to hell - you can't add income or expenses, rendering the app completely useless. I tried clearing the app's cache, restarting my phone, and all sorts, but nothing worked. I then sent the app's help centre a message to see if they could help me fix the problem and if not, give me a refund. They didn't respond, and the time spent waiting for a response is probably the reason that my request for a refund through Google Play didn't work. So don't buy this app. I don't like writing negative reviews but the makers of this app shouldn't be making money from an app that has such a fundamental flaw. I understand that this could potentially just be an issue with its compatibility with my phone, but the fact that they didn't respond to my message alone speaks volumes. If they don't respond to my polite request for help, they're not gonna respond to you, either, should any issues arise.",do not pay for this app i know its only but it adds up downloaded it and liked what i saw so i immediately bought it the type of impulsivity that proves just how much i need budgeting software such as this however after about more minutes fiddling around with the app i then found theres a glitch after you use the calculator if adding up expenses for example it just makes everything go to hell you cant add income or expenses rendering the app completely useless i tried clearing the apps cache restarting my phone and all sorts but nothing worked i then sent the apps help centre a message to see if they could help me fix the problem and if not give me a refund they didnt respond and the time spent waiting for a response is probably the reason that my request for a refund through google play didnt work so dont buy this app i dont like writing negative reviews but the makers of this app shouldnt be making money from an app that has such a fundamental flaw i understand that this could potentially just be an issue with its compatibility with my phone but the fact that they didnt respond to my message alone speaks volumes if they dont respond to my polite request for help theyre not gonna respond to you either should any issues arise

I remember previously we can add new catagories and there were plenty of icons to choose from. Now all of that is gone. Instead whats given to us are total 15 catagories in which half of them are totally useless. For every thing else they forced us to pay them. GREEDY DEVELOPERS !!!. Highly disopinted. Uninstalling right away :(,i used this app before and i loved it thats why i installed it again but to my disappointment it has changed a lot i remember previously we can add new catagories and there were plenty of icons to choose from now all of that is gone instead whats given to us are total catagories in which half of them are totally useless for every thing else they forced us to pay them greedy developers highly disopinted uninstalling right away

I would like to request the addition of a fortnightly view rather than just Day/Week/Month/Year. My pay, rent, and most of my other bills are all expenses/income that occur fortnightly, and it makes every second week look weirdly lucrative or weirdly expensive when it's not able to be lumped together.   I also wouldn't mind being able to generate a graph of expenditure over X weeks/fortnights/months to easily compare which had been more expensive.

It's a really simple and effective budgeting tool that let's me track travel expenses quickly and easily, but it has some serious flaws. Synchronisation between devices is finnicky and should be a lot quicker and easier. There's also a big problem with how currency conversion is handled: the exchange rate has to be entered manually and for absolutely no good reason it will only accept rates up to to 3 decimal places. This means if you're converting to a currency with a low value you can only put in a rough exchange rate (or none at all, if there are more than 10,000 of that currency to the base currency), meaning spending in that currency won't be accurately converted by the app.",great in a lot of ways its a really simple and effective budgeting tool that lets me track travel expenses quickly and easily but it has some serious flaws synchronisation between devices is finnicky and should be a lot quicker and easier theres also a big problem with how currency conversion is handled the exchange rate has to be entered manually and for absolutely no good reason it will only accept rates up to to decimal places this means if youre converting to a currency with a low value you can only put in a rough exchange rate or none at all if there are more than of that currency to the base currency meaning spending in that currency wont be accurately converted by the app

Monefy - Budget & Expenses app,Unknown,5,"Clean, minimal design. It feels intuitive to me. I was just using a list, almost lost my mind to monotony. Might sound childish, but the soft colors makes it feel quiet but lively. Also, only been a week and a half and my urges to shoot my self in the financial foot have been halted. Feel like I won't be borrowing and cash this month. Here's a hint for people who have spend-itis. Make a new catagorey ""Upcoming expenses"". Go ahead and enter whatever you'll be needing to spend money on between now and the next paycheck. Bills, gas, groceries. Deduct how much you want to put into savings (common idea is 10% of your income). Now you know how much you have left over to use however, with much less concern. You only get old if you stress. Now go experience something, you won't regret it. Have a good day. Thank you very much, to the creators of this app. It is simple and perfect for my crazies. :)",clean minimal design it feels intuitive to me i was just using a list almost lost my mind to monotony might sound childish but the soft colors makes it feel quiet but lively also only been a week and a half and my urges to shoot my self in the financial foot have been halted feel like i wont be borrowing and cash this month heres a hint for people who have spenditis make a new catagorey upcoming expenses go ahead and enter whatever youll be needing to spend money on between now and the next paycheck bills gas groceries deduct how much you want to put into savings common idea is of your income now you know how much you have left over to use however with much less concern you only get old if you stress now go experience something you wont regret it have a good day thank you very much to the creators of this app it is simple and perfect for my crazies

Good features, however the omissions are simple things (like being able to sort the list of expenses, which currently only sorts itself automatically on the basis of the $ amount)...   Impressively simple User Interface but the faded green colour background with the grey colour text and again, the faded green buttons are a horrible combination (as in, barely visible)... plus, make it a livelier greens, have contrast between different elements! Surely that's not very difficult.  Lack of information on what you get with the Pro version (seems like you have to pay per device, which isn't mentioned anywhere... All the promotion shows is 'Sync with other devices')... and their website is basically nothing. I've contacted their support team, let's see how that goes.  Also, the functionality isn't all there (intuitive button locations not adhered to, need to use the in-app number keypad to enter $ amounts instead of the phone's numerical keyboard being triggered, inconsistent implementation of the 'Back &lt;-'  button... saves the transaction when editing an expense, discards it when adding a new expense)!  But for someone with simple needs, I'd recommend this. I tried 7-8 apps, and while they have a ton more features, they're complex to the point of just using your Online Banking app instead. This is a good alternative.
