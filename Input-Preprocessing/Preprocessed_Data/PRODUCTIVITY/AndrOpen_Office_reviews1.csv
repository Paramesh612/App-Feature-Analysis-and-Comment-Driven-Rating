AndrOpen Office,Unknown,3,This office app is by far the most feature rich office in play store with more supported file types. I will give props for that.

Horizontal scroll in calc is often unresponsive and not very smooth. The UI is very old.

AndrOpen Office,Unknown,1,This app is visually beautiful And i really want to like it for my Samsung Tablet but it doesn't work in the most fundamental ways. You cannot select text and apply any formatting. You can set italics but only one word at a time. Any editing is impossible. Most of the features of Open Office are there but they simply don't work.

Google Docs are nice, but a compromise with formatting too limited and some features (such as graphs) just missing on the tablet. Again, a plus for AndrOpen Office.  Two things I noticed immediately. No Dropbox support. I'd like to have that because, ironically, Google drive doesn't integrate into the Linux desktop while Dropbox does, so Dropbox has become the exchange/sharing platform for my family. Second, the Google Drive integration is only partial. The Open dialog let me select Google Drive, but the Save As (and Save for a new document) don't.

AndrOpen Office,Unknown,5,It's a desktop like office app. Highly recommended especially for those who don't have PCs or laptops but have tablets or smart phones because of its rich features allows you to do what you could have done in PC or laptop. The only downside is probably its incompatibility with some devices especially those not coming from the worldwide known brands but it is still possible because i for myself was able to get it to work on my locally branded smartphone.
