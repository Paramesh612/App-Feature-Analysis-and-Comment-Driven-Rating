"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,4,"I use the app to replace blackboard while giving math lectures at a university (over Zoom). I typically create partially filled pdf slides and then write on them while lecturing, using a 10.5 inch android tablet with pen. Three things would vastly improve the app for me: 1) while the pen is hovering over the screen, there is a tiny circle. However, it's so small that the student's can barely see it. I don't know if this is something that can be done inside the app, but I would love if I could change the way this circle looks and use it as a pointer. 2) The blue bar on top takes up about 20% of the screen while not containing anything too useful. The app looks like it thinks that my screen is much smaller than it actually is. The bar doesn't go away when my tablet is connected over Zoom and I am sharing its screen. 3) I change colors often. I like the preselected colors and appreciate that it takes only 3 taps to change color (unlike other apps), but I would appreciate if the (much thinner version of) the blue bar on top had a few color disks to choose from (of colors customizable by the user) and color change would take one tap, not 3. 4) The last complaint is just a minor one, but maybe easily fixable: when I write on my slides (created with beamer, LaTeX, of standard size) and I want to add a page, I struggle to find the correct size to match the other pages. As a result, the resulting class notes have pages that are suddenly twice as big, or the pen becomes too thin, etc...

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,4,"I have been using NoteShelf since Aug 2020. I use note writing apps a lot for studying AI and stats (a lot of equations, diagrams and images) so it is an absolute critical piece of software, besides having decent hardware (Tab S7). After all these months, I finally decided to make the jump over to Squid. Bought the in-app tool pack, backup and PDF import.The overall experience have been great thus far. #################################### PLUS:: [ Palm rejection is MUCH MUCH better on Squid than on NoteShelf. I think it might be due to Squid requiring 2 fingers for pan. This was a MAJOR PITA for me using NoteShelf. ] - [ My backup EMR pen from my Likebook Muses worked way better than on NoteShelf. Even the eraser works on Squid, which doesn't work on NoteShelf. ] - [ I screenshot a lot (off lecture videos) for my notes. On Noteshelf, my palm kept accidentally selecting my screenshot-images because the app registered it as a long press. On Squid, selection of images requires the use of the lasso tool, so no such problem. ] - [ Pressure sensitivity works well. Makes my handwriting look a lot better. ] - [ Squid's shape tool is a lot more use-able compared to Noteshelf. I can be very precise. ] - [ I exported my NoteShelf notes as PDFs. Squid opened them up like a charm. ] - [ If we put font choice aside, typing text with a bluetooth keyboard is a lot less buggy on Squid vis-a-vis NoteShelf. ] - [ 1000% zoom. I can pack a lot into an A4 sheet. Especially useful when writing cheat-sheets. ] - [ There is backup to a local folder. This plays well for me as I have FolderSync Pro. No such feature on NoteShelf. ] - [ I can set what action to take when I press my S-pen button. No such setting on NoteShelf. ] ####################### CONS:: [ Eraser size needs improving. The smallest setting (1mm) is still too big when you zoom in to 600%-1000%. Only way to work around is to not write at such high zoom levels. ] - [ Eraser shape is square. NoteShelf is circle, a shape that is a lot easier to get into the little nooks and crannies, especially on a page pack full of notes ] - [ One extra tap to switch out to other tools (i.e. lasso, highlight or shape tool.) ] - [ Lasso selection can be a bit tricky if handwriting and image are too close. Noteshelf doesn't have this issue: I usually just draw a small lasso circle in the middle of the image to avoid all the handwrite all around. ] - [ Not sure if the automated backup is actually working *Testing in progress ] - [ Cloud backup ONLY has Dropbox and Box. No Google Drive. NoteShelf has Drive, Evernote and Dropbox. ] - [ Whenever you zoom, the zoom % box (that lets you know what percentage zoom you're at and to lock it if you wish) is right smack in the center-top. Very irritating when you're trying to write from top-down. With NoteShelf, I was at least able to drag it into the corner. This box should really default to a corner. ] - [ No audio record. Noteshelf has it. ] - [ Access to other page templates requires a monthly subscription on Squid. Noteshelf's page templates are free. With PDF import, this is easy to go around on Squid: I just export as PDF from NoteShelf's template and use it as and when when on Squid. ] - [ No bookmarking.

In order to make straight lines or perfect shapes, you have to entirely select a different tool, then switch back to the regular pen. And even then you can only choose between two shapes and straight lines.

I wish there was a quick and easy way to turn on palm rejection.  I also wish there were more pen types like in INKredible.   The other big missing feature is the ability to back up to Google Drive as a cloud option.

However, both my phone and Chromebook automatically backup my notes to Dropbox every day as PDF's, and it's easy to export the really important notes to specific folders in my Google Drive (and other online platforms) as needed. Plus you can't beat the control for line thickness, color, and page background. Granted, you get even better backgrounds (including daily planner) if you sign up for premium, and I can't afford that. But with a few in-app purchases you can get PDF and JPG import, which will them provide any background you could possibly want. I actually use the app to take photos and then draw sketches over the photos. Once the sketch is done, I copy the lines over to a plain white background, and voila - a nice cartoon image.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,2,"I thought this was a good program with smooth writing, so I bought it to be able to import pdf's and write on them. I paid the $10 for a yearly subscription.   Yes, it allows you to write on the pdf's, but the refresh is horrible, I imported a 10 page pdf, and the tablet slowly redraws each page when I move between them. Should not have half the screen disappear. No, it's not the tablet. I use One Note by Microsoft, and I have none of these issues. Honestly not worth it.   I would recommend One Note, which is free and writes smoothly (plus you have access to all your notes on the web for free), or Xodo, which lets you highlight pdf's (I imported a 2000 page document, no issues scrolling entire document), also can add text, draw, and more. Going back to that, should have never left. Figured a paid app would be better than a free one, I was wrong. Really would like a refund.",i thought this was a good program with smooth writing so i bought it to be able to import pdfs and write on them i paid the for a yearly subscription yes it allows you to write on the pdfs but the refresh is horrible i imported a page pdf and the tablet slowly redraws each page when i move between them should not have half the screen disappear no its not the tablet i use one note by microsoft and i have none of these issues honestly not worth it i would recommend one note which is free and writes smoothly plus you have access to all your notes on the web for free or xodo which lets you highlight pdfs i imported a page document no issues scrolling entire document also can add text draw and more going back to that should have never left figured a paid app would be better than a free one i was wrong really would like a refund

On one note you can select in any with weird shake you want. This makes it easier to omit things that would normally be in the square. Add that as an additional feature, just like the eraser. I love what you did with it. On one note, you only had the stroke erase. Which make 0 made it hard to erase little bits. I would love to be able to square select and free select. Both are useful 2nd. Additional folders. One note didn't have this and to my knowledge this doesn't really either. Just like one sub folder I think. 3rd. PDF export view.

I will mention, since sometimes the devs read these, that I find the UI to be a bit clunky at times. For instance, I am often transfering between different modes (pencil, highlight, etc) and each transfer takes two button presses followed by a menu-clearing action. I really feel like this should be doable in a single action. Additionally, I am often times switching between different colors/thicknesses or have things that I am copying and pasting regularly. Two very useful features would be (a) color/line-thickness presets for both shapes and writing, and (b) a 'palette' where figures I have drawn can be saved for later use. A walk through of (b) would be: i. I draw a figure and decide to save it for later ii. I highlight the figure and touch button 'add-to-palette', adding the highlighted figure. iii. Later, I want to reuse my figure. I select the palette icon which presents a dropdown of thumbnail icons of each figure. iv.

It would be nice to actively save your drawings on drive and work on them from another device. There is some sort of global backup system via drive but that cannot be used to share files.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,"I recently got a Samsung Chromebook Pro for school, and I absolutely LOVE taking notes with this app.  I can have separate notebooks for all my different classes, I can use their infinite pages to fit an entire lecture's notes on a single page, making it really easy to find the notes from a specific day.  I'm pretty sure my classmates are all really grateful that I can easily turn my notes into a pdf that I can email to them too.  Lots of customization in how the pen works (I've found that 0.3 without pressure sensitivity works best for me).  I love the zoom feature.  It's really nice when you want to write small notes about something but you don't want to take up a whole line. I paid the few extra bucks for the ""premium"" upgrade, which if I remember correctly included the highlighter option, which is quite nice as well.  The premium package also has a bunch of other page templates like graph paper and stuff which I'll probably never use, but I'm sure would be super handy for someone else.  Honestly, I think my only complaints is that the highlighter doesn't look right... but that could just be that I haven't played around with the settings enough.  I've also had a couple crashes, but I've never lost anything and it's pretty rare and doesn't even take long to restart the app. I definitely recommend this app if you have a tablet with a stylus.  EDIT:  I can't believe I forgot to mention my absolute favorite feature!  THE UNDO BUTTON! I use it so often that I've actually found myself reaching for it when I make a mistake on actual paper!  The eraser is really nice too because it can get rid of an entire penstroke at once (though you can swap so that it only erases what you want too).

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,"As far as operational smoothness goes, it is phenomenal. I give it 5 stars cuz it's truly done well. Im grateful for the effort put into it. The zoom u can do and the ease of use is awesome. HOWEVER, developers, it's been a very long time already since u first came out, it's time u add these feature already: Please, augment the pen selection - now there is only 1 pen style. Most every other similar app has that. The color match feature is so critical that you're missing. The writing needs to be smoother as well. Right now it is very choppy, perhaps because it is vector based. Also, subfolder/directory ability, to be able to organize better.   02/14/18  Update I think it's time you integrate these critical things I've asked for for months. We're paying for this app you know, and I can't remember when you had the last meaningful upgraded.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,4,"I paid for this app. Its working beautiful with my Samsung TAB S3.  Features i like most in this app are: 1.

Fix zoom with adjustable ratio. (most helpful)  After using this app, i think these features make its even more better: 1. Color fill tool within closed boundaries. 2. More shapes like. ( hexagon, Pentagon, all direction arrow) 3. Table feature with column and row. 4. Add video file with supportive extension. (it can make notes more alive)  Finding some bugs like: 1. When i do zoom in, i could not write on exact location, mean that if i try to write after zoom in, stroke is delievered at different place.  2. Every time zoom in and out working with slight delay which is annoying.  Overall experience is best.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,"This is quite possibly the best ""note-taking"" app I've ever used.. but it's so much more than that.   It's a very powerful vector drawing tool, with an extremely simple but powerful interface.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,"Best note taking app that supports the active pen. Premium purchases are worth it. Much easier to use then LectureNotes, but not as customizable. There is no latency in regards to pen input. The pen chooser is quick and intuitive, but there is room for improvement. I purchased all the premium features and among them my favorites are the highlighter and PDF import. Premium paper patterns are only available as a subscription service. The cloud backup (also premium) implements Dropbox or Box as the backup service, which works fairly well as a backup tool. However, I would like a cloud sync feature (like Dropbox on the PC or like Google Drive) so that my notes automatically sync across devices.

Also when you have a large ongoing (""infinity"") sized document, strolling can be a little on the slower side as the document when fully sized & takes a few moments to get reconfigured / repopulate with each swipe.

S/be one single fee only and not overly expensive like so many are for their premium versions. A $9.00 one time fee would be an acceptable cost for what is being offered for the  premium upgrade.  I could use the additional features in the premium version but I don't use it enough to justify paying a monthly or yearly subscription. Change it to a one time fee and I'd be happy to give 5 ⭐ & recommend the app.,love the app but dont like when apps like this ask for a subscription to get the premium version sbe one single fee only and not overly expensive like so many are for their premium versions a one time fee would be an acceptable cost for what is being offered for the premium upgrade i could use the additional features in the premium version but i dont use it enough to justify paying a monthly or yearly subscription change it to a one time fee and id be happy to give recommend the app

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,4,"Background: I came from IOS on an ipad mini and iphone, this app replaced Notability... Almost.   The Good: Drawing features are excellent. Love the touch sensitivity built into the stylus of the note. Differentiating stylus input from finger input is so great. I can draw with the stylus, and if needed, zoom in with my fingers, draw a marquee around an object it with my finger to select it, and then scale, copy, move or delete with no tool chagning. I bought all the add-on's after the free trial period without even hesitating. They're all  extremely useful. Although, to be fair, a little expensive. In most cases, it's easy to manipulate images from other apps through sharing and/or opening into squid/papyrus.    The Bad: Editing text... aweful. Some bugginess on the widgets loosing their names in a folder for shortcuts and infinite screen size creates issues where the screen stops recognizing finger inputs at the system level, not application level.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,I bulk installed around 10 similar apps looking for something like this. Nothing offers such a well design app for note taking. This is the only one left installed. Operation is learnt in about 5 mins.  No nonsense design means you can open new or add to existing organised notes or notebooks with very few selections.  I'm using it in the context of an IT support department so I need to get going in the time it takes to pick the phone up and say 'hello'.  Writing tools are easily changable as you go with 'extras' little more than the cost of a similar paper notepad. Editing facilities are excellent with erasing / box drag select sections.  When done notes can be sent to the cloud in a couple of taps to access from anywhere to whoever selected.,i bulk installed around similar apps looking for something like this nothing offers such a well design app for note taking this is the only one left installed operation is learnt in about mins no nonsense design means you can open new or add to existing organised notes or notebooks with very few selections im using it in the context of an it support department so i need to get going in the time it takes to pick the phone up and say hello writing tools are easily changable as you go with extras little more than the cost of a similar paper notepad editing facilities are excellent with erasing box drag select sections when done notes can be sent to the cloud in a couple of taps to access from anywhere to whoever selected

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,1,"The whole point of a pdf import, for me at least, was to be able to markup a pdf already on my tablet, so when my tablet syncs with my office network, the file backs up and replaces the older file in the office network. Importing the pdf creates a new file within Papyrus that has no relation to the original. To actually use the markups, I need to pay even more for the cloud storage, which only syncs with Box and Dropbox (and from what I see in the reviews, that's not working all that well either.) So then I'd have to make the cloud version sync with the office version, and then sync that with my tablet. Way too much file duplication to bother with.   Now, if I could use Papyrus's tools to markup an existing pdf without the need to import it and create a new note, then that would be very nice. Otherwise, it leaves me feeling that the developers were being short sighted, greedy, and selfish, forcing us to pay to use the pdf function, and then forcing us to pay to actually do anything with the documents after Papyrus gets a hold of it.",the whole point of a pdf import for me at least was to be able to markup a pdf already on my tablet so when my tablet syncs with my office network the file backs up and replaces the older file in the office network importing the pdf creates a new file within papyrus that has no relation to the original to actually use the markups i need to pay even more for the cloud storage which only syncs with box and dropbox and from what i see in the reviews thats not working all that well either so then id have to make the cloud version sync with the office version and then sync that with my tablet way too much file duplication to bother with now if i could use papyruss tools to markup an existing pdf without the need to import it and create a new note then that would be very nice otherwise it leaves me feeling that the developers were being short sighted greedy and selfish forcing us to pay to use the pdf function and then forcing us to pay to actually do anything with the documents after papyrus gets a hold of it

Since my Note 2 updated to Android 4.3, the new version of S Note (with less features, and new file format I can't use on my Note 10.1 2012), and the Samsung cloud features which no longer reliably support the inter device syncing I rely on are corrupting my note files (feels like a cynical move by Samsung to force me to buy new hardware or maybe just a really really badly planned rollout).

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,5,"Why isn't Samsung Note tablet native drawing Ul/API this simple and unobtrusive? Two actual usability issues: 1) Even if a note is stored in a folder, recent notes does not show the name of the folder the note is in. Sometimes I move a note in a folder and because of a motoric error it ends up in the wrong folder. Since there is no ""sort notes by last moved to folder"", it gets really hard to find a note in such situation. 2) Accidental generation of notes: I often press the add new note button without thinking. Then I perhaps leave papyrus on in the background. I end up closing the note at some point but don't remember if I wrote something in it. Then it gets annoying since I need to check if the note has contents - that does not necessarily show in the note icon - before deleting the note, to make sure I don't delete anything that matters. So not saving notes at all before they have any content or their name set would probably be a good idea.  Also, I would like a fill tool.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs",Unknown,2,"I use Papyrus on a daily basis because it is very good. Still I only rate it 2stars because it is still missing the basic functionality that every note taking app has.  For example: it is impossible to see if a note has a next page or not. You just have to try in each note you open to press the next button. If you get a blank page then there was no next page... Gets very annoying after a time. How difficult can it be to just put an indicator like ""page 1of 6""?  There is also no way the system remembers your zoom-level. I like to zoom out on a page when I open a note to see all the contents on a page. Then, when going to the next page, it forgets about this and zooms back tot the default. If you quickly want to browse through the pages of a note to look for something, then you have to zoom out or pan on every page of the note. I am getting really tired of this.   The developer seems to be concentrating on adding more advanced features, but forgets about the basics.  The good part of Papyrus is the actual writing. The most fluid and easy to use of all the apps I tried.
