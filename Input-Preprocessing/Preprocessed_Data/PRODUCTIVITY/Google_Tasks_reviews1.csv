I gave 3 stars for some reasons: 1 - The web version in calendar web offer more features than the application. I believe it should be the opposite. In calendar, I can rearrang tasks, move between list and more 2 - Not able to see all your task in one place 3 - No search capabilities I'm limited to 500 words. So I hope the developper take that into consideration and include those features.
