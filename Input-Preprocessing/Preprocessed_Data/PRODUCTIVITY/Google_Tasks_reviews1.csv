I'm a workspace subscriber, and I still have to use other apps",ok im googles biggest fan and test multiple apps and services for them as well as learning to develop with their developers program so when i say that tasks is an absolutely terrible app it pains me to say it yet my words couldnt be any more true it has never worked to alert me about tasks ive attempted to use it periodically hoping this issue would be resolved but i dont think the apps potential is being taken seriously im a workspace subscriber and i still have to use other apps

Google Tasks,Unknown,4,メールやカレンダーをGoogle製で固めているAndroidユーザーにオススメ。Gmailからタスクを簡単に追加でき、追加したタスクからは当該メールへのリンクが張られる。期限を設定したタスクはGoogleカレンダー上の期限の日時に表示される。 タスク管理アプリとしてはシンプル。タスク管理アプリに求めることは一通りできる。 中の人へのフィードバッグとしては、タスクの詳細に画像を貼れるようにして欲しいです。贅沢を言うならばGoogle Keepの各メモぐらいの表現力が欲しいです。,メールやカレンダーをgoogle製で固めているandroidユーザーにオススメgmailからタスクを簡単に追加でき追加したタスクからは当該メールへのリンクが張られる期限を設定したタスクはgoogleカレンダー上の期限の日時に表示される タスク管理アプリとしてはシンプルタスク管理アプリに求めることは一通りできる 中の人へのフィードバッグとしてはタスクの詳細に画像を貼れるようにして欲しいです贅沢を言うならばgoogle keepの各メモぐらいの表現力が欲しいです

And couldn't due dates be BESIDE tasks rather than above them (future) or below them (overdue)? I can't find any setting options to do these things.
