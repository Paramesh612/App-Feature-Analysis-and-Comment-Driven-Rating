Works perfectly for Chromebook. There is just ONE thing that I can live with, but would love to change and is the option to select as touch mode or as pointer mode in Word and Spreadsheets. When you have long-typed files, and you have to select a part of it, there is no way with the pointer to do it. You have to select something they drag the markers. That is totally doable, but it's frustrating when you have a mouse (I'm using Pixelbook).

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF",Unknown,3,"*TRIED THE TOP 5 DOCUMENT APPS, including this, AND FOUND THESE OUT* PRO(S): It has a beautiful and a user-friendly design. CON(S): Compared to the other 4 apps, it uses the MOST SPACE in my phone's storage, which badly affects the speed of my phone. Though I understand that the app needs the space to function in a better way. But of course, I believe that this part can still be improved. Also, to convert a file into a .pdf file, you need a PRETTY HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY, unlike some of its similar apps, which offer this feature without the need of money. Nevertheless, I can say that it's a pretty good app so thank you devs and I hope you'll still improve this app. :)",tried the top document apps including this and found these out pros it has a beautiful and a userfriendly design cons compared to the other apps it uses the most space in my phones storage which badly affects the speed of my phone though i understand that the app needs the space to function in a better way but of course i believe that this part can still be improved also to convert a file into a pdf file you need a pretty huge amount of money unlike some of its similar apps which offer this feature without the need of money nevertheless i can say that its a pretty good app so thank you devs and i hope youll still improve this app

While you're editing you get random pop-up ads every minute or so, with occasional video ads. Then, when you're done with the file and try to close it, you have to sit through yet another 30-second ad. Then, to finish with a cherry on top, trying to close the app brings up one last pop-up ad.
