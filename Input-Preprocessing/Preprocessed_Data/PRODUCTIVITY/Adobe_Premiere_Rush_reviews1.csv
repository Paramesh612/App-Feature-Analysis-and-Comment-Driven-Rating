First you can't just add a text title. All clips have to touch so to get a moment of black you have to do a whole convoluted ordeal using an effect and I hate it. You also can't put in a solid color so you can't just add a like black frame spacer you also can't click a clip and trim it using numbers.

At least that's what I think with how things work in Rush. There are layers. There are clips that you can move around. It's intuitive. The essentials are there. Titles, sounds, filters, transitions, they're all there. One star less from a rather perfect score because the video during editing just froze. When played, the audio continues but the video is still. After rewinding the video over and over to see if it helps, it just went to a black screen instead. I had to restart the app. Bad way to get the new users hooked. Nonetheless, my rush project was finished... in a rush. Sadly, but not unexpectedly, there are only three export chances.
