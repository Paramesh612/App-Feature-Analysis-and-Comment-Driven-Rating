Google Keep - Notes and Lists,Unknown,2,Ability to sort a checklist alphabetically would be very useful. A redesign/clean-up of the user interface is long overdue - there's way too many different buttons/menus with no intuitive reason on why some functionality is hidden behind (1) the 3 dots at the top or (2) the 3 dots at the bottom or (3) the + sign at the bottom. After years of use I still have to search through the different menus to find the setting I'm after.,ability to sort a checklist alphabetically would be very useful a redesigncleanup of the user interface is long overdue theres way too many different buttonsmenus with no intuitive reason on why some functionality is hidden behind the dots at the top or the dots at the bottom or the sign at the bottom after years of use i still have to search through the different menus to find the setting im after

Background pictures are nice but pointless if you can't see the actual note.
