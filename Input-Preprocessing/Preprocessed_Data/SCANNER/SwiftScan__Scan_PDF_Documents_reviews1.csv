SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents,Unknown,1,"Update: Rating dropped from 5-star to 1-star. Android 11 made some big changes to the Scoped Storage functionality that Google began to implement with Android 10. One of the biggest user changes is removing access to the ""Android/data"" folder. SwiftScan places all scanned files in the net.doo.snap folder within the ""Android/data"" folder. As a result, it is now impossible to access the image files with the Android default file manager, and programs such a BoxSync cannot access and upload the images created by SwiftScan. While the Advanced Settings within SwiftScan allow you to view the file path of the storage location, you cannot change the path This is a significant issue that needs to be promptly addressed to restore user functionality.",update rating dropped from star to star android made some big changes to the scoped storage functionality that google began to implement with android one of the biggest user changes is removing access to the androiddata folder swiftscan places all scanned files in the netdoosnap folder within the androiddata folder as a result it is now impossible to access the image files with the android default file manager and programs such a boxsync cannot access and upload the images created by swiftscan while the advanced settings within swiftscan allow you to view the file path of the storage location you cannot change the path this is a significant issue that needs to be promptly addressed to restore user functionality

Since CamScanner is gone, it's too much of a hassle to use two separate apps to make collages. Would buy if devs add this feature. Also preview quality is very bad and at first made me think that this app has crappy scanning quality. Once I zoomed in it became clear that this is not the case, but it's confusing and I think some 1 star reviews are due to this.",good app overall but it would be nicer if i could combine multiple scans into collage too rather than pdf since camscanner is gone its too much of a hassle to use two separate apps to make collages would buy if devs add this feature also preview quality is very bad and at first made me think that this app has crappy scanning quality once i zoomed in it became clear that this is not the case but its confusing and i think some star reviews are due to this

SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents,Unknown,5,"AMAZING! Finally an app that ""really"" does do higher resolution scans! (Camscanner unfortunately decreases resolution even from imported files) The auto shoot and crop is WONDERFUL. Only sorting and saving is a bit to get used to (I don't find it intuitive enough). I miss an option to make an album (or chosse batch), and then scan into the album, autoname files by the album and then upload the full album online (instead of having to choose indiviual files manually from the main list). The overview with all scans being thrown into one main list isn't functionally satisfying. Also too much back and forth to rename scans that belong to a named group - you have to remember to reset to a new default name each time, manually mark files and then upload. This is all handier with Camscanner (batch mode which saves all scans into a indivitual sets and let's you ""select all"" ) or Photomyne (albums). It would be nice to have a choice to do batch and then be asked what the default name of the files should be. But maybe this is already possible Scanbot and I missed it? Otherwise 10 stars! - November 3 update: I jist found out that group naming is a snap! Just choose multipage scanning. You will see the default naming scheme on the top of the screen. If you edit that filename it will be used as the default on saving and any additional scans in that set will be named in incremental steps with (1), (2), (3) etc. :D - Ich habe nicht mal gemerkt das ihr eine Deutsche Firma seid.

SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents,Unknown,3,"This is a great, very smart app with very high potential. However, I'm extremely disappointed in the feature disparity between the premium Android version and the premium iOS version. For a cross-platform service, paid teirs should offer the same features across platforms, but the Android version is significantly less functional than the iOS version:  Individual file encryption is essential for enterprise use, as well as an option to lock the app with a passcode or fingerprint. These things are available in the iOS version, and should absolutely be available for paid Android users. Without these types of cornerstones, paid users can get 90% of the features they paid for with most free apps. The premium version needs these types of things to set it apart more from competitors. Adding these features alone would bring tremendous value to the app, and could potentially bring in many more users due to the enterprise appeal.   Additionally, being able to highlight and copy, define, etc. text within the built-in PDF editor would be nice. As it stands, you can only select text in a different PDF editor or by using text mode, in which you don't have the scan as a backdrop. This comes off as a lazy attempt to get *most* of the way there, since the iOS version supports this, and the devs are clearly capable of implementing it. Another notable feature that is very common in competing apps that is omitted in Scanbot is the ability to go back to old scans and edit/re-crop the pages from the original image.  There are too many inconveniences and omissions for this app to be a true competitor with others, especially if you purchase the premium option. A few simple additions could fix most of the issues, so hopefully the developers recognize that and are working on solutions. This app has more potential than most other premium scanners, but it doesn't seize it properly on the Android platform.",this is a great very smart app with very high potential however im extremely disappointed in the feature disparity between the premium android version and the premium ios version for a crossplatform service paid teirs should offer the same features across platforms but the android version is significantly less functional than the ios version individual file encryption is essential for enterprise use as well as an option to lock the app with a passcode or fingerprint these things are available in the ios version and should absolutely be available for paid android users without these types of cornerstones paid users can get of the features they paid for with most free apps the premium version needs these types of things to set it apart more from competitors adding these features alone would bring tremendous value to the app and could potentially bring in many more users due to the enterprise appeal additionally being able to highlight and copy define etc text within the builtin pdf editor would be nice as it stands you can only select text in a different pdf editor or by using text mode in which you dont have the scan as a backdrop this comes off as a lazy attempt to get most of the way there since the ios version supports this and the devs are clearly capable of implementing it another notable feature that is very common in competing apps that is omitted in scanbot is the ability to go back to old scans and editrecrop the pages from the original image there are too many inconveniences and omissions for this app to be a true competitor with others especially if you purchase the premium option a few simple additions could fix most of the issues so hopefully the developers recognize that and are working on solutions this app has more potential than most other premium scanners but it doesnt seize it properly on the android platform

SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents,Unknown,4,"I was looking for a document scanner that could quickly create a document scan with the least amount of app navigation effort as possible and just as quickly get out of my way—because who really wants to deal with a messy and confusing document scanner app UI?  Scanbot is very simple on the surface and gets the job done with ease. After taking a scan,  you can simply tap save and exit. It's just that simple. Of course there are other options you can perform if you want, but for me, all I want is to get in and out as quickly as possible.  The most important features to me, however, is that Scanbot automatically transfers my scanned documents directly to my FreeNAS server via SFTP then deletes the original from my phone afterwards. Scanbot does this perfectly! While other document scan apps may very well accomplish this, I simply love the simplicity to which Scanbot takes care of this task.   So why would I only give Scanbot four stars? The reason is a glaring lack of public key encryption for SFTP. Without this option I am forced to make a compromise in the security of my home server to use Scanbot. If public key is added to the SFTP client, Scanbot will truly be a five-star app!",i was looking for a document scanner that could quickly create a document scan with the least amount of app navigation effort as possible and just as quickly get out of my waybecause who really wants to deal with a messy and confusing document scanner app ui scanbot is very simple on the surface and gets the job done with ease after taking a scan you can simply tap save and exit its just that simple of course there are other options you can perform if you want but for me all i want is to get in and out as quickly as possible the most important features to me however is that scanbot automatically transfers my scanned documents directly to my freenas server via sftp then deletes the original from my phone afterwards scanbot does this perfectly while other document scan apps may very well accomplish this i simply love the simplicity to which scanbot takes care of this task so why would i only give scanbot four stars the reason is a glaring lack of public key encryption for sftp without this option i am forced to make a compromise in the security of my home server to use scanbot if public key is added to the sftp client scanbot will truly be a fivestar app

SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents,Unknown,4,"As a scanner app, it works great. It's ease of use is excellent and multi-cloud service saving rocks! I like the built in QR/Barcode scan function, but it isn't recognized as a capable app in Android intents when you want to use it to scan barcodes from other apps (example: Google Authenticator). OCR works, but seems like a half done add-on since you can only run it on the entire document and then copy the results out to another app. You cannot see or edit it first. Seems like the pictures for the IOS version on the website show highlighting and copying specific text. Maybe this is a plan down the road for Android. Editing is decent with the signature function being the best. The highlighter is not adjustable so it just highlights a large section of text. I would like to see the ability to change the width of the highlighter as well as other colors added. If the barcode scanner was available to other apps and OCR was a little more robust then this app could replace three different ones. Future options I'd like to see: printing, faxing ability, text function in editing for filling scanned forms, and sectional cut-and-paste for clipping into other apps. I still recommend trying it.",as a scanner app it works great its ease of use is excellent and multicloud service saving rocks i like the built in qrbarcode scan function but it isnt recognized as a capable app in android intents when you want to use it to scan barcodes from other apps example google authenticator ocr works but seems like a half done addon since you can only run it on the entire document and then copy the results out to another app you cannot see or edit it first seems like the pictures for the ios version on the website show highlighting and copying specific text maybe this is a plan down the road for android editing is decent with the signature function being the best the highlighter is not adjustable so it just highlights a large section of text i would like to see the ability to change the width of the highlighter as well as other colors added if the barcode scanner was available to other apps and ocr was a little more robust then this app could replace three different ones future options id like to see printing faxing ability text function in editing for filling scanned forms and sectional cutandpaste for clipping into other apps i still recommend trying it
