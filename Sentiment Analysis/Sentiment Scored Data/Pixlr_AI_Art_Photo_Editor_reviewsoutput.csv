Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,App only works every 1 in 10 goes..mostly stuck on open screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled a bunch of times but just won't work?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used to be good. Total trash now. Deleting it.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Backbone of my pic editing but the recent changes to the collage editing has rendered it useless. This breaks my heart. Virtually all the updates in collage have made every function more difficult for me as a 15 year plus user and promoter of your incredible app. Pleased rethink the ability to swap out images back to the simple 'press and drag' and I'll go back to 5 stars. Thank you!,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Best wishes,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"This has always been a good app. My husband & I have been using & enjoying it for years. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the extra cost of having to buy stickers, frames, overlays, fonts, some of which used to be free & the cost of using some of the new AI features. The app also has put in new adds, most of the time they're not intrusive, but if they have to have these adds, then why can't ALL of the apps features be free?",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I have used this app for years and despite having my info leaked when they were hacked I still use it, but now it is unusable on a Samsung Z Fold. This is the first review I have ever written for any app simply because the interface is terrible and the buttons are smushed on top of each other and it is virtually impossible to use now from whatever update made it terrible.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"For years this was my preferred application for photography editing, once I bought the Pro version but after a while it became public for everyone which was a good thing , why I suggested it every one.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I used to love this app but it's now been decimated by ads and subscription. Absolutely gutted to have to uninstall it but unless you're wanting to pay a lot yearly, this is absolutely unusable.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The ads have become invasive unlike how they previously were, along with their subscription service of $10 USD Monthly which is now constantly shown on app startup. If you can handle that, it's okay. If you can't, I highly recommend you don't use this app, as it will likely continue down the path it has of aggressive and consumer unfriendly advertising.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I am making a new review. I am even more upset about the direction this app is going. I have used Pixlr as my go to editing app for many years. New is supposed to mean better, but nothing is better about what this app does now. The creators and developers have ruined it trying to keep up with AI apps even though there are already thousands of Android AI apps. I hoped they'd try and stay original, but I was failed as a user.

I really do, but I don't. And I cannot use this app because it will not open. I wouldn't be so frustrated with pixar over the years if it wasn't such a reasonably good editing app. But it WAS a better app for a decade.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Latest updates are genuinely terrible. They attempted to ""simplify"" things and wound up making half of what I used the app for significantly clunkier and less functional. No longer having numbers on aspect ratios so you can see exactly what your free adjustments are, the massively clunky hold to move on the collage (that takes forever to trigger when you want it and accidentally triggers when you don't). I gave it a bit to see if I could get used to it, but it's such a major downgrade.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The AI stuff is intrusive and gets in the way of all of the actual good features. The ads are terrible and SO long.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,good,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"It's ok for what it is. Expensive for the AI credits, especially since it doesn't work a portion of the time. I like it when it functions properly.

Nothing happens after selecting ""x"" on the notification popup about subscription price increases, making it impossible to exit out of to actually use the app. Then again, maybe such bad and unresponsive UI is to be expected from yet another tech company pushing soulless GenAI rubbish that nobody asked for.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used the app occasionally for years and it was always great. Now, there are nag screens for monthly subscriptions and several ads after every action. No thanks! Uninstalled.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Not happy with the newest update. I have been using Pixlr for years and it has served me well!

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Too censored,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I used this app mostly for the collage feature, which is now unusable. I liked that i could change the aspect ratio, and there were numbers at the top so every image i created was the same aspect ratio. Now, there are no numbers, and every time I click on an image while in the free aspect section, it kicks me out and I have to go back in, but it resets the aspect! Not unusable at all!

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,January 2025 update: This app used to be intuitive and easy to use but now it is slow and buggy. I would really love it if you guys could speed up the AI tools you have added and fix the bugs. You shouldn't have to wait so long for AI content to be generated and you definitely shouldn't get errors half the time or more when generating Nov 2024 update. I had some issues after subscribing but the developer contacted and advised me to reinstall and all my problems are now solved. Thanks team!,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to be great, but recent update has 'slowed it down'. Having to long press to move a picture instead of swiping the selected image is inconvenient. Spacing for sizing is messed up too, etc. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. It was more simple to use. New changes make it frustrating. I've always paid to use this and loved it, but I'm not enjoying it anymore and I only use this when not using the ""big name editor"".",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Utilities totally gutted or burried under garbage, ads, and packed with spyware. Goodnight sweet prince. I remember the things we made together before your guts were ransomed. App finally managed to force update itself. Solution is called FOSS.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I bought premium use of this app and now they're telling me to subscribe as well and ignoring that i bought it entirely. They also changed the UI and lost a ton of funcrionality. Really disapointed and wish the legacy app was available id bought.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"This is a new anomaly; I'm using the same phone I've been using for years. The app, now, 'freezes', about 80% of the time, these, days - when superimposing images (e.g., loading an image into a black template).",1

The claim of 'maintenance' is a thin veil for sheer greed. This app, once user-friendly, now pushes for profit over experience. The AI, meant to enhance, only destabilizes. Bombarding us with premium subscription prompts shows where priorities lie. It's not about improving the app but filling pockets. You guys are being greedy.",1

The app isn't any better than it was five or six years ago, and yet you want to charge us unreasonable fees to do away with ads.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,The user that complained about the Ads and AI being nothing then overwhelming which you the developer replied to him that the ads are there to support the app. Did you really not understand or is it just a game to you.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,A great example of how to ruin a good thing. Was a featured FREE photo editing app that was awesome. Now it's a sub based AI trash factory.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Terrible change. Used to be one of the best apps and now it's nothing but blurry, the new features suck. There was no need to change. I will be removing this now awful app",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Okay I almost let you guys get away with the 1.9 million individual data/passwords get breached and released onto a free forum in 2020 (including my own)... Then the audacity to make a pricey subscription for very basic editing software is crazy.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,All the edit buttons on the bottom of the screen are all jumbled up. Editing a photo it now impossible. The app is useless!!!! UNINSTALLED!!!!!!!!!,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"My favorite photo editor! By far, the best.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Neat and easy to use; only wisb the text editor had an outline option. edit 2024/10/04: really dislike the AI ad that pops up every time you open the app, and now realized I can't use it without internet connection (prob bc it can't load the ad); it's kind of gross to see such blatant cashgrab with AI hype, which is a bubble that's soon to burst, but i digress... please remove the ad and allow the app to run offline",3

I tried everything, unistalled, cleared the data... and it just... Won't work. Bummed. Edit after a few years. Tried it again and now it is a completely different app. And even more in a worse way. Bring back old Pixlr.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Pixlr *used to be* an excellent, bulletproof app. Crashes all the time now.. crashes consistently,and suddenly after I installed the last update. Now it doesn't open at all, even after a re-install. Way to go, developers.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"This app has always been my fav. The recent AI driven approach is nkt good. There are plenty of alternatives lit there for AI. Please, revert to ""normal"". Plus, it will be highly appeciated to have an option to buy premium features not via subscription, but via one time purchase.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This whole AI overhaul took an amazing app and made it slow, buggy, and awful. It feels like corporate run spyware now. Install an old version and never let it update",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"All good things come to an end. I used this app for years to put a final piece of art together with parts from other apps as it would integrate them flawlessly. While AI is cool it's not something I would use so it has no value to me. I already paid for its extras a few years ago and now I get comercials, constant interruptions to upgrade and limited functionality. To shell out additional money on a monthly basis is not worth it to me. Paint shop pro on my PC works fine.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Pathetic attempt to force us to use constant Internet to open the app, Also jumped on the ""AI"" band wagon didn't you?! If the Internet is turned on but not allowed for this app it won't work. I'm downgrading to the previous version which didn't force me to login or use internet!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,lacks basic image editing features like copy/cut/paste; had to switch to my PC to get the job done.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Very good app,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Downloaded this app because websites recommend it as one of the best (and only) android apps for editing RAW format images. Maybe it was, one time, now it's an instagram filter wannabe for AI bros. It doesn't even recognise RAW files.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Wow,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,This app has been a FREE 5star plus photo editor for 7-8 years. However GREED HAS CONSUMED THEM and they inserted an AI MONIKER PREFIX ON SOME OF THE SAME OLD FEATURE NAMES AND DENY YOU ANY ACCESS TO EVEN THE BASIC EDITOR BY SHOVING A 7 DAY FREE TRIAL SCREEN BLOCKER IN YOUR FACE REPEATEDLY UNLESS YOU SUBMIT TO A 7 DAY TRIAL for exactly the same functions that were FREE FOR OVER 7 YEARS. They only tagged them with the SILLY AI PREFIX. *NEWS*FLASH* IT IS OLD-WORN STUFF NOT AI! Grow Up! bye,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,used to be my go-to app for basic photo edits. now it tries to force users to pay for a subscription and shoves ai features in your face. no longer worth it.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I have been using this for a few years and unfortunately the latest UI upgrade is really bad in design along with the money grab for the use of AI tools that yes you can avoid using but seriously just stop making money grab on every area on the app. Used to be my go to and one I would recommend now it's become the avoid and soon to be removed. Shame.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,One of the best app for editing all kinds of stuff. Definitely one of my favorites üëë,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I miss the old ui. This used to be my favorite app for editing and was the best free photo app I've used and even considered paying for premium.. not anymore ): the new update is really really bad. I'm sorry for 1 star, I hope u guys can fix it.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Hate the new AI update,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This has AI now? That's an uninstall for me.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,The app decreases the quality of the photos as soon as I load them to edit.,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app for so many years... bought ALL of the filters and effects. Since the update, I am not able to access my account, and am not able to reset my password. I've contacted the developers, we'll see if they respond.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Another nice and simple app ruined with a disasterous UI and so-called ""AI"" infection. Well, pity, after many many years uninstalled.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Thank,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It no longer starts without network access permission. Downgraded to 3.5.9,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used to be free. Not anymore. Use PicsArt until that one isnt free either.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,It's ok. I wanted to use a stretch effect but it doesn't have that. So I deleted it.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Really useful, easy to use... at least that used to be the case years ago. Now they've changed the format, put a monthly charge on it, and also have an AI update that causes it to be unusable if you don't have Internet access. Thanks a whole lot, pixlr. Edit: my hopes are low, guy who replied.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to be a very good app. Latest update added a bunch of bloat and slapped the AI label front and center to let us all know they've jumped the shark Edit: no, I didn't encounter difficulty. The app looks ugly now and seeing the word AI at all immediately makes me want to use an app tenfold less.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app for years and it was ok, recently updated and now it's pushing AI junk + subscriptions, nothing will save, super annoying popups all the time. Bye.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"As an artist myself, take your AI update and shove it.. you know the rest. This was a good app before joining the bandwagon. We want tools, not toys.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Missing my favorite effects,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This new AI update is beyond terrible. The updated look and feel makes it worse to use. And the starting screen, I mean advertisement, does it HAVE to pop up every single time I open the app? I said no 20 times, it's not going to turn into a yes so stop asking me. Time to start looking for a new editing app after all these years",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"This app has good features, but when I saved a cropped image it significantly lowered the quality. Also, it is a big disappointment (and an extremely jarring change) that an app that used to cost like either $1.99 or $7.99 (can't remember) for a lifetime subscription now doesn't even have a lifetime subscription and the yearly subscription costs *many* multiples more than that, at $59.99. Who can afford that?",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"What happened? The app just opens to this new splash title page and just sits there. Reinstalled several times and restarted the device as well and still just this new startup screen with nothing. I would have given it 4 or five stars but then this happened. Forced to give it a 0. If I can't use it,not worth it.ü§∑",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I've used this app for years and it's been incredible. This new update absolutely broke it in so many ways rendering it nearly unusable. So disappointed.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I've been using the original version for years .. I'd love to have it as an option to use the old one instead please !,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Everything is a paywall. It was a better company years ago. Totally corrupted by the desperation for endless profits. Really not worth the effort unless you are willing to spend a bunch of money monthly for multiple subscriptions to access everything here.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Good apps,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Cash grab. Congrats on your AI tools. You took away the premium overlays that I already paid for.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Can't even open anything! So frustrating!,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Take your meaningless 'AI' buzzword and shove it. Gone.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I've been using Pixlr regularly for about 10 years now. While I noted some decline in quality since Autodesk sold the app to this new company, it's still the best editing app I've come across, and is still my go-to photo editor. I'll be honest, I was worried about major changes as soon as I saw the AI update. But thankfully, the old features remain the same, only with a fresher look. Please, never change those original features!",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to be great, they've added a bunch of AI garbage and a subscription fee. I don't trust any company using AI not to steal my intellectual property. Will not be using any more.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I previously purchased this app, it *was* great for quickly editing photos of my work before posting on socials. Now you've gone and erased my previous purchase and my email. This just isn't fair to long time users.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I used to really love this app before the update. I used it for all my creative needs. Now it's almost useless to me. It won't let me crop or color correct. I have no need for the AI templates or cutesy add ons. Please consider putting it back to the way it was.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,preferred the old version.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Good apps,4

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"This is the best photo editing app for android, I am using it for over a decade and it's still best app I can find, it's sad that there is no option to purchase ads free version separately from subscriptions, but from functionality standpoint, all important features are free and ads are not on every corner so i can get over that, over all very good experience.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"If somebody wants to sit there and actually edit a photo, they be better off using the browser version.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"The AI is fine but the only update that was really needed is the ability to edit text after placing it in the photo. I've been using this app for like 8 years, just sucked to watch it change.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Updated to be hot garbage that wants to shove generative AI down your throat. The main functions of the app don't actually seem to work anymore either. I paid for this a couple years ago. I will be manually downgrading back to a version that doesn't include generative AI, and I won't be giving them another penny. It's an ethics issue, and if they want to incorporate generative AI they can absolutely shove it up their collective rears. Unacceptable.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"It's the only app I know which allows me to brighten or darken a portion of the screen/photo as opposed to the whole thing. As such it's invaluable. Recently, I stumbled upon double exposure. I had no idea what it did but I learned that it allows us to put two photos together very, very well. I'm impressed with that. It doesn't do a lot of things but the things that it does do it does well",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I thought this app was done with the glitching, I've had a problem with editing photos on it and after updating it again a few minutes ago, I still can't use double exposure and other tools.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,I have used pixler for over 10 years and I used to love it until I started finding other apps they did a lot more because picture refuses to upgrade their app they have the same features that they did 10 years ago and have added nothing to it. It's the same as it was 10 years ago.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"After all of these years, using this app for making my memes and custom artwork, you idiots change the app around. Unintalled. Bye Felicia!",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"New update may be the worst update I've ever seen for an app. The User Interface is a downgrade by a billion years so much so I may need to find a new app. AI is bad too but regardless of that, the AI aspect should've been a seperate, original app. This is just awful! Wish I could rate 0 stars.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,After updating app.. pixlr not working,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,How sad.... I've been using this for years and I loved it but now they're doing the silly yearly plan weekly and monthly plans for a crazy amount of cash.... $59.99 for a full year... this is insanity or even $3.69 weekly that's crazy too that's more than Netflix monthly.... I can understand making a little money but this is ridiculous. Uninstalling and finding a new program now how disappointing.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Love it,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It doesn't allow you to make a collage with an entire photo it'll cut it out so if you want to see your workout progress you can't because it'll cut off most of the photo.

Most of the features in the app are either broken or paid and I wasn't even able to save the picture. I doubt what purpose this app serves now. Improvement in the stock camera apps of phones and AI have significantly reduced dependence on photo editing apps these days, but it doesn't mean game over.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"All of the reveiws by ""a google user"" are all faked by them, not letting the app speak for itself. Contacted them about fixing a bug in their app as they said to do and they just told me to use another one of their apps that doesn't even do what I need that pixlr does. Yet the last update was somewhat recent. So Idk if they are supporting the app still or not.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"So frustrated by the recent bugs. Used this for years now but within the last few months it spontaneously crashes in the middle of editing a photo, goes back to the home screen, and I lose all progress. Contemplating spending the money to switch to photoshop just to avoid this constant frustration.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Editing are good like a Photoshop,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Can't find the resize image option. Terrible app,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I used this app for years and the occasional adds were fine. Now there are adds all the time and they freeze so I'm unable to save the edits I've been working on. So disappointing.... time to find a new go-to photo editor.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I spent 2 hours editing a photo and drawing in pieces in a composite that were missing for Pixlr to glitch when saving and delete all my work with no option of recovery. Update: 5 months later and this issue is still not fixed, use any other app",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,ADS are a problem. - Forces a click on the video ads in order for the app to begin export & save photo. The vid does not load until you tap so it takes you to the ads web page + still need to watch the vid. To circumvent this - use the app in airplane mode. I understand developers need ad $ but this is an annoying way to generate it. I support pixlr on web app (aka I pay) but that purchase doesnt transfer. All around lame & invasive ad tactics is making this editing app less desirable.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Awful video ads. I don't always have good reception so the ad just sits there until I force close the app. Also doesn't preserve PNG transparency?? It's getting to the point where I don't even want to use this app anymore. Are there any good alternatives? I've been using this for years but it's time to get something else.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,It's good app,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"This app used to be amazing for me. Now projects get lost cause ads for Facebook, which I don't have any desire to get, freeze and won't load properly, forcing you to have to close the app and restart your work.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"After many years using this app now Sucks! So now after working editing an image and spending so much time on it there is an ad before you can actually save the image to your phone and that ad gets stuck so can't save the image... ""Genius"" who thought of doing that so people can watch another ad before actually saving their work... Now for me this app is COMPLETELY USELESS, have to look for another developer",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"I have loved this app. It's still good, but at keast half the time the ads Won't Go Away. I try to save and sometimes I get a pop up ad that does its thing and moves on, but others will not stop. If I see the one with Dio de los Muertos I know I've lost my work because the ad won't quit. Maybe in the next bug fix?",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The paintbrush and eraser tool does not work what is the point of having it if you don't allow it the customer to use it I'm glad I didn't waste my money on your app because it's garbage uninstalling and never downloaded it again,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Full screen ads glitch and don't play, saving is impossible. Yet another useful app totally ruined and demolished, rendered useless by its own dev team. What an absolutely shameful thing to do to such great software. Absolutely shameful",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Amezing, mind-blowing, fantastic.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I PAID to remove ADS. Now the app has changed to SUBSCRIPTION model with lengthy ads. It does not restore my l purchase or revert to the version I paid for. Bait & Switch!,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I like your app but I don't like dealing with the adds so I'm going to find another app to use!!!,3

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I can't support this company anymore. I got their original app, Pixlr-O-matic. LOVED it & paid and DL'd EVERY filter they had. When they came out with this one, I did the same. BUT with every new phone (and let's face it, we have to get new ones every so often) it was more and more difficult to download the filters I had PAID for. Now, I can't. NO ONE can. Look up Pixlr-O-matic, read the recent reviews. You'll see the complaints. And if they'll do that to the app that made them, expect it here.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Terrible, ads are intrusive and annoying. üòí",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The ads do. Not. Stop. The same long Instagram ad now appears every time I do anything with this app. I deleted it.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Everything was perfect until some of the fonts stopped working...,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Very useless. Made me watch the ads to not let me save the pictures I edited. Waste of time. Won't recommend. Avoid using this app. Would put zero star if I could. Bye.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"It's very good, and user-friendly. The collage feature is very in-depth too. I will say though, it's a bit lacking in features for adding text to images. But most of all, no matter what edit you make to an image even if it's minor, if an image passes through this app, the fidelity of the whole image goes down a decent amount.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"No longer any good I used to LOVE this app. Now, it never wants to save the image. I get the ads--whatever. I wouldn't mind them if the image actually saved after watching them but it doesn't. Uninstalling. There are so many similar apps that are user friendly compared to this one.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app for years and loved it, but recently the ads have gotten far too intrusive. Half the time you go to save something, it plays a 15-second-long video. The ad pop-up is also deliberately delayed to bait you into clicking it when you try to hit the ""save"" button, which minimizes the app and opens the ad link. Worst of all, the ads frequently get stuck indefinitely, forcing you to close the app and start over. Was good once, became trash, trash gets dumped.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Very bad app to use. Don't use pls üòî,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Useless as photo editor, the very basics photo editors on most phones these days have more functionality than this app, the Galaxy S22s photo editor blows it out the water.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,App stalls when ads load and prevents saving work. App has become unusable. Will be uninstalling and finding an alternative.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Worst app,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Something has changed. Suddenly there is no way to perform multiple edits on a picture/jpg and save the resulting image. The downarrow for saving never shows up. What gives?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Too many adds, not enough editing options. Been using the app for years to join two or or more pics, but the ridiculously long adds keep replaying several times preventing saving the image and the editing tools could be better. Devs, if everyone has the same complaint, look into it",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Sorry, if you think i have time to read a thousand page software agreement to try & figure out what your app does or doesn't do to my device & my privacy going forward, even ifi delete; you're sadly mistaken & you certainly don't have me backed into a corner with anything else in to choose from for a photo editor....well your even sadlier mistaken..... FAIL.....NEXT !",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Useful app but now there are video ads that must fully play through. Can't even finish/save my project if my internet sneezes. Ads are fine but let's be reasonable devs.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Useless,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Still a good tool. Ads not worth it though.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Bad,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was great until the newest update. When you go to save a long ad starts to play that after it's finished you can then save. The issue, the ad freezes and never finishes, thus not allowing you to save at all.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Can't save images. It forces you to watch an ad before you can save but the ad always gets stuck/ never finishes and keeps starting over. Do not recommend.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Wanted to edit one image was invaded by ads, was unusable",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Used to be great. The ads continually get stuck and you can never download the pics lately. Not sure what's up.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It used to be my main editing software. For years. Now is just flooded with ads. What a shame,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used it for years but now these ridiculously long ad videos are too much. Y'all wack for this one.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Avarage,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,App changed added ads will not get past ads to save photos keeps going back to the editing page every time you push done it goes to the ads you exit the ads it goes back to the editing page it's a cycle that doesn't stop there's no settings anywhere before editing to show the download file location that needs to be fixed the app is worthless without being able to save your progress I used to love this app now it sucks sorry,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Very nice tools!,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I've used this app forever now but the ads are just ridiculous now. Why do I have to watch an unstoppable 30sec ad just to make an edit that took me 2 seconds to do? I'm not using this anymore.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,These ads have gotten out of hand. I can't even browse filters without an ad playing. This needs to stop.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Collage crops don't work, crops out everything. Doesn't apply edits to photos. When I use the paint or erase tool and hit the checkmark to apply changes it just cancels the changes. ADS ARE RIDICULOUS. CONSTANT AFTER EVERY EDIT. YOUR GREED IS DISGUSTING. UNINSTALLING.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,",,, luv it",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Long time user but the app has become unusable mobile wise with all the ads and app crashing. Never had issues until the last update. Also extremely Pixelates images after saving on the app now. Better to just use the pc version of pixlr unless pixlr app makes some changes that make it less of a headache to use.,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I rely on this app to make quick posters and it easy and fun!,5

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Good,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It WAS great. ...but now just internet junk like most of the rest. Sad,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Best app for photo editing,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This was a fantastic app that I used for years but they recently introduced insanely long and unskippable garbage ads. I was 100% okay with pop-up ads the occassional video but they got too greedy. Uninstalled forever. Byyye.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,My favourite ... Love this app. Thank you very much,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to love this app I would use it every single day, now there are just way too many ads it's bananas. I would give this thing five stars in the heartbeat but now since the ads are all over the place now you can't even edit half the time I'm going to have to give it a one.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Sweet editing,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Q: Where does it save when you press 'done'? A: It doesn't,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Why did you remove the noise filter in the image? Now this program has no superiority over other programs. Noise creation is best filter,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The long, intrusive ads make this unusable.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app on a regular basis. Friends would ask me to edit pictures or create funny memes for them. The advertisement for the mother/daughter game is extremely long, boring, and to save a picture you have to sit there for roughly one minute in the entirety of the preview before you can ""X"" out of the preview. I won't be using this app anymore and will be deleting it. Short advertisements are one thing, but it just isn't worth it anymore. It was fun while it lasted, then it wasn't",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was always my go-to editing app for pictures, but now it won't let me save photos. I just get ads in my face whenever I try to save them. Even after watching the ad, it will freeze and not save any of my picture edits. Looks like I'll have to find another app.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Great app to edit, mix photos.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Its amazingly effective app....i m using this since 5 years and i m happy,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I used to love this app now it's the worst app ever with the stupid ridiculously long ads that constantly freeze. other people have posted about this and they just reply with yOu ShOuLd bE AbLe tO eXiT tHe aD aFteR ViEwiNg. no you can't you stupid morons because you can never get through the stupid ad. fix the problem or stfu.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,a 30second unkippable ad every time I want to even do a simple edit like just cropping a picture? I enjoy using this app and would pay for a premium version to remove ads. but subscription only? this is just ridiculous,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads out of control,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"RIP Pixlr: too many flaws for money. It's missing histogram curves editor (have a look at Huawei, Asus Zenfone and so many others...) and custom ratio crop. Denoise filter is missing, too. No image resize option. Not enough improvements since 2015. And you ask us to pay for it? Downgraded from 3 to 1**... Sorry, guys! Nothing else to say.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Deleted my collage cuz of an ad crashing the app. It seems small but thats frustrating when you spend time creating something. Just use something else.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I've had this for years. It's great but i can no longer save photos. Every time I'm 'done' an ad pops out and when I the ad is over the photo doesn't even save. It takes me back to the editing screen. What a waste of time. I watched the same ad 4x and none of my photos were saved,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was my go-to for, literally, years. But the constant ads and the fact that they're freezing now, making me have to start all over again, I just can't anymore. You developers should give me the option to buy instead of renting every month for no ads.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Cant erase anything,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Trash now,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I honestly love the app. The ads kind of are a pain to get to load, so I would recommend screenshotting your piece before you hit done so at least you can save your work if the app crashes due to the ad, but overall I love this app! Especially the brightness/darkness brushes. Those are so great and highlighting specific spots in your photos!",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The ads are ridiculous now. This sucks.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This app was great before but now it plays those HORRIBLE long game ads when you want to save your photo and they glitch and never finish. If this isn't fixed, I'm definitely going to change to another app and uninstall.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"There is a 60 second ad of a cartoon mother and daughter crying, 100% of the time I try to save a picture. It always freezes partway through, and if you click it, it restarts. It never plays. It never finishes the ad. It is literally impossible to save your photos now. Get an app that doesn't suck.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to be a PERFECT app. Now they joined everyone else with lame subscriptions or you'll be spammed with long, soul crushing ads. I'd be willing to do a one and done one payment price (like 10 to 12 bucks) to pay for the app versus the yearly garbage but they don't offer that.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to LOVE this app. Been using it for YEARS on ALL my quick phone shot edits. But now, whenever I save, the result is always a blurry image that looks MUCH worse than what I see while editing. What happened!? It looks like a blur mask is applied by default, during saving!",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used Pixlr as my primary editing app for many years. Until the most recent update, it was by far my favorite app for creating graphics. Since the update I've noticed several features are no longer available. I can no longer enlarge or reduce the size of a late image. Turning an image 90¬∞ is no longer possible when laying one image over another. I also am no longer able to increase the size of an image with two fingers in order to see minute details that may need to be edited.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Nice,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"An ad popped up on the save screen and froze the app, causing me to lose all the progress I made. Thanks, very cool.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Update: fullscreen. unskippable. Video ads. Every Time You Save. The only option to remove ads is a subscription. I had re-downloaded to give it a second chance but this is disgusting. Looking elsewhere. F this app.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Hii wow¬°,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was an excellent app till the last update. Now to save, they start to play the stupidly long ad with the crying mother and daughter game, which always freezes. If you click on the ad and then back up, it starts the ad over just to freeze again. The only thing to do it exit out of the app. Either way, the outcome is you cannot save your work. Worthless",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I've used this for years and years and loved it until now. After the last update every single time you go to save it pops up the save screen then forces an ad in front of it. And the ads have been glitching as well so you end up just losing all your work. I'm going to find another app that actually works.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Great until it comes time to save and the Homescapes ad freezes on my phone. Please remove Homescapes ad, there is clearly a glitch in it.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This app allways was my first choice in terms of mobile photo edditing , and it was a fantastic app for years untill it isn't anymore , bugs, glitches and etc.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,They brought the ads back. Super annoying. I get the need for ads but right in the middle of working on something an ad opens. So I just get out of it and do it on another app.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"It used to be my favorite photo editing app until the absolutely insufferable ads started. One thing would be to include new, better features and label them as Premium, other to add a bunch of useless, unrelated advertisements that pop up multiple times and sometimes even lag out, preventing you from saving the image and making you lose all your progress. Avoid it and search for something better to spend your money on because they even have some ridiculously priced subscription for what you get.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I've used the free version for years and it has been great. There was some loss of functionality after the Android 13 update, but the developers were quick to correct it. Very responsive support team.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Here I am, rating this app only because the ads are so annoying. Don't bother with this unless you're going to pay for it. It used to be good. Not anymore.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Not good for me,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Best pic editing app I've ever used. Had it for years,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I bought Pixir because as I said before it is excellent. I do not know how I would manage without it. The adds were not annoying as they appeared when the graphic was done but Pixir is so very good that deserves to be supported. Pixir is also very easy to use indeed. I said it before and I say it again: Thank you for a super app! Deserves 6 stars!,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I used this app for years but there is no way to save edits anymore. It's an endless cycle of ads and no option to save.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"I wish we had the option of free trial without using a card.You can't force me to subscribe your app pay first than use terms.I am interested in your offer to use offline.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Good,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"I have used this app for a good while but the redundant ads after every single edit is bonkers. I wouldn't mind if it was every so often to support the free app but every time I save an edit, the same 3 ads...is there an ad free version?",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Nice app,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to be a great app but they really went overboard with ads. The ad for prostate cancer meds was full minute long and made me sit through it twice in a row. Most of the time ads will freeze until I tap the screen, which then opens up the ad's website. Don't know if that's just me but seems weird that I have to click on the ad in order to get the app working again. Also they don't include a mute button which sucks if you're listening to music since you have to use your phone's volume buttons",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,After adding ads the experience has been awful. App has become unusable. You go to save your edits and the ad runs then freezes. No way to skip the ad and return to your edit. Only option is to close the ap and restart the edit. That is if the next ad doesnt freeze also.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Great editing app but recently long video ads make it inefficient to use.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,EDITED - Developer replied and the issue with collages being non-functional is now fixed so I'm putting my score up to 5 because everything I use it for is working fine again. Haven't encountered the infinite looping ads issue myself but I also set my ads to be non-personilized which kills a lot of suspect ads from experience.,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I've had this app on my phone for yrs used it all the time and I would still be using it but it won't save anything guess im gonna have to Uninstall it and find one that does. Or is there a fix in near future???,3

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I really loved this app and I think it's extremely useful even now however I am uninstalling because it's been almost a year and I have not used it once and the reason I stopped using it is because after updating my Google One membership and getting access to the premium features in Google photos it makes this app as well as a lot of other photo apps irrelevant. However I still highly recommend this to anyone looking for a creative edge.,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,insane amount and length of ads to a near unusable degree. turn off wifi and mobile data before opening the app and it becomes tolerable ;),1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"No cut-and move option. Intrusive 3-minute+ long unskippable ads that will not buffer, every time you select a new tool.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The app has become unusable in the last month due to the ads, you cannot exit the ads to save your images. It just gets stuck in a replay loop. I used to use this app several times per day so I still try to use it out of habit but I can never save anything anymore. I see I'm not the only one having this problem and Pixlr's response is not saying they're fixing it but rather that it shouldn't be happening. We know that.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Loved the app for years but the ads are too much. I understand the need for revenue but software companies are the worst for switching a free piece of software to a paid one. You can't step backward when making the switch and expect to retain any loyalty or good will because you're creating a bait and switch and people hate that.

These intrusive ads, that last longer than 30 seconds before you can close them to be able to save your work is going to drive people away",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Was great but now spoiled by excessive advertising. Difficult to use.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was one of my favourite apps but it is impossible to save now as an advert pops up full screen and there is no X to close the advert. Any touch of the screen redirects you to google play to encourage you to install the app being advertised. Clicking back just takes you to the advert again and there is no way of saving the picture you created. It's an endless loop of advert, google play, advert, google play. So I have had to install as the app is now unusable.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"30+ seconds for an obnoxious ad just to save a photo is ridiculous... Two types of free.. community supported or ad ridden. Take a guess which one Pixlr is.... Would honestly have a lite version with basic features, minimum ads and a pro version that's feature rich with no ads but requires an upfront purchase...",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The app was great until they added video adds, its insufferable now",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Won't stop crashing, I keep losing all my progress and it's wasting my time. Also whenever you save your work to you device the quality always drops so it looks pixelated and terrible. Wish I could give it no stars",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Like many others, I used this for years as my go-to editor. The ads have made me give up on it.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Once it was excellent app. I'm working with the app since last 8 years. But now a day adds disturbing and taking much more time. Really Ridiculous.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The ads are locking up the app, giving you a permanent black screen that can't be closed or backed out of, and Pixlr has become completely unusable.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The ads are painful. I've used this app for years, and wanted to buy an ad-free version but it's not an option so I think I'll explore changing apps, sadly.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"What is with all the frign adds lately!! You make one adjustment, add. Try to save, add! Start new edit, add. ! Add add add !!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I used to love this app. I didn't mind a few ads... but now it's made useless by those. Obnoxious, loud, annoying, and absolutely not interesting stuff I do not, will not, and now am most discouraged from ever downloading or buying! Uninstalling PIXLR. (And any other app that lets greed override common sense.)",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I used this app almost every day but now I have to delete due to the obnoxious full screen, non closeable ads. I try to exit out of them and it just takes me to the app store to download the app shown in the ad over and over and I can't save the photo I've edited because I have to force close the app to get the ad to stop playing. Why would you ad this horrible feature to this app??? Edit: you say you've fixed the ads but I just tried to save an edited photo and it's the same. Stop lying.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,App keeps crashing and the ads are now completely unavoidable. Ads seem to cause the app to crash and they take up the entire screen. What used to be a great app has been getting progressively worse.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This was my go to photo until the recent change to painfully long ads. I now use Snapseed. So much better.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Popup complains about paypal can not turminate, try to login into some trading software, might have Malware catious !",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Was once great. Now it's absolute garbage. This app is a MASTER CLASS of what NOT to do.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Adds don't close. Horrible. Would be great app if the adds closed.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Too much advertising, very aggressive take over ad when you finish.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I changed from 5 stars to 1. Since the last updates the ads are so invasive that you can't save anymore, nor share to another app. They pop out and then they force you to install it. No way to go back and save. Awful! And now useless! If you thought you resolved the issue: NO IT ISN'T! IT ISN'T SOLVED, N I DON'T FEEL LIKE CONTACTING YOU VIA EMAIL AFTER I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE ISSUE!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Very worst nowadays,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I used this app for many years, I'm only using it for one or two features so I'd gladly pay a one time fee I don't want to pay a subscription - I already have enough of those. Now with the ADS it is impossible to use. Adios!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I'm very old user of pixlr but now ads services really very bad no option for skip add even if we install that app which they force us to install after installation there's no option for skip that ad,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Use to be good. Now so many annoying ads.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Great app, been using it for years. The recent implementation of intrusive advertisements before you can save your work is truly awful. Pixlr claims that you can close them after 5 seconds, but generally you can't. You have to wait over 30 seconds to close the ad, and often when clicking on the X to do so, it will instead take you to the PlayStore to the ad page. I understand that you need to make money, but you're driving users away. You won't profit from uninstalls and 1 star ratings.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Delete my response and now im giving a 1 star , pathetic service",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I have to watch 15 seconds add for saving my Pic? No thanks, bye bye",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Innumerable adds,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Ads block me from saving my edited pics. Every time I try to save, ANOTHER AD POPS UP! I had to uninstall this app! And having to pay a monthly fee to remove ads is downright ridiculous! I'm not for this AT ALL. Save yourself from swimming through a sea of ads to edit your photos. You're better off looking elsewhere.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Great App, Totally Over the Top With Adds. What used to be a completly acceptable level of adds as - from about a month ago - become something completing annoying and time consuming. Also they're kinda ""tricky"" adds with multiple screens like some annoying guy at the store asking three times ""you're sure you don't want to buy this?"". Considering other options. Used to really enjoy using it. Thanks!!!",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"I used to use the Pixlr website for editing, which has a lot more options than the app. The app is still very good tho, which is why I'm giving four stars. However, some things I'd love to see are adding photos on top of each other, having more control over what color to choose, and tweaking lightening and darkening pictures to where you don't have to enter and exit the tool to make it darker/lighter. Good app regardless!",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads have become so invasive that they're breaking the app mid edit,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was my favourite app for many years, but the Ads are soooooooo long. I appreciate it's a business and you have to make money, but I wouldn't recommend Pixlr to anyone now. Goodbye üëã",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"My go to app for years. Ads didn't bother me: in fact, it was reassuring to see an ad because it meant my picture saved. The problem is not the ads, the problem is when they are 5 minutes long, unskippable and sound. Feels like I am on one of those ""water sorter"" games. This completely ruins it for me. It cheapens app so much. I'd pay a ¬£5 fee for lifetime use of the app. Not a monthly subscription. Thank god for snapseed. Il",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Used this app for a long time and always rated it highly. Recently you are forced to watch ads before you can save work. Very annoying, I've started using other editing apps recently.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Toooooooooo much of ad... Worst ever app. I ever used..!,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Ad after ad after ad. Don't mind a few. But ones you can't even get rid of?? . Used to be good. Now I've had to uninstall it.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Ads do NOT close after 5 seconds or so. And in fact 2 ads pop up. One right after the other. I don't mind seeing some ads like it was for years. The new ads are overwhelming. And app crashes often. Very often. I used to love this app. And no, it's not worth some crazy subscription. It should just be a one time purchase. And understandably in app purchases if need be. But, that's it. So sad to have had to delete this app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Was a great App But now Ads are disturbing!!,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Amazing,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Ridiculous ad walls. Not worth it. I used this app for several years and it was great, but suddenly it's gone to trash. Not to mention it not longer allows me to save anything. Don't bother!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The save button has stopped working it just plays videos and then deletes the picture I worked so hard on,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Real nice - developer gives middle finger + ""subscribe if you don't like it"" reply. Full screen video ads take over my entire phone. I cannot press any buttons, back out, or swipe to another app. Can't even press my Home button. Any click/swipe anywhere on screen (even Back, Recent Apps, and Home buttons!) forces an unwanted click on the ad & opens other apps on my phone. This behavior is completely unacceptable; forcing people to click full screen ads by taking over their buttons is unethical.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"From 5 stars to one... Sad to see one of the best mobile photo editor dropping it's quality. Full of bugs, crashes and sometimes unusable. Edit: even after 1 year and a half they cannot fix the app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,We don't mind ads but the app takes very long to laod,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I have been using Pixlr for the better part of 5 years. You are killing this app. Please remove the super invasive video ads and go back to banner ads. You are ruining the user experience, and it makes me not want to buy the premium version to support you. Stop deleting negative reviews and listen to your install base.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The developer has become a bit sketchy. Tons of annoying ads that take you to the Play Store. Consider this before installing this app, but I would avoid it, a shame since it was good before.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Excessive bombardment with advertisements after every click and tap, for anything and everything you try to do. There is no possibility to pay for a lifetime license, because the developer decided to bleed customers dry ad infinitum with recurring subscription fees, which after two years amount to more than the most expensive competitor product costs to buy. Guess what consequently replaced this milkingware? Uninstalled.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I keep getting warnings about not having paid. I don't know why this is, as my payment info has not changed. RecenyI got an updated debit card, but I've been getting this message for many months before that. Now I'm being told this is my final warning. What can I do? edit: great job handling that situation. i paid for the premium version, continued to pay when you switched to a subscription model, and now you can't even be bothered to *take my money* i'm through.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"The adds on the free version are a bit overboard. It is making it impossible to use the app. It even interrupts sometimes more than once when I am trying to save a photo. It is continuous and opens up all sorts of tabs on my phone. From religion (I am atheist) , FB (which I already have) to games (which I never play). The adds go on forever. I understand the need for adds but the way it is done now makes it most unpleasant as almost each photo I edit is interrupted which is too much.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I deleted then repeated and now it works,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I use it mainly for cropping images and some of its free fonts and frames. Not my favorite app, but still very useful. Edit: It used to be great! Like so many others are saying, they now force ads on you even once you've shared your work to another app. And when you try to go back, you have to start from zero. Very annoying! Look elsewhere!",3

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,App won't even open anymore. The ads are out of control. Edit: They only care about the fact that I commented on ads and not that the app doesn't even open. Don't waste your time with this app and find something else. I already uninstalled this app and will not give it another chance based on that response. The app itself does not open.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Wow way to ruin one of the best photo editors with unskippable without clicking and opening ads you absolute nailed it.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"By far, my favourite mobile photo app. Until the adverts hijacked my phone. Uninstalled! Thankyou for your response. I get it, however my limited use doesn't justify the spend. If the idea of creating inescapable ad-loops was to deter us freeloaders, you nailed it! I will continue to recommend Pixlr to my contacts, but only if they intend to pay.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The ads are too intrusive and make this app unusable. It used to be wonderful but now I'm on the hunt for an alternative. Uninstalled.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The startling loud and intrusive ads have ruined this app. I've had to navigate through multiple windows to the point at which I've lost my work. The last ad was some young girl singing about sex and body parts. No more...,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Pop up ad to much.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Just upgraded my phone. Same account. I PURCHASED the app before the subscription service came on the scene. I just went to use it and it is ad full. Why is this. Did I mention I PURCHASED the app. I understand you need to make money but this is not kool. Thank you for the response but now it says I don't have a purchase. Still don't work.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used to be a great app until recently that I haven't been able to save my work. I will try reinstalling but I don't know if I can trust it anymore.,2

I would be happy to make a one time purchase with limited updates but this is not a ""service"" type app. Subtracted 1 star for the lame response from the development team. Read what I wrote, I'm NOT expecting anything for free. It's no longer an issue though, as the app is uninstalled so there is no ad revenue generated from me.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Its a free app, so not much to expect, but besides some filters this app is even surpassed by the infamous Microsoft Paint. And thats kinda disappointing, I can't even make a surface white since there is simply no option for it. Uninstalled",3

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"EDITING, again! Adios Pixlr, I'm leaving you. Our 5+ years have been great but now you've become totally abusive, you're making me watch 2 full adds before I can save my work! Or to pay $12 USD a year! For a basic photo editing app?!! Well there are plenty of fish in the sea. Adi√≥s I'm going fishing somewhere else.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I use to absolutely loved this app for months. Then they came out with the new updates that makes you click 3-4 times to skip/close the ads. They also made the fonts blurry to hell.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used this app for years. Loved it for so many reasons, even though it's limited in its ability to edit superimposed images and blur/blend sections. I understand apps need to make money, but the new feature of forcing users to watch long ads or lose their work is intrusive and frustrating. Surely there's a better way.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"This is still the best free photo editing/art app on my device. Been using it since 2015 and still yet to find one I like better.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Adverts are ridiculous now. 3 or 4 moronic mobile game ads when you try and save an image. Unusable.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Guess I'm deleting this app I've used for forever now due to time consuming ads. Don't have time for them. Edit to their reply: I can't even save a picture without an ad getting in the way. Nor in this time of a worldly shitshow can I afford to pay for a photo app. I'll find another. Thanks for understanding.....,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The whole experience has gone terrible. Nothing is worrying even with latest update. Ads just keep bombarding and you really can't save or edit or preview much.,1

So sad.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This was good before. Recently it compels us to download one game app each and every time we go for editing. Unable to save without downloading new app.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I used to really enjoy the app but now it is impossible to complete a simple edit without extensive adverts that don't allow you to complete any work. Sadly disappointing since it was so good,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used this app for years, but much like everyone else the ads (WITH SOUND) are unbearable, unskippable and I've lost images multiple times when I have eventually got back to my image to try and save it.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"This has been my go to app for years, I even still use it even though some of the commercials can be invasive but they have to make revenue.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app so we will see if it works out.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to love the app, yes that had to change platforms to run on but leaving out the options that made it the best (like adding photos, removing backgrounds, having a history brush) it truly felt like a pocket Photoshop. I miss it :/",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads now take over the phone. Suddenly hardly usable. It is a real shame but I'll find an alternative as I do a lot of photo editing and being caught in an unstoppable ad loop is not acceptable in an age of malware etc. Way to kill a great app.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"I LOVED this app. It was my go-to for everything editing, but recently, the ads have been ridiculous, annoying and a total turn off using this app. Quite disappointed tbh cause I genuinely don't want to replace the app but I might have to now.",2

This will be uninstalled if it continues",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,This has ALWAYS been my #1 go to for photo editing and although I don't mind ads (and fully understand the reasoning behind them) using this app has become beyond frustrating! An ad (and the very same one at that) after everything that I attempt to do (not even finish) is excessive. BTW... I've noticed your response on other reviews saying that this issue has been resolved... I'm going to tell you that as of today it has not been resolved so please don't try to tell me otherwise.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Thank you for resolving a lot of the issues, such as 'blur' and some others with the new update. Also need to thank your team for your prompt and efficient responses to my emails.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Was good. Ads ruined it. I have uninstalled it after years of use and tried other apps. I can now highly recommend ""GridArt"" (I have no affiliation). I don't care if Pixlr say the ads help them maintain it, they are WAY too intrusive and you have to kill the app when the videos pop up, without having done the picture altering that you opened Pixlr for!

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"(edit: trying and liking InShot Inc's ""Polish photo editor Pro"") Pixlr was my go-to editor for many years (2016??), but now that video ads have taken over, I'm going elsewhere. Nothing worse than sitting through 4 wait screens PER AD only to find collages I made are all stretched- not that bugs are a deal breaker for me. However: greedy, annoying, time wasting ads, IN ADDITION to the old ads, ARE! Edit: redone the collages 5 times now with the same bug every time. Actually HAVE to go elsewhere.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"New update bombards you with video ads. This used to be my go-to app. The banner ads were ok, but these full screen video ads with no way to back out are outrageous. Going with Adobe express.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,The last couple months your commercials got out of hands you really think by getting the app stuck from 1 to 3 minutes it is going to make me watch your advertisement? well guess what I will uninstall it. I have Pixlr close to ten years I understand you have to make money but not on my expense,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"this is the best editor i discovered so far. period. it has a lot of features that other companies claim that their application is ""professional"", yet alone how difficult the other editors are, and this app has everything i need for my editing WITH easy usage, i am really happy of this application and would look forward for more updates.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"It's so bad,I want to give it a 0. But that's not possible,so imma give it a 1",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"App has Fullscreen ads that lock the screen, any button only leads to the ad's download link even after waiting for ad to timeout",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Has the App been hijacked by botspammers or something? Now there's a full screen pop up every time the app is opened trying to get you consent to device data sharing.

Specifically, we will use your device data to optimize the gameplay mechanics, application stability, and to show relevant ads. Thank you for playing our game."" How about NO?",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Good to Terrible addpocalypse at its finest Was a great app till they jumped on the band wagon of being bombarded with adds Update your app and turn off the disgusting adds for sakes of not being sell outs,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Jesus CHRIST the ads. I had this app for literally less than 5 minutes, yet I kept getting ad after ad. I couldn't even save the photo I was working on, it was so bad. Very horrible app",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Good,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"For no more updates that is provided you found it necessary on last so called update to add a series of adds during the save process. This app used to be one of my favorites to use, but now, not impressed anymore",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This was my go to for photo editing. Too many ads. Will find have to find another.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"i used to love this app, spent 5+ years using it, have even used this app to draw digital portraits etc for my art business but now it either crashes or when you finish a step it pixilates it instead of just leaving it how it looks i uninstall and reinstall numerous times, it works for about 5 steps then thats it. so sad this was great to use then they had to go and mess with it",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Don't,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I keep trying to edit literally the first picture I wanted to try and I keep getting kicked out of the app. There is no apparent reason for this. I wouldn't recommend, as I cant even edit any pictures on this software without being booted. 1/10",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Been the go to app for as long as I remember, but the recent change in advertising is so intrusive I'm looking for a replacement. What was a simple and efficient process is now a 5 minute wait through ads for spammy, terrible games.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,My favorite apps,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I'm back in,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Adds are absolutely ridiculous... you trying to save a photo then have to wait for 3 adds, you save the photo and one mor add is popping out then it's pushing you to play store to download something you never wanted. No matterhow many times you hit back buttonit won't work... control sad act freaks",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"As soon as the literal 5 minute Wordscapes ad comes up [that you can't get out of] I uninstalled. Sad to see it go, been using Pixlr for years. That ad was rediculously long just to edit a photo. Had me sitting in my car for another 5 mins just to resize a photo that should have taken 5 seconds.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"free.. means free. listen. ""start 3 day free trial"" is not free. ad blocking even the first photo i edit is not free. your at best a liar.. and at worst a scammer... 1 star because i cant give 0 punk",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Unskippable ads. Can't even mute. Moving to something else.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"New ads are way too intrusive and can't be muted. Shame, this was a solid app.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,It's not the adds that drive me crazy...it's the constant app crashing.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The image was ridiculously blurry after saving. All that work to get the image the way I wanted it was completely wasted.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to be good, but now inundated with ads.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Was going to give a 1 star rating , later see a update, it was then sorted and corrected.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used this app for years. I don't mind the occasional ad, but these ads are relentless and annoying and in no way shape or form are they interesting to me. If Pixlr paid for an taegeted ad algorithm, they got ripped off.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,All ads. The ads are made in Photoshop... I wonder why?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"It no longer saves as new photo, which it keeps overwrite the original photo...",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Boo your ads are shite,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Good,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to be my go-to editor, but the ads have been getting more and more obtrusive. For example, some video ads have a (very tiny) x in the corner. And even clicking the x still opened the ad link.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Couldn't do anything with this app . Waste of time,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to be great, now intrusive ads spoil it completely. Can't share to app from photo either.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I just want to be able to do very simple things like cut and paste. This can't do that,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used to be my favourite photo editing app but now it's overrun with adverts. And after the copious adverts finish the app crashes. Unusable.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Easy,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Please stop the ads,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Still having issues with the adverts on this app. Especially the Tick Tok and the Facebook Add. It's really annoying. Yet your team have supposed to of fixed this issue.?,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Uninstalled due to too many over-intrusive and really annoying ads for games I'll never be interested in downloading.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"I used to love this app, but now you have to watch a one minute long video before you can save. I understand you need to make money but these are excessive. I don't mind watching for about 10 seconds, but not a minute. There are plenty of other apps that can replace you, so before you lose more subscribers, hence lose people to watch your ads, you guys need to revisit the idea of running one minute long video ads.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I'm using from last few years.. now after last update in brightness filter, it's very bad. Please revert brightness update.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Always crashing, never can save photos. used to be great. needs bug fixes",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app for year's. Had to uninstall due to aggressive pop-up ads you cannot bypass which then force you to the play store. I have always been happy to pay for an ad free environment, but not a monthly subscription; especially as I only use it for the basic functions. Offer a way to remove the ads without a subscription and I will happily return.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I paid for no ads years ago and now there are (very aggressive) ads and when pressing the 'restore' purchase button it says ‚Äúno purchase to restore‚Äù.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"This used to be my all time favorite app! Now it is HORRIBLE!! The ADS hold you HOSTAGE. Non-stop. One after another, taking up the full screen on Android devices and only after half a minute does a tiny ""x"" appear on the top right. So tiny that I missed it and had to reboot my phone twice!! Disgusting! EDITED: I was pleasantly surprised to receive a very prompt response from Pixlr and I re-downloaded the app to try it out. Unfortunately the ADS bombardment continued. 8 ADS before I could save my changes. I give the app 2 stars this time but it is a far cry from what it used to be. It had reasonable amount of advertising but didn't completely overwhelm the user.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Your new add policy and access to information is rubbish deleting app permanently,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Worst app now just because of adds.. UNINSTALLING.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Not sure why this was put on the list with pixart it's free for a reason terrible boring,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,bad,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Good application,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Many times already my meticulous photo edits have been lost right as I'm about to save them. I believe its due to a bug that initiates the ad that play before saving a file, its causing the app to crash and not save any changes. Since I can't save my work, I will be uninstalling this and looking for a suitable replacement app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Issue with saving pictures! Excellent photo editor on my old mobile phone, a 4 1/2 year old Lenovo P2 and I do not have any issues saving edited pictures. Sadly on my Asus tablet it gets stuck when trying to save a picture and the only option is to close the app and lose any work. A real pity as this is a very good app for basic editing on a mobile device and I especially like the ability to erase selective parts of any edits! Update, stupid adverts made App unusable. Deleted!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Great! I have been using it for the past 5yrs.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Went from easily the best photo editing app to by far the worst piece of trash app on the marketplace. Insane that devs would put so much effort into destroying their own app. Crashes every five seconds now and tons of long ads.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Super easy to use. Limited font options, though.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Very limited all about selfies bye,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"I've been using this app for a while, but after using other programs this one just doesn't seem to be able to keep up. There are no layers, so editing text is not possible, the default text is white serif, not changeable, moving objects on screen requires two fingers, as one finger will rotate instead. One finger can move objects, but it has a habit of instead roatating by an indiscernible amount, without a guarantee that it will lock back into the correct orientation.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Pixler has been such a great app I've used a long time for a non-profit international organization that helps people in which I volunteer. It was perfect. Now the adds interfere with my work. The font selection isn't as good as it used to be either. I'm really disappointed. It was a 4 star app, now its a 1 star.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Ooopp,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,So I can't lighten and darken parts of a pic anymore after updating my phone .over all I love this app and use it daily. Plz fix thank you,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It keeps error and closing the app I hope you fix it..,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads are blocking the program. Especially the TicTok ones. This is useless any more,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"After the update, the fonts that I normally use have vanished.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Can't figure out how to add an image. Uninstalled.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Best of the best .,..",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It sucks...! With the new update we cant use the brightness brush tool. It itcreases the whole brightness automatically. Please corrrect this asap. This is the perfect photo editor that i have ever seen and need it back. Thanks.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"This is my main editing app, I loved it for the longest time but now I can barely go 1 minute without those annoying pop up ads. I was fine with the other ads being shown because they don't interrupt the flow but when they pop up constantly and you gotta wait 10/15 seconds or so I would pay to remove ads but I feel like paying a subscription for a mobile editing app isn't worth it - just have it a one time purchase",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,üëéüëéüëé,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Ouch. Still a good app, but unless you've paid, their new ads block you from finishing a project unless you download Facebook. Not something I'm interested in doing, at all. Uninstalled.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Roshan,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The blur option doesn't work. It keeps blurring the whole photo even if I click line or center. That was the best feature on there. Please fix!,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Nice app,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"The latest update solved the share ability, the apps good, not sure why the low ratings... (arm64, Android 12)",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"In the last few months the app just does not work. I Cannot save the photos, or even use all the features that I could before. Would not recommend atm, although I used it for years. :(",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Bad the only bad thing about this is that when u try to make text it's getting so annoying.also the pixelated effect is way to much i put it at 1 percent and u still can't see it.When i go to my computer it's so much better can u please change it and make it look just like the pc version? Thank you,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Please add a shadow for the font I need it for bright pictures,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,This is the best app,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,This used to be my favorite app. I used it for designing and am still trying to. But you have to remember to turn off wifi before you save your finished pattern or you will be subjected to adds for facebook ( which I hate) and other platforms. Also some of my favorite fonts have completely gone. It used to be absolutely my favorite and I was really used to it... actually I am kinda gutted that its become so obnoxious. üôÑ,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,FONTS STILL OT FIXED 90 DAYS LATER. ARE YOU GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COMPLAINT?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"The amount of adverts that are suddenly popping up when using this app is ridiculous, I'm thinking of going over to a different editing app because of the adverts.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Amazing,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"Pefect app.I m using for lastfive years.. It is also suugested to add pic object crop tools i.e. human, birds, animals etc. any objects. Really very usefull & perfect to compose, edit, add stickers, unwanted removal tools are so friendly.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"very bad, too many ads come up, and don't allow me to save my photos after a laborious editing... very sad n pethatic , please don't install this app, UNSKIPPABLE ADS",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It is too hard to place a text letter...,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Paid for the subscription yet I can't access it. Can't log in, can't restore, Sick of all the ads when I go to save photo's. Especially since paying to use it. Used to love this app. Not paying for pro again since I've wasted money on something that doesn't even work. Used to be great! Sad it's gotten to be such a mess.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Cropped images saved even on max settings have blurry text. Have used the app on iOS for years and it doesn't have the same issue that side. Was lucky enough to buy it there before the rent-to-use only (with no option to buy) era began,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Been one of my favorites for years but now I can't get a single photo done because it keeps crashing. Please fix this!,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Very slow to save. This is the second time it's switched to ""original"" after I've spent a lot of time editing. There's no explanation. Even though it has the undo buttons showing, once it says ""original"" the undo and redo buttons have no effect. Uninstall.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,WHAT A RIP OFF! This is what happens when you pay for premium access!!!!! The sticker containing the golden crown and golden stars and starbursts no longer exists!!! And you can't choose the size you save to.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've been using this app for years, but your ads are ridiculous now. There's so many, and you can't just skip them easily anymore. I just had 6 ads while trying to edit one image. I understand the need to earn money, but this is desperate. You're trying to force people to pay for a subscription by making their experience unbearable. I think I'll just find a new app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"This is my go to app for the more simple pic and photo editing jobs such as zoom, crop, rotate, add text. It is quick to open and respond, and just as quick to convert and save changes to your edited pic in whatever format you've chosen. Easiest five stars I've ever given an app üôÇ thank you @pixlr",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Bakwas .,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,very easy opareting pixlr,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This update killed this app. Maximum size reduced. I cannot open big pictures from gallery in Pixlr. And too many ads. Finally uninstalling after 9 years,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Came to the app store to uninstall and reinstall the app, and got detoured by the reviews. I also have used this app for years, but the pop up ads that won't close, on top of them just being so loud and abrupt, killed it for me. I'll spend money on ad-free software somewhere else after that nonsense.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Images are no longer saved. And to the developers, no, they're not saved in any photo albums. They are nowhere on my phone. Update: I attempted to uninstall and reinstall per developer suggestion to no avail. There are absolutely zero saved files on my phone, despite the app stating that the image is saved. This is unfortunate for the developers, since I will be uninstalling permanently.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Pixlr was my go to app for editing photos for many years, but it was brutally and quite suddenly made almost unusable overnight by an update with such intrusive ads. I get how e-commerce works and have other apps that run with ads, but this is just silly and has literally broke the program.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"What's with the endless ads? I understand that ads come with a free app, but endless time of being able to save edited image is bs!",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Sadly a once great app has become basically unusable recently - it's now blocked by really annoying intrusive video ads, so obstructive it's almost impossible to do any photo editing, and they even divert you to Google play to try and get you to install apps not even vaguely related. Gutted. I contacted the developer, who said I needed to subscribe to get rid of these bugging ads - well, I suggest they stop calling it a Free Photo Editor now, because it isn't.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Was the best now video ads. Delete!,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Not digging the move to subscriptions - this kinda sucks as I've already dropped money for the full paid ""pro"" version some time ago and have used this app quite a bit. Now I'm getting an ad for another app on the home screen. Some of the filters and overlays are still useful to me but this app has been been slowly going downhill for a while - there's been a lot of tinkering with subscriptions and paid content but no new features or real improvements.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,It's a wonderful app and super easy to use when you get the hang of it. I definitely recommend getting it!,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Restricted the app access to wi-fi and mobile networks so now I can save my pics without obnoxious ads, just like in good old days (yesterday).",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I had been using this app for years. Recent update was pathetic. Added so many ads. I uninstalled now and will never use this app... It sucks üòû,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,May i request or suggest that if it is possible to have an attachment (picture) function that can be posted on the picture being edited.,3

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I updated app today and after that I can not open photos from my gallery with Pixlr. Before I did update it was working well.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This was a favorite app for YEARS and has been ruined recently. Unclosable popup ads are the last straw.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Used to be good, now full of adverts, awful! And to get rid of the adverts a subscription is needed. I hate subscriptions. Better pay once and be done.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,horrible app. Cant adjust anything at all and you get 30 second apps between using anything. Dont even waste your time,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I have seen this app from becoming best to worst. Lots and lots of issues. Irritating adv., low performance and feature.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Hi to the developers. Firstly I thank you for this super app. BUT now after the update we can't do anything on it anymore. WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THIS ??? It was PERFECT BEFORE and now its all one big mess and all users won't be able to use it. Guess you guys got bored and messed it up. Please üôè put it back to how it was before Thnx,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,After using for a few weeks it works the best of any photo editing program for Android.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I would have given a 'zero' star review if I could... thanks for the latest update and changes that saw you bombard me with 4 ads sequentially, without any choice to exit your app.. uninstalling..",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Was a great app , for years . Now whatever adds they use make it unbearable. Deleted",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"This used to be my favorite editing app but it just doesn't work anymore. Several feature appear to work, but when I save the changes it edits the entire image without any changes I made. For instance, the brightness/darkness brush looks like it works, where I brush. When I'm finished with that tool, the image is either entirely brightened or darkened rather than just being how it was edited. This isn't the only tool with that problem. Most of these tools don't work on the website.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Pixlr.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,It does not ask you for money nor make you keep watching ads every time you do one edit or cut like PicsArt,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This app used to be great before they recently filled it with ads. Can't even save a pic without being bombarded with them. What a joke.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The worst ADS ever, you are forced into watching long no way to end ADS that closing the app will not even stop. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH 2022 PIXLR This WAS a great app but now it is useless!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"It is a great editor app but my suggestion is can you add chroma key for easy background erasing? I have blue and green screen, I just want to remove it easily by selecting the color to erase.",4

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"To be honest I absolutely love this app for edits.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The app is about as difficult to work with as most mobile photo editors, but the worst aspect here is the video ads. You're sitting at your desk at work trying to make a couple quick edits to a listing for fb, when BOOM, an unclosable video ad launches at full tilt, ear blasting volume. I don't need that on my phone. Be less intrusive shovelware and I might find you more tolerable.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I have been using this app for about 4 years, it is great.",5

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,5 star reviews for YEARS but Pixlr is getting greedy and is making it impossible to use the app without an overpriced subscription.

Adobe aside, Snapseed offers all professional functions in an easy way without ads... Polish again wins over Pixlr by having Remove tool. Pixlr Heal tool is horrendous, especially in complex spots... While Pixlr is good at desktop, then it fails against, say, GIMP.... I don't know what to say but for the fine tuning of photos Pixlr is not up to the task.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"I want to preface this by saying that I have used this app for over a year now, and plan to continue doing so. I recommend anyone looking for a free image editing software to try this one. This comes with an important caveat however- this app will randomly send you back to the homescreen or crash at very inopportune times, so I recommend saving multiple times if your work and time are valuable to you.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I give it 2 stars cause this app used to be really fun and useful. I've had this app for a long time now and have seen many changes.

That would be a useful feature for us, since all this images only requires to enhance a certain similar aspect for all of them and it is a burden to edit it 1 by 1.

For example, some of my photos are split in half by a very thin line horizontally, or blocks of black appear on random spots. These bugs appear randomly, and sometimes you need to save the file multiple times for them to dissappear. Please fix <3",4

Bye To reply to your comment: I understand why you do ads and didn't mind them prior. It's the timing that they pop up! Thank you,1

Don't be so greedy; maybe users would continue to use your product, thus making you money. You don't make money if you chase all your users away with ridiculously intrusive ads.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Like others, I've been using this app for years and now all of a sudden they want you to pay for an exorbitant subscription (there's better editors if I'm going to pay, btw). They say you can continue to use it for free if you're connected to the internet (presumably so they can generate revenue through ads), but it's glitchy because it says you need to connect to the internet even when you're already connected.

For some reason it takes ages to save an image. I can do a collage in roughly the same time it takes to save it... At least it's saving now though. Background removal/replacement would be good if that can be included soon",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Haven't used it,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Waste of time,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Don't deserve 5 stars anymore.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Used to be reliable. Now It crashes when uploading pics. Useless. Any suggestions?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Unable to use this app offline. Seems arrogant to demand customers sign in. I don't like that the app is downloading every time I use it either. Will find something less demanding of customers and more appreciative of their patronage.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Latest update ruined it. Full of glitches now. Just shuts down photo editing while adding text.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Lots of filters, frame options and editing tools",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,This app was my favorite of all time but now I m unable to download any package or features....that's why only 2 stars,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The fall of a great app! Next level greed from the developers.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Was a great app and used it for years. Intrusive adds, can't use it offline anymore and why? Because greed took over the creator. If there was one flat rate purchase instead of a dumb subscription, sure I'd probably get it but I'm not about subscription based apps.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I don't see the need to have net access to edit pics once in a while. It was good as it was before.,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Was such a good app. Now you have to pay for it.,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Love this app. BUT it leaves so much on my tablet I have to clean it (2270 just from one of the features) I have to clean it after every time I use it and I use it every day. But great app.,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used this photo editor for years and it used to be a lot better - then they screwed it up with way too many ads, and of course, like many companies inevitably do, they made some of the app features paid. It's also become significantly slower and buggier, has crashed on me multiple times and lags like all hell. I'm actually really annoyed that a once great app has gone so down hill. Fix it up, guys, whatever you're doing recently sucks BIG TIME compared to what your app used to be.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This WAS an excellent photo editor app. Easy to use, easy to navigate. I loved it. But in August 2020 they changed how the ads work on the site. You have to click through countless ads to get anything done. And they started charging fees to use their functions. I deleted the app because the ads make it unusable.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,This is a fantastic app,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Have been using this app for years, now all of a sudden I have to pay a sub to use it??? Disappointed to say the least and now deleted.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,It's irritating. Many times collage image doesn't get save.,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Ad at mid of usage really sucks. Also, the app is stammering after your Ad get ends. So I've uninstalled Pixlr. Cheers!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Was great until the app started hijacking my gallery and loading over 2100 artsy thumbnails to it EVERY TIME I edited a photo. I'd go through and delete allllll those art thumbnails...and the very next time I used Pixlr it would do it again. About to delete all the garbage for the 11th time, and deleting the app off my phone. Not sure what you changed, but you lost a customer.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,nice,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Okay that good,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I used to use this all the time. Now it doesn't allow offline use without monthly payment. Also it won't work even with internet for some reason. I uninstalled immediately and now I'm looking for a different app. Don't waste your time with this one,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"What sucks about this app when an ad plays it deletes everything, it just vanishes, this has happened on multiple occasions and the fact that i love editing and design means a lot to me with my work its heart breaking every time it dissapears its a good editing app when you know how to use it but the risk of your work dissapearing is not worth it.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Dropped to one star over mutiple updatesfrom four because there is no reason given for updating. I won't update a one star pig in a poke app. Developers need to indicate What's New every time they post an update even if it is just that they found and fixed bugs or optimized code. Without an indicated change, a user has no motivation to update (or continue to use) an app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"It says I'm offline so I cannot use the app because I'm not subscribed, but I am connected to a WiFi network ‚Äì this really upsets me. It happens all the time, I also cannot open the app using 4G. I usually just switch to another app then. I expect to soon find a suitable alternative that does allow offline use & delete this one. I use Snapseed alongside Pixlr, but I like the filters here. Also, it seems that the image quality is reduced significantly when having edited and then saving the image.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I purchased a lifetime subscription to not have ads. I come to the mobile site to realize I can't log in & have to UPGRADE TO MONTHLY to NOT have ads? WHAT??? I have to pay through Google for the premium. I HAVE the PREMIUM! This is CRAZY!,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Wont let you edit photos without wifi and watching ads,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Previous version was good to use. But now It is becoming worse. After update this is demanding for subscription. It is no longer available for free use with limitations. Now it is completely paid app. I think that I am loosing my interest with this app. A long time ago it was my favorite app. But now it is started irritating me and within a week I will shift my mind on another app for my daily work.,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to be great but these ads that pop up, usually when you're editing have ruined it.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I don't mind ads, Devs got to earn. But constant ads that actually stop me from saving or doing anything mean I'm deleting this and using Snapseed instead. Shame. Still a good app, just the ad experience has ruined it",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"2020 review: Pixlr you were the one. The one app that I would suggest to everyone. Now I can't even save my work due to the ads glitch (or is it?) which only allows me go save after 3-4 ads. Sure, premium product ""must"" be paid but this is just sad. Product managers, choose your path and stick to it. Pixlr is dying. Farewell old friend. 2013 review: The amazing number of effects, edition and the easiest way to work your image makes this one of the best apps that I've experienced. And its free!",5

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,I previously loved this app but now every time I try to export an image I'm not able to do so as ads pop up right after closing the previous ad. Dissaponting.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The app was very good for photo alteration, now there are adds that immediately force open a split second after you close it and attempt to save what you have worked on. This causes you to click on the intrusive add instantly. This is a very sneaky way to for this app to get paid by advertisers, however very frustrating for the user of the app. Thumbs down to the new way of doing things.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,good once. now it deletes your progress unless you subscribe to a monthly service .,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It was annoying.. too much ad popping when i am about to save the edit. I can't even save it. Ads won't stop coming out.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Doesn't preserve the original photo's Exif data which makes it unusable for me. Other photo editing apps preserve the original date taken so it's certainly possible. Also just seems to be getting progressively worse in general so have switched to Photoshop Express which is miles better!,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Useless, constantly bombarded with ads in the middle of trying to save, clunky brush tools. Go somewhere else",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to love this app, but now it's gotten so buggy and full of ads that it's just not worth keeping. Plus now if you're not online then it demands a subscription (which requires internet access) or it closes the image without any chance of saving the progress. I'm sad that I had to uninstall it, but it's no longer that glorious app that I used to recommend. RIP Pixlr",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I am confusion. Do I have to pay in order to save files? If so, it would have been nice to let me know that instead of have me searching every crevice of my Galaxy for the last hour like I did something wrong. Jesus don't like evil-doers.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I would of paid a one off price years ago for this very handy app because it was my go-to editor, there are now way better and free photo apps available without all the hassle this brings. It's not a top photo editor so why all new money grabbing and offline BS. You have got to big for your boots. I don't use this version more than once a week used to be every day. üòû",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Obtrusive adverts. Can no longer use this app when out in the wilds due to needing online access at all time to ram adverts down you throat at any given moment. Use to be my goto app... Now I'll use something less obstructive and obtuse!,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,My go to photo editor,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,As many comments before..it used to be good but now unable to use with all this pop ups and blockages,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Your app went from 5 stars to 1 star overnight. Been using your app since it came out and I have to say that I am not massively disappointed in it all. The subtle advertising was fine but now it's completely ruined the experience. Can't believe I Will be uninstalling the app after nearly 10years.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Tried to save a picture and received at least five ads in a row before receiving an error message, which I couldn't read because there came yet another ad. Is this for real? It used to be one of the best apps in the store.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ads now spoil this software to the point it unusable.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"My original 5 Star review is still here from 5 years ago. Now I've edited it to 1 Star because of how bad the app has become. In order to save a edit, now you have to watch an Ad? Let's not forget a few times it has crashed when watching an Ad. This app was once my favorite, with the best filters and simple editing tools. Sadly it's been overrun by Ads. *Sad face*",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I really don't know what happened here. This was my first ever editing app I used and I have been using it for small projects since that one summer many years ago. But now, oh hoho, stuff hit the fan. At first, it was the extra stickers only premium members could use. Fine, stuff like that isn't new. But the new adds. I have tried to save my stuff but now I'm getting bombarded with adds, after adds. The app glitches due to the adds I keep getting, even if I skip them. It was fun to use.. WAS.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Impossible to use. Managed to edit a photo even though most of the features have been removed for non payers, tried to save it, and ad after ad flicked across the box I needed to tick and blacked it out so I couldn't save anything. It was literally one ad per second. Couldn't do a thing with it.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"This was the ""go to"" app for photo editing, until the recent update... it has become absolutely unusable because of the pushy adverts! They are so pushy, that once you click on the ""X"" to close an ad and select something in the app, a new advert pops up and so on and so on. This forces you to stop using it abandon whatever you were doing. Photoshop Express is much better with more options and NO adverts!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,The app has great benefits but you cannot use it offline and you still need to pay if you got online 1 time and it can't add another photo to insert it to another and I'm giving this 2 stars and I'm not recommending this app. Hope you fix this problem Developer. I'm not forcing coz I can delete this anytime anywhere,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I love the different filters i can use on this app, but since the new update, i am no longer a fan. Once a pleasure to use, sadly no longer the case. Trying to save an image and cancelling the exact same advert repeatedly has made me change my review from 5 to 1 star. I get that you must be put ads in, it's a business after all, but if i have to go through all that trouble for one image to save, it's simply no longer worth it.",1

Not worth bothering about now, though uninstalled and replaced with an old version that isn't so bad, v3.4.29. But it will be going shortly. Like most developers, have got greedy and $$$ only motivation. Currently using a lot of Simple Mobile Tools apps, like Simple Gallery - and Google's Snapseed",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,The app just became a cash grab and distroyed the used base,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used to free, requires subscription now, don't know why it is labelled as ""free"".",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Used to be pretty good. Now I can't save and it just loops to ads instead. And honestly, the UI is clunky. Can't undo and redo anything. It's annoying and time consuming.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"All good for last year untill last update.. adds keep popping up stopping you to use filters or to save the image, you closethem and next second your screen turns black again. Out of order..!!!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used pixlr for years with no problem. Now I can't download an image because I'm being blocked by ads. Uninstalling.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This is the worse update. Saved Image quality is very low.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I've used Pixlr for many years, and always reccomend others to do so too. However the ads have recently became very intrusive, so much so I have to click them off upto 5 times during the saving image process. I guess it's time to try and find another photo editing app unfortunately.",2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Used this app for years, was great until the last few days and now ads have made the app unusable even with basic functions. See you Pixlr.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Using ths app since 5 years i love it.. but recently it is turned into payeble i think . So i coundnt use it.. plzzzzz enable ths app free,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Since you offer a pay to use without ads service you've ruined this app with intrusive adds that don't allow the app to function as before, total sell out to the ad men!!!!! Well played, will be deleting app for one without ads or a few to remove them!!! Advertising is like a mafia extortion racket!!!!!!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I would've of put a 5 star rating. I been using the app from the moment it came out and loved it. I even advised it to people to download it. But very recently the app kept crashing and now will not even open up! On my S6 Samsung. Which has left me feeling disappointed. Speically I think it is way better than photoshop. Further to say that the new way the advert now take over the whole screen and rarely puts the X to remove it to be able to save the photo. This will put more people off the app.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I pay my phone bill every month and yet this application continues to deny my use because I don't (also) have wifi. Very unfair.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"This is one of the best apps for editing pics so far. It has nice fonts , filters , abstract, stickers etc.",5

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Until issues are fixed: USE SNAPSEED! PIXLR's been my go-to mobile editor. I can turn smart phone photos into professional looking pieces of art. Hell, I've even managed to sell a photo. Now the app is next to unusable. I know 123RF needs to get paid, however the ads literally kill the app. The second an ad is closed, the menu options become invisible, making it impossible to edit a photo. Also, the app cannot be used offline unless you subscribe. Seriously?! An amazing app has just died.",1

And now they've got it set that you have to pay for a subscription if you aren't connected to wifi. Just what the heck kind of predatory bullcrap is that.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Recommended for more than double dozen peoples myself. Used to be the best. Eventually they were putting more and more ads, which i don't mind as they were revenue for the app makers.But later become targeted ones, still adjusted thinking it's everywhere in this age.

(Whoever made this decision is a company killer)",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Just a reminder here U can be against Pixlr move to put pop-up delay ads after editing. So download all the free filters when in editing mode, then BLOCK ""background data"" on this app (if your phone is on Android 10, or already have this option on older android version). You'll still get pop-up but video ad doesn't appear, just unstable pic ad that can be exit in no time. However, I found out the subscription isn't expensive tho.

I have had this app for several years as a trusted app for photo edits. I was fine with the ads as they were because they have to make money somehow. I don't edit enough to warrant a paid app, but now I may just find another app and pay for it in spite. Bad move Pixlr.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Why the hell do you need Internet to use this app? It's forcing users to subscribe to a monthly or annual fee.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Absolute trash. Sure you can edit photos and do some fancy tricks. . . . .but if you leave the app for a few minutes or your phone locks itself after a couple seconds automatically, and you go back into the app, you lose ALL your progress and have to start from scratch.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,This app is very good for photo edits. But nowadays it is not working. Everytime it is asking to connect to internet though it is connected to internet. Offline it doesnot work. Looks like developer wants to make it paid app.,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Worst app dont waste ur tym,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I can't use it anymore, it's asking me for subscription and it boots me out to menu when I try to exit it.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Was good until it started demanding online access aka no offline access for free version. The worse thing is that the app does not even recognise that IS in fact online,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"It's a nice editor, but I don't recommend it. It compresses images before loading them into the editor and happens regardless of image format. It's barely noticeable on small images, but if you take a large image and crop it a few times you will see what I mean. The cropping feature is a bit broken. E.g. the square crop isn't always exactly 1:1, instead of 1080x1080 it's 1080x1079. Don't use this app for large images. Giving it a one star until they fix these issues.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,Used to be a great app. Not anymore. It has in app store purchases and ads. But now they added that you have to be connect online to use the app. A stupid added new restriction. My phone says has full strength data and wifi and it won't let me connect.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Pixlr WAS my MUST-HAVE photo editing app, UNTIL they began charging money this past month in order to use it. SO disappointed, and so is my husband who's been using Pixlr even longer than I have.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Ive been using this app for a long time. But now i cant do anything offline without a paid subscription. If yall make most of your money off ads then remove this.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Hands down the best photo editing app I've ever used on my phone. And it's free. So many options. So many preset boarders, styles, filters. I've used it for years and have become quite adept with it. One issue I have is when erasing part of a filter or layer over the picture, you can't undo your last stroke if you messed up, you have to start all over again and this can be very annoying if I have been working on it for a while. Other than a few minors issues like that, this is an amazing app.",5

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Just had to update my rating (from 2 years ago) as the ads have become disruptive. And the offline subscription policy is a disaster. What happens when your signal or wi-fi drops? You cannot use the app! Disappointing,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Good up until it neuters itself by forcing a paywall. Not actually free.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"Used to be incredible! I've been using it for years, but the update that brought in video ads needs to be fixed.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Like all these other reviews I'm seeing, I LOVED this app and used it all the time. Ads made it annoying, and paywall made it unusable.

Due to the changes- intolerable ads, unease of use, offline use- I will not be purchasing the paid version, nor using the free version. Uninstalling an app that used to be a staple on my phone. I would consider coming back if improvements are made. Very unfortunate, this was once a really useful, creative tool.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"The ads pop up and interrupt constantly and there are instances when one ad pops up, you close it and another immediately opens. This is way to interruptive. I used this app for like a year on my old phone, never updated the app now that i installed it on my new phone all i see is constant ads. I would understand if you get a pop up ad when you open the app and then banner ads while using the app, but this developers implementation is just trying to cash in and piss off existing users.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I used to use this app so much! Don't do edits that much now, but starting with this one was great. Don't know how it is now but it still has a special place in my heart.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Wow, I've been using this app very often for years as my number one go to photo editing app and now I have to have an active subscription and pay money to use it? You guys really suck. Uninstalling for the foreseeable future.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Pretty good. Works 4 me. Use it 4 clients to show B4 & After Works.,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Paid a one time fee to have ads removed and after taking the money they change the payment model saying it's now subscription based. What about the one time fee paid for ad removal?,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,What does this do that literally any other photo app on your phone doesn't already do? Nothing except ads to pay these guys.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Now full screen video ads you can't skip,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,One of the best photo editing app in Google play store,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,When did Pixlr start showing pop up ads? I respect that this app has to make money somehow but jeez it's turning me off from it.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"As has been mentioned, this app WAS amazing but with recently added update that apparently triggers a pop up ad with every function you try to use, i will be uninstalling the app as im sure many more will as well.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Amazing!,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Imagine downloading this app and it takes so long because your internet is slow and upon using it, you find out it requires an internet connection, which you have. But your connection is slow and this app thinks you're not online even though you are.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,So many adds. Wooowwwwww like a bomb ads,5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"Two months ago, I would've given this 4 stars. But now I can barely give 2 stars. Whenever I use t/ DOUBLE EXPLOSURE option, the text is blurred & unreadable, even when the original post is fine. When I use the TEXT option, Cut & Paste and/or Type... the final product is always blurred & not fit to post. I've restarted my Android phone, and deleted & reloaded the app. None of this worked. I've encountered issues w/ the blurring before, but now it's everytime I use the App.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,I have loved this app for years! Then today all of the sudden it won't let me edit pictures without paying for a subscription!! Every time I open it.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"So F***ing annoying how suddenly this app has pop-up ads every time you try to tap a button... also this used to be a totally free app, until recently when the app designers started only putting out new overlays that cost money.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"I am highly disappointed, I've been using this app for over 5 years for free to edit my photo for my media purposes only to open the app to go edit some photos to be continuously spammed with ads ever 15 seconds when not using a tool, then later to have a MUST subscription box pop up to get rid of the ads and for me to continue using the app for $14.99 a month!? And if you choose to press the ""X"" the app doesn't let you continue and closes itself...I'm quite upset and hope this can be resolved.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Use to be great, ruined like 99% of all the other apps. Will be removing from my phone.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"I've been using this for years, even after they added the obnoxious ads. Right up until recently when this app became subscription only.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"30 second add wall after editing each picture I think not. Removed, I'll use another app.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,WOW... IVE BEEN USING THIS APP FOR YEARS I MEAN YEARS EVERYDAY.. ALL OF A SUDDEN IM FORCED TO PAY IF I WANNA CONTINUE ... AND TO MAKE IT WORSE ITS A DAMN SUB.. WOW SAD.. JUST SAD... THIS IS WHY YOULL EVENTUALLY LOSE RESPECT AND USERS... THIS IS DISQUSTING‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used it for years. Now i can't use a feature because it's buried in ads... subscriptions are a no-go. Bye,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,This app has a glitch in the gallery. I use the older Android gallery app. It creates an entire directory of random pictures when I use it. Then I need to delete them. It's super annoying.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,Good app,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"New, full screen, 30 second ads. I'll find an alternative.",5
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"OK, giving them another chance. Still a good app. The annual subscription is reasonable if you use the app frequently. ----- I used to love this app. Used it multiple times a day. Even paid to remove the ads. But now, they want me to pay for every page of filters & overlays - ones that used to be free.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Was a pixlr user for years. Uninstalled due to recent update. Ads constantly pop up during use locking the app and requiring the user to watch 30 second ads rendering the app useless for what i used it for : quick photo editing. Unfortunately I had to Switch to something easier to use. Thanks for the prior years.,2
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This used to be the best app on the market imo. I recommended it to everyone for years. Now it is complete garbage. There are so many ads you can't do anything. 30 seconds of ads every 10 seconds! Don't bother with this trash app.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This is the furthest thing from free. Once you select your photos you immediately have to purchase a subscription. Had this for quite a few years but now looking for an alternative.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Ok,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"I use this app for more than I expected. Most of the time I use it to mildly improve pics. It's a keeper. But I find the doodle feature difficult to use neatly. I feel like I can never make clean lines and the size isn't small enough. Sometimes I want to cleanly write a word on an image but it feels like I'm doing it with a spray can of paint. Unfortunately, I give up a lot.",3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"First thing I saw in the app is ad. Ignored and clicked next , then another ad for 30 sec. So uninstalled. Thanks for the wonderful ad experience üòä",1

I'm really bummed about that. thanks.",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,Create a pollen all some of the filters might be a little too much but I do like the tools at that they have given you an order to I'll see your pictures and whichever way you desire,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,2,"App is great til i can't use it anymore, even the basic editing, unless i subscribe. Sad!",1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,This app is unusable now. It won't take me to the page to save anything. It goes back to the work page every time when you close the advertisement. Anytime you try to save it only plays an advertisement but doesn't allow you to save your work. I lost a lot of effort this morning because I couldn't save it.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Saves photos in low quality, used to be completely free, not worth paying for. After a few years of use, it's downgraded immensely, will be uninstalling and looking elsewhere.",2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"Use to love this app but it fell off a cliff after their moneygrubbing update. When you lose internet connection for a split second a notication pops up saying you must pay for the full version to use the app offline.

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,"My once ""Go to"" app for pic editing is now a Zero Stars kinda deal. Wow, you guys sure know how to completely ruin User Experience. The ads went from being tolerable to ridiculously obnoxious in one update. The app is barely usable, barely. And, here's a kicker, the ads don't even work! Furthermore, your only hope of removing them is... a subscription?! Major nosedive. I've been a major fan for over 2 years, I've even bought little extras here and there. I am bitterly disappointed.",1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,4,"This was a very good beginner app, the tools were easy to find and to use. The app doesn't really make the photos clearer, but the effects it uses are really cool. The fonts in this app are much better than the gallery or photoshop on your phone or tablet. I would recommend using photoshop first, then if you want text edit the edited version in Pixlr.",4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Too many ads. Didn't used to be this many ads. I miss 12 hours ago when there weren't so many ads. Uninstalling.,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,I have used this app for years and years. My only complaint would be the new filters. I'd like to use them without having to buy them. Like have some kind of way you could earn them by watching ads or sharing content. Something like that. Other wise its perfect!,4
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,Used to be great until last update. Now there are SO many ads it's completely unusable. Ads pop up every 30 seconds and I'm required to watch the same 25 second ad EVERY time before I can save my edits?! I don't think so. You got too greedy. Buh bye.,1

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Its good.but lacks some of the editing tools as do most on Google play,3
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,1,It's not like the video at all,1
Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,Ok for basic editing but fails terribly with collage. It is the size problem with this app. You can make smaller but impossible to make larger in many occasions. Meaning add collage of 4 text screenshots and you end up having something utterly weird. I prefer full amount of pixels *at first* and then reducing later. Prefer having full content instead of letters on the middle. Did something like this app around 1987 with X10. Seems like quite stagnated world.... (my draw util was better).,2

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,5,"Great app. Was looking for a quick replacement for Photoshop and found my self over the past few months constantly headed to this app instead. Very 'filter' based when it comes to customizations or manipulations but these days.. a lot of photo edits are capturing realism with few color enhancements. Love the duplicate layers option. In the future, I would like to see more control over the layers. That would nearly knock me away from Photoshop all together.",4

Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor,Unknown,3,"ixlr is great Absolutely The most irritating thing I've come across these last 2 updates is that i can't see all changed as they are! ie: Writing text is fine but i can't see the level of fade i set it at, while the app is open i only get the option to see the text 100% or 0% No in between. That goes for color changing as well, i will work hard on a piece and i think its perfect! After i save it i check my photo folder and the pictures colors are not as the app showed me.
