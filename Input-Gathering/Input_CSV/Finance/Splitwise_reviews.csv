"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Since changes to the free version, it makes no sense having this app anymore. Uninstalling now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love split wise. Now it forces daily expense limits and has an annoying 10 second split wise pro ad for each expense you add. Way to kill a great app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do this app needs SSN and other details if financial account to be linked"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the app sucks. it's buggy. it keeps opening up even if I do not want it to."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be good when it was free. Now transactions are limited. Just use Settle Up. It's free and it's better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was correct, got useless..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 entries per day in free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app decided to text any contact I added to a cost without permission randomly from some random number. My friends then proceeded to text me that something was spamming my name asking for money. This is not ok. Do not install this app. I will not recommend to anyone in the future and will actively discourage it's use when it comes up from someone else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"everytime asking for pro version. Ridiculous. Don't use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for when you have groups away together. keeps things simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the whole user experience with expenses entry limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"See it is only allowing to add maximum 3 bills/expenses.that is not enough you know.you can make it more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too many bugs, the app many times doesn't show whom do we owe how much to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy scum!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The restrictions placed on the free version are really unfair, especially when they have multiple competitors offering the same basic features for free. Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely loving the app. So easy to split payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for big groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very unique and authentic money splitting app for teenagers,youngsters,elders, and for people of all ages. The simplify feature is really awesome, as it calculated the expenses amongst friends themselves instead of you doing all the effort."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable unless you pay $5 per month per user! Extremely limiting free version. Use free open source alternative Spliit (web and web installed app)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limitations on adding expense just to but the subscription is unreasonable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removed from the phone after releasing the paywal. Bye bye Splitwise, hello Splidt"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When do we use this app, occasionally when we go on a trip. Now you have made this app useless for free version. To pay and buy we don't use it daily. Good bye split wise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This was such a convenient app while travelling with friends! Very easy to use. Loved it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Group paying with no pain"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I love capitalism."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Everyone should use this but it should be free of cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Useful app. Would be 5 stars if the ""Itemized split"" from the web app was available on Android."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very convenient!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This time around didn't work, everything was wrong. We had to download another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great. Now they are just greedy for monthly subscription and allow only 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"extremely handy for managing expenses for separate couples with kids; seamless, hassle free and most importantly removes direct communication and points of conflict related to money management, even for amicable situations like mine. thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly. More features needed. You cannot see the overall share of each person in group. Also payments are not simplified enough. Also there is no option to edit names once you create group. If some expense is deleted, that also is wrongly considered in your share. Many defects in application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group travel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only works for USA"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy app management to put restrictions on the free version. Going to uninstall soon. Hope a competitor comes along and makes Greedy Splitwise obsolete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cheap layout and limited functions. Really annoying if you're on the free version. You have to watch an ad every time to add a new expense and now they've even put a limit on the amount of expenses you can add per day! Just get Splitser, it does the same thing but better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, now if you don't pay the Pro version, you can't do much. You have a limit of 3 expenses per day, and even have adds you have to watch and wait before entering each expense..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In one simple sentence. GREEDY. I dont know what happend here, but this app went from great, friendly and nice, to expensive, greedy and predatory ""pay to use"" style. From 5 to 1 star and searching for equivalents"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads of Splitwise pro everytime I add an expense is very annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 3 payments for day makes this app unusable. Just sell it, why have a free version? Avoid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app, I've been using it for years with my flatmates and gf's"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting app uninstall it there are thousand apps who can do better than this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useful but we have to pay 3 dollar which makes it worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really great app for quicky tracking expenses. Then with no warning they started ""rate limiting"" how many expenses you can add in one day with the free version, to 3 maximum."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version limited to 3 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy ah paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really helpful tool for keeping track of IOUs! me and my partner use it regularly and it helps avoid arguments over who paid for what and when. Easy to use and it's reliable too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"£40/yr for a money splitting app, what a joke. Use something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use it a lot, but limit of 3 daily expenses makes it not usable anymore :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was too good and great convenience initially in early 2015 due to its simplicity, but now since Dec 2023 it became terrible due to its creepy pathetic monetization scheme with limit of only 3 transactions per day and 10 second video ad before entering a transaction. A Money Grab expense manager app doesn't allow you to enter the expenses itself. Its a best time to go for another alternative app. Editing the rating from 5 (Best) to 1 (Worst)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This takes the guess work, frustration and bias billing out of the game... awesome 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and easy to use. I have used it for a few vacations with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used spliwise pay for first time and transferred money a week ago and it is still pendind even though my bank sent it 5 days ago. I will never use it again and will recommend against it to all my friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient for Girls Trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"don't use it, it was created by corporate greedy people. use open source alternatives or other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"easy to use with family and friends. great when going away with a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes trips away with friends so much easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You cant release a free app with all the features, get customers and then launch your premium version restricting features for the free users. That's just bad planning. Splitwise has become really annoying and this has been done on purpose. I used to love this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to have this app to help us track expenses between me and my friends but now its filled with ads. I had to reinstall because I have a new phone and I instantly uninstalled because I don't want that. have us pay for the app and remove the adds please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very bad app we are maintaining our expenses very good but so don't have benefit of stealing money like we do with our friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's easy. it's great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was amazing until they went ""premium"". No more. Back to my spreadsheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, sometimes not working properly. Or sometimes it takes too much time for reload date."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free version is almost useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I can't settle up in Euros apparently. Nor am I allowed to convert from EUR to GBP without paying a subscription. Might as well use a different free app that allows it. Enshi**ification in action!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: Been using the app for around 10 years now. Recently, tried to use it to discover the restrictions on the free version. Seems lame. Making money for the service is important, but not like this. An expense splitting app that doesn't let you add expenses. Really? This will only drive away your loyal users to other competitors. The sales strategy needs to be improved or the executive in charge of this decision needs to be fired. Editing my rating to 1 star ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was ok initially. But made it paid app & who is going to spend such amount when many free app are available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Their approach to monetisation has made the app completely unusable. Bizarre choice when the app doesn't offer any features not readily available in other free to use apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be awesome, now the paywall is so early that it's basically unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscribe after 4 free expenses? What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was good for what it does, but recent changes (e.g. transaction limits) have made it a bit too annoying to use without the (expensive) pro edition."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really useful, even with no premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The effort put forth in trying to get me to pay for Pro will result in my stop using the app. Too bad, it was helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for a household of 4 people. We track all common expenses and pay anytime we want. You can easily just bank transfer and settle up in the app separately. Using any currency"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's very helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It appears there is now a max of 4 expenses per day? So it's not even worth adding all of the current expenses to get Splitwise up to date unless we wish to pay for Splitwise Pro right away. Hard to tell if it's going to be worth it this early on. Seems like quite a disappointment for a once-great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy paywall makes it absolutely useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient app to use during a trip with friends. Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wonderful have been using it for years and have recently gone Pro. Highly recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So very helpful for sharehouse bills & food... the best!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app sucks now, developers got greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used to love Splitwse. Too many useful features are subscription-only, which is unfortunate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10s ad to add an expense every time. just use the web interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I recieved a push notification telling me ""last chance pro offer"" - obviously nonsense marketing. I'm not having apps on my phone that behave like that. Never again. Bye bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro sounds like only useful version and it's subscription model only and too expensive for what if provides. Information needed to know this isn't obvious on play or app store which is further reason to be leary of developer. I'd happily pay something for a non subscription license if app proved as useful as everyone says it was prior to limitations being added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"No option neither to send link to Telegram, nor copy the link."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"poor app it's not free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, using it for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for siblings lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very cool! Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Quite Irresponsive and you can't add two bills at a time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrong sum up of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app on trips, makes repaying people so simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Should not be paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are so many apps which provides all features for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It sucks! Can't add more than 3 payments a day. It used to be the best app to split bills, now they require a premium to use it's basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowed two expenses entry one day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit and the 10 secs delay has made this very difficult to use. I tried adjusting to the new modifications but I have had enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was better before...now asking for money...sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Show ads but don't block users from adding new expenses. Will uninstall this app after settling everyone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Yeah like it Paid tier is worth it for a complicated situation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used it many times in the last and quite handy when travelling in the group. On a recent trip I've used it again and now it has quite an annoying paywall with maximum free entries per day and 10 second wait per entry"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I did a road trip with three other people, all paying expenses randomly for all or some of the other travellers at different locations and occasions, and all of us paying the others back random amounts at also random times, but we all used splitwise contientiously to keep track of every payment, and it worked wonderfully for us: no money troubles between friends at all! I also use it in my normal life to track occasional shared expenses with close family that we only settle up every so often."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version works fine but the fact they want so much money for a subscription is absurd. I feel $5 dollars once would be a lot considering they get to track my spending. Edit to reply. I am not confused, I am disappointed in the greed of this company."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad app, asks for subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many advertisement for premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I guess you don't even need to write why I gave you just two stars? Plus one point just because everything was great before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise is great for large groups trying to figure out how to pay each other. Splitwise, does all the hard work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The pay function is very confusing and disappears if you open it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is very helpful and useful for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's all hidden behind paywalls now. Too bad I've been using it for years. Time to change for something else!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Absolutely loving this app, But there shouldn't be any subscription model. 🥲🥲"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The free plan only allows you to add very few expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have to pay now for basic functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not allowing to add more payments unless we buy the Pro membership. Splitwise was better before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Have used Splitwise 3 times in the last 3 or 4 years. Unfortunately this time the numbers just weren't working out as some were in £ and others in €. It looked close to being settled other than the change in currency but after doing a change (via a manual exchange rate), the numbers completely changed. This wasn't the case on previous trips but we use it so rarely (3 days a year) it doesn't warrant buying the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app looks so fancy and well-made, but that is just appearance: you have to buy Premium if you want to add more than 4 purchases (FOUR). THAT IS JUST STUPID, HOW CAN YOU LIMIT PURCHASES!??!?!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing, good job"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing also the monthly distribution of the expenses, showing only the 50% split of the total amount and not the amount for each individual of the group makes this app a joke..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super user-friendly app that makes it easy to keep track of who spent what, especially on group holidays and events."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have used multiple times on trips with friends, fantastic to keep track of expenses, and not have to split each transaction at the time!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for trips with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sadly making everything paid ruins this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limited expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really useful to sort bills when flatting!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was a must have for everyone but with the recent changes it's atrocious. There's a hard limit of 4 transactions and you gotta watch ads for every transaction starting from the 3rd one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Love the attention to detail."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its not working propeely it divides my expenses automatically it settle up my expense automatically which will make my budget dead....."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app for what it does, but expensive for the pro, and monthly / yearly cost?! Otherwise can only add so many expenses a day. I'd be willing to pay a one-off expense for the app, but I feel the app designers are greedy for this factor. There is now another app that does the exact same thing and doesn't charge, don't use splitwise guys, it's not worth feeding their greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't tell upfront that it will eventually only allow 3 entries max per day. Started blocking me on the 3rd day of use. Very deceitful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is so convenient and easy to understand and use. It avoids the hassle and sometimes the embarrassment of trying to keep track of whom paid for what and where. Ideal for travelling couples (or multiple individuals) to track expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use Tricount instead!! Used to love using this app. I was constantly spreading the word about it's usefulness and convenience. Would keep using it, even with ads, but the paywall limiting added transactions was a really poor decision by the team. Way to trash a really good idea. Don't pay for Premium! It's definitely not worth what they're trying to charge."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just waiting for the substitute application to pop up before I uninstall it. Too much ad\subscription-coersion\hassle for an app that I use about once in 3 months."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a really good app to keep track of spending on trips with friends or colleagues. Easy to use and settle up. Don't like the prompts to upgrade but that's not a major problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great when it was free. Limiting 3-4 entries a day makes it complicated to use, unless you pay and get pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A very poorly designed and confusing app. You can't actually settle amounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to have decent use of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"After the using app for ten years they are limiting max expenses to 3 per day. Time to switch to another platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It asks for Pro for all options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It sucks how greed ruins good products"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, saves us time in splitting expenses among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not really free anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very practical app that solves a daily real life problem. I've been using it with 3 friend groups so far and everyone agrees that its been a gamechanger. You have to spend the first few moments understanding the UI, but once that's done it easily becomes an app you can use daily. The free version has been sufficient for my needs so far. Does what it says on the tin, highly recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"we use it for all group outings. no more adding up receipts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"User friendly and very helpful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I made a group and sent a link to all members, members can see , but in my app it won't show , automatically delete But it shows in expense, I can't edit that now, i had paid for this app. Its horrible , always have a problem whenever i use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"$5 a month for this app is absurd. I would happily pay a 1 time fee, but a subscription is comical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful easy to use 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nicely designed, but with update there are now irritating nagging notices to upgrade to the pro version that limit it's usability - some of them even have a ten second timer before you can add an expense. Recommend using something else. Update: They've made it even worse by limiting the number of expenses you can add. This is the worst kind of monetization, where you cripple existing features. Moving on, and this company deserves to go kaput."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, it ask for soo many details while adding trip and people on the trip that im deleting this app and installing some other app that will directly start adding people and expenses and like this app which starts only when you first login and then put dates of trip etc etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable. The app is a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor want to subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It requires all the access from login info to contacts and doesn't work simply..it notifies the other person also..there's no way that this can be done privately :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Record expenses in group, easy to explain, it is best app to record expenses for trips,party etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was very awesome earlier, now it requires a lot of ad watch to work for us. Not that much smoother experience now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy way to settle bills with friends instead of split billing everything and especially good when split bills are not allowed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ad to upgrade in pro version bye bye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be very handy, but the free version is now limited to 4 entries per day. As such it is largely useless unless you pay, which is fine. But it's no longer ""free, pay for features"", it's ""pay for basic functionality"", which I can get from other apps (Splid). I wish the devs all the best, but don't give up the massive marketshare you won through free tier! Also, I would be much more likely to pay for ""2 weeks"" when I'm on a trip (which is when I use), than annual oronthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest upgrade has been a downgrade, literally. Totals tab in group is now reserved for pro users only!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"User interface not user-friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many limits on adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The did the free version completely unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have app if you are splitting expenses on vacation! Me and my friends did a Japan trip and when it came to splitting meals, groceries and gifts it was super easy to keep track. There is a built in currency converter so no math required. Setting up the group's was super easy as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome apo. Makes splitting up big group expenses easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always asking to ta take pro subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was a great app, I have used it for a couple of years, and even after the limitation on the number of transactions, and adds it was still fine, but the new updates cut completely the logic of a share account. Now, it is not possible to see how much each member has paid monthly. I hope it gets fixed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses addition limit in day is a worst thing I have seen till now in this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's the WORST app for this function. Totally confusing and weong"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"helps me in trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made our trip to Berlin so much easier! Quiet mind, solid friendship. And nice to have a memory of all of our expenses... 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too aggressive premium advertising"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was Amazing before you did everything you can to get us to do a premium subscription, including ruing the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes enjoying life with friends so easy (when money's involved)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The Entry works good, but when you get invited to join a team, you have to buy a pro license if you want to do more than 4 Entries. If someone turns on the simplify mode, you get just a number you owe or someone owes you, there is no way to reconstruction of how this number was created, you just need to trust the number, what for me is a no-go, so I cancelled my subscription after using it once, personally I can't recommend it to people who like to understand how the number they owe was created."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is easy to use. Just makes group trips so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good anymore for free use. They have restricted the features too much to get subscriptions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love, love, love Splitwise for traveling or having adventures with groups of friends. It makes it so easy to track shared expenses and settle up at the end. The ease of doing different types of sharing of expenses (evenly, by percent, by amount) makes it a treat to use for large groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty bad app, just 5 expense per day, and subscription around amazon prime, where you just need to store excel data"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm. Only ""hiccup"" is when you have to add multiple entries (more than 3 I think?) in a row with the free version. You run onto a forced delay. But honestly, it doesn't bother me 🤷‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pro price is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fabulous way to travel with friends. Stress free!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monthly subscription is killing Splitwise....bye bye...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer usable without (the overpriced) pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"'Totals' doesn't work anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 2 payment option in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Overally good, but with the recent limits imposed on free users, it's unusable. I suggest using an alternative to this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's quite helpful for college students and for other to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads and daily limit of 3 is the worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Impossible to find verify option to use PayPal. Maddening."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I cannot track my total expenses in the total tab. It is so irritating,this started happening all of a sudden in this month. This app used to be the best app for expenses splitting, but it is no longer the case now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful to use since they started with payed supscriptions. Competitors have way better functioning apps without adds and paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"im enjoying this app especially travel time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A lot of ads uninstalling this crapp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much adds. And not allowing to add more items"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"After 2 expenses then have to see adds."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Does not support horizonntal mode for tablets. Free version sucks with limited expenses addition"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super speedy way to set up and pay friends/family quickly whilst sharing costs equally"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it split my wife"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of transactions was a great move! Keep it up and user base will never return to this app.. rendered this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"exceptional service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but they've implemented so many challenges in the free version (ad for every entry, limit of 4 entries a day) that it doesn't feel worth using anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Prfxt app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be really good, but it's limiting the amount you can use it in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a very good app when that was free now for every options you have to pay otherwise it is un useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now can't we see total expenses too???? Nice degradation Splitwise 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy for group travel, even the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this app is great for trips with multiple friends or family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Daily use app for students"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid app, doesn't let me add expense all they care about is money and their subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy, simple, and straightforward app to split expenses among families/friends when going on trips or doing activities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There's a bug, total spend and my share show 0 when I have paid a lot of things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes it easy to keep track of who owes who and how much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most important aspect total u spend for is removed from the total section, made it useless for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great application..great help"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Some ads for premium, but they aren't too annoying. Good functionality. No bugs except for people using different languages in the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"After update, totals is not working. Please check with your development team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"la mejor app para dividir gastos"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super useful even in free mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4.99 USD per month? Delusional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app to be used in group trips!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the new feature of limited transactions is really bad. removes the overall purpose of expense tracking on the go"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"In the last update I can not see how much money I have spent personally in a group. I can see only the total amount and my share."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the latest update, they removed the ""Total you paid for"" on the Total page. Some of us were using that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I’ve been using Splitwise since 6 months till using , and it has made managing shared expenses so much easier! Whether it's splitting bills with friends, tracking group expenses, or managing monthly budgets, this app does it all seamlessly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is a bug in the app...like it is not showing the shares in total for any group....before it was showing but now we can't see anything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It is a good app.But should have made it into an aggressive premium subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Within minutes of download and use, they asked for paid version of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After update there is not showing that how much I paid only showing you share.its annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There is no option to add more people while trying to edit an expense, thats so strange"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version now unusable due to it preventing you adding more than 4 expenses in 24hr"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of transactions per day defeats the purpose of the application. (Note this occurred after private equity got involved...) Would recommend finding alternative application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"spectacular app for small group purchases, the maths is like black magic, amazingly smooth tool to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty limited free version. 3 expenses a day is ridiculous. It's not going to make people pay for the Pro version it's just going to frustrate your user base and have users look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charges for adding more than 4 expenses is stupid. I'd rather use pen and paper."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking your spending and also to split amongst friends. Only downside is the premium is too expensive for an app I will use occasionally. Otherwise, I would have bought the premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Hate the new limitation so that you have to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The won of a marketing over common sense. Until you pay you're not allowed to add more then 5 expenses a day, which makes the app completely unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app but has absurd paywalls and intrusive ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Take a 5 star free app. Restrict nearly all features. Start extremely greedy paywall for basic features. It's time for the competition to erase ""Splitwise"" from existence."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to use with friends and roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and direct"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but they pay-walled the core features behind a subscription and added a bunch of annoying barriers to using the app for free. Splitwise Pay is also garbage, people sent me money through that which took days to be available in my wallet, then I had to link my bank account, then it wouldn't let me withdraw more than $800/week. It's MY money that they feel entitled to holding onto for an extra few weeks..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be trash but the push to Pro has made it unusable now. 3 transactions a day? Seriously? Corporate greed on full display here. Moved to Splid instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Basic version is really good if you don't need to add too many expenses. Pro version is grossly overpriced -> $40/year for what's basically just a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool to split bills...specially when travelling with more than 2 people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app but now that everything is being blocked by a paywall, life has been difficult. I would be more willing to get a lifetime premium than pay per month in the subscription based payment scheme which is solely made to draw money out of consumers pockets. I hope Splitwise changes this approach."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really easy way to split household expenses and expenses between friends. Also good for budgeting. Really handy app. Would highly recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very help Full app🥰🥰🥰🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'll be moving to Splid. Recent updates have limited the amount of expenses one can add to a group in a single day...to three expenses. What a joke. I've enjoyed using this app but it's not something I use enough to warrant paying for a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version only allows two expenses per day unless you want to pay a monthly fee. Inputting expenses should not be a ""pro"" feature in an expense app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No, I don't want splitwise pro, stop sending me emails and push notifications ( which I can't disable ) advertising it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The settle up calculations in the 'Balances' showing all accumulated to a single person instead of to the persons who owed. Please fix as soon as possible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Extremely aggressive upselling and really annoying daily caps. These ppl are unhinged for believing I would pay 11 leva per month for a simple service like this. Otherwise fine, except for the finance people behind it. Uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helps to maintain perfect balance in accounts as well as relationships. 😄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a good app, but with the new policy, you can only add three expenses per day, which makes this app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App keeps crashing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Clean ui, simple ui and a great experience so far."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Does not let me adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful application to track group expense and much more... better shift to one time fee.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the app stopped being able to correctly calculate expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super awesome and has very useful featured"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a really useful app that has been killed by limiting the amount of expenses we can upload. I'll pay 99p a year for pro. Otherwise I'll just use a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great apps to organize bills and split among friends and families"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient, and easy to use. Can be used to track expenses when partying with friends, or even at home."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"We can split easily from anywhere anytime"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a GENIUS APP. It is very easy to use and a great way of having a virtual 'kitty' , for example, when travelling with a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Overall App is good bud didn't like the pricing. Although free option is there but limiting the expense creation downgrade user experience. Pricing for pro is very high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it's impossible to use if you don't buy the premium version. You have limit expenses per day and a lot of waiting for adding any information. Was the app for the propouse but I don't recomend anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I can't add much expances in one day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good app.. only if it had a Ledger wise view, it would have been awasome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome, really easy to use layout, worked great for a trip with friends, great features with how you can break down/share the costs of items or what is owed. clean interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really helps with roommate bill organization. I've had an interaction with the splitwise app support and they were very quick and helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses per day and a 10 second timer to add expenses? But unlimited expenses when you pay for Splitwise Pro? Terrible business practice. Use ads for revenue, not a subscription. Literally anybody can do this using Excel or a calculator and notes on their phone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic especially for group trips or just simple dinners. Even the free version is serving us well!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app giving wrong calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app in the past Now it forces Ads and Pro membership on you for simple things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"how did I survive before this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant app 👏🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless for free use now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app, is extremely convenient when travelling in different groups. It does seem a little clunky when adding an extra person to a transaction. I found myself having to delete the item and then start again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love Splitwise when it was free. You now have to pay to get the ""Pro"" edition and be able to put in unlimited payments. It is SO inconvenient when on a trip (3 payments a day - really???). You saw green, and because of corporate greed, you ruined what was once an amazing app to use with friends when in vacation. To heck with you. I'm moving to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"While adding the expenses, it ask to subscribe for slipwise pro. Totally a big scam and irritating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't buy subscription, can't do anything in the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yet another greedy jerks with an ""service"" model for an app that does not really need one. And to add insult to injury, the subscription cost is way overpriced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even though I have updated my email id it is not allowing me to buy pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to login to my account even though password reset."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice thing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"w app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Various errors when setting up. This has happened several time. Concept is good but could do with a better database to run the system"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"friendship saver. no more guessing, track it and divide the cost. love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Throws random 10 second delays in your face unless you pay for a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"You'll wonder how you ever managed without it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You should have straight away request for payment to upgrade to pro since you only allowed 3 expenses a day. Not after requiring to key in all members personal information only realised this apps is useless without paying for Pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Makes lots of confusion, one number was added 2 times. Last time's group amount added by itself in new group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for travel expenses in grp. It can split evenly or by few ppl. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise has helped me remove the mental work of expense breakdown especially amongst group expenses. It presents multiple ways to breakdown expenses like overall summary owed for one individual taking into account other expenses and one transaction versus another approach with multiple transactions to multiple people. In summary, a very helpful tool. I would strongly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Their pricing plans are useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for splitting expenses during trips. It was worth getting the full version during our trip. Made life much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I liked it until they limited you to 3 events per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use this all the time to split expenses with my spouse. It works great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great, simple app. But someone not-so-smart decided to make it mandatory to pay 3€ a month to keep using it. I'll be switching to a free app, just like just about everyone I know who uses it. Edit: I realize that. Limiting it to 4 expenses a day essentially makes the paid tier mandatory, which is my whole point. Just didn't want to explain more than necessary in the review. Whoever decided on the tiers at splitwise should not be given power over decisions like that ever again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Only good if u have subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unfortunately the app is suffering from enshittification. Used to be better :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A simple app that serves the purpose and works fine."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfecta para todas las ocasiones"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app whenever you travel with your friends and colleagues. it's very easy, instant, without hassles and you can see the break-up instantly. wonderful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G and was told I cannot download Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version is very limited, and the paid version is a subscription that's way overpriced given the tiny tiny rudimentary application. Splid does the same job for free with unlimited expenditures"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience Because every 20sec there is ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to help manage shared expenses - even easier to use now can link bank account to settle up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"add function to show how much exactly each member of group has spend. Now it's showing only for the logged in user. It should show the same for all users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise did not work for us as there was duplication of some entries, some members could not get on no matter what they tried and we had to abandon it altogether and create an Excel spreadsheet from scratch to function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am using Splitwise for over 6 months and i am very satisfied with this app as well as my friends ,but from 2 days i am unable to add any expense to my group what can i do please help .Thank You Thanks ,but the problem has been solved."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing to add more than 4 bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Goodbye, Adios, Splitwise...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"H. Ii me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying. Better apps out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From the best app to the worst... 3 transactions per day... It's time to move on to some alternative :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the way everything is set out for who owes what and you can look at group expenses and what each individual has paid. Takes so much of the pain out of figuring out expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ideal für die Abrechnung in Urlauben mit Freunden. Die Begleichung der Schulden ist einfach unf transparent und auch kompliziertere Aufteilung sind möglich. Auch gut, um den Überblick über die Ausgaben zu behalten."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can only link 3 accounts so I still have to type my expenses manually. Why should I pay for manually typing my expenses? I'm moving to splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Advertisment all the time and an account is needed. There are way better alternatives like Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was able to add four experiences, then I got hit with a paywall. Worthless app at this point. I'll use a spreadsheet next time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitkaro - is better than this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Satisfactory"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A simple, effective process to record expenses and share costs among user group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro version is terrible value for money and the free version is basically useless with restrictions. See ya."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"TWO transactions(limit) per day on the free tier: hard to even test drive an app like this!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For all your shared expenses split... It is reliable and easy for all simple and complicated splits. ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"absolute clown charging money to do division by 4 calculation trash product"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app for group expenses record."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"there's something wrong with the app. it's not splitting the bills correctly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool for splitting bills, it does what it says"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app was the goat but after the over restrictive money grub update, the free version is hardly usable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been religiously using this app for many years, and the feature of only allowing few expenses to be added per day for free users is absurd....if there was a one time payment fee for this app I would have got it but there is no such option!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not at all easy to understand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Allows only 2 expenses adfree then 2 after lots of ads & that's tye daily limit. Many free options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor and pathetic always try to sell pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very easy to use. very useful to split bills in a household. lots of options in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"cool app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years and it was great for a while. Today I logged in and could only input 2 expenses each with a 10 sec ad for Splitwise Pro. I'll be looking for an alternative because Splitwise is getting worse and worse for it's free users and Pro is just way too expensive to justify paying for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"one of the best tools to maintain financial transparency between friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great but since the ""pro"" offer, it limits users to 3 expenses per day. The free option has become an unusable demo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The aggressive and expensive monetization of the app leaves it at 1 star. A one time payment of $50 or yearly for $25, more then happy to pay. But $40 for one year? That's absurd. It's an amazing app that's super easy to use. Too bad someone made a really short sited decision tanking its username and good will."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!Keep improving please!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great app that comes very handy in time of need"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"😍😍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version isn't good enough"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great until it's not free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bogus"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the daily limit of 4 expenses on the free plan sucks and ruined the whole experience for me. migrating to a competitor now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I had an amazing experience using Splitwise, it makes mine and my roomates spendings so much easier and calculated. Thanks for this exceptional app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"exceptional app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps for balancing group, family, trip debts. Been a fan since the last 18months."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to upload picture using my Android phone compared to IOS."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They only 3-4 entries daily which is unrealistic. There are other good alternative to this app. So I'm uninstalling this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use this a lot and loved it. The change to make it paid makes the app unusable, better to create a spreadsheet or one of the many other free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Way too much of a pay wall. Make it a one time payment and I'd buy the app. Also, please make it so that I can edit the venmo or zelle account names instead of just defaulting to my email..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They now only allow 3 transactions a day. My group of 33 people are now downloading an alternative app and deleting this 1"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app isn't working properly atm and it's adding expenses to the wrong people in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst and can add can limited expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great before ads and paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really useful and easy to use app. I use it whenever I am on a trip with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless with daily limit entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed has been the downfall of this app. The subscription model is outrageous towards the users who have been using this app for ages. I'm not against paying for an app, specially if it's as good as this one used to be, but the pricing is just not right. Please offer a one time payment option at a reasonable price."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App to use with friends on trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful, even the free version is great for roommate shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. VERY USEFUL."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent way of keeping track on vacation!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good but not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great way to settle up for days out, theatre, cinema and meals with my partner."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely repulsive behaviour from the team! I understand you guys need to sell us the premium but atleast don't hamper the daily usability of the app! Why the hell do you need to restrict us in putting daily entries to 4? Absolutely ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app when going on trips and family functions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to split expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"completely unusable now that it limits to 3 expenses per day - used to be my favourite app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Waah nyc app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sad to see a great app being downgraded like that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very clear. Very simple. Very user-friendly. ☆☆☆☆☆ 100% Recommended!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Bery gud ap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terribly money hungry, if you don't buy the 'pro' version (which is basically paying for notes) you have a LIMIT on how many expenses you can add in a day, plus you have to wait 10 seconds (yes just wait) if you want to create expenses for free. It's so weird that the devs of this ""app"" are just focused on milking it for as much as possible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expense allowed per day. No use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The only app I use for travel! Super easy to use and super fair pricing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It works well for non-recurring payments, for example, to split a bill from a season rent or a bar. It behaves weirdly for recurring payments as the app doesn't have the concept of future payments well designed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app and bank pay is just awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Badhiya app hai bilkul! Apne Rishtey bachaye, aaj hi apnaaye. ✨Splitwise ✨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entries for expenses..wow!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"v. useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very frustrating to use it now. Keep pushing for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and so helpful on group trips. Free version works great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Dosto mai kalesh nahi hote"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise itself is a great app - hence not a 1-star review. Recent changes to limit the free version to 3 expenses per day is a dealbreaker. Splitwise has built a lot of goodwill, if they communicated this change perhaps I'd be willing to pay to support a useful app. Given the poor communication for a massive change, that goodwill has been shattered. There's a particular issue in wanting people to pay for a service that can fairly easily be replicated by others (e.g. a spreadsheet or other app)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why they asking subscription fees for such a basic app?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful and helpful app to manage group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be great app. But the recent updates that restrict basic functionality like limiting transactions added to only 4 per day have made it absolutely useless. I'll clear all my pending calculations on this app and uninstall it. A good thing ruined yet again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app for planning trips and activities with groups. Makes it easy to keep track and settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Enshitification in effect. This app used to be great. Now they make you watch adds for the pro version to add expenses and they've added an upper limit to how many expenses you can add at a time as a non pro user. Use tricount instead and hope they don't become awful like splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now that adding expenses is limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Trust me, Best usecase app for all Friend groups!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst App. They don't need new customers anymore. Hunger for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really Helpful and Stress relifer App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. simple and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used to be decent. But now since u can only add 3 or 4 expense a day. Its become very hard to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I don't know how my roomies and I would pay rent and split expenses any other way. it's been essential for us to make life so much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until they start to limit transakcions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They set a limit for number of expenses per day and to top it off they have ads after first 3 expenses everyday. You have to purchase premium for additional expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Complex app . can't understand it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very reliable and easy to use! Super fast response for trouble shooting! Thanks Quincy!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restriction on entry is bad move. Not happy with it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app was great in the past, now only adds and pro version update popping up. Not worth the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great until they changed the in-app payment. I get that they want to turn a profit, but if you don't want to use their Splitwise pay it can be pretty frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to record and split expenses for our social group outings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app we use for traveling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is perfect, but I'll never buy Pro :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very excellent 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty simple to use, and it certainly makes keeping track of who owes what to whom much easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful. Simple. Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"it did not calculate corectly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pricing model is predatory. Furthermore the app limits inputs to 4 items a day, and then pushes you for buying the Pro plan. I'd rather watch adverts and keep using free plan than be forced to pay to use the app while it states free is also available but made technically unusable. This is really an under the belt move by the developers to force people to subscribe. Hence I am rating the application a 1 star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Basic features are limited now, need premium to add more splits. Bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Before was awesome, with the new pricing model they screwed it up as usual like most of the abo apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but they've sacrificed alot of the functionality to push their pro version. Just put ads on the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app for keeping track of spending when splitting expenses! also love that it connects to venmo!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Toouch restrictions on free. Not even better than excel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth downloading at all. They limit how many transactions you can add each day on the free version (3-5 transactions I think) and forces you to wait 24hrs til you can add more. There are better apps that serve the same purpose and with better tags and insights for FREE and without such tight limitations. Disappointing honestly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app not anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app. Needs more features like total spend by the group etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible switch to aggressive Pro advertising"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes make it difficult to use the app. There is a maximum of 3 ransactions per day. Splitwise get your vision straight , you are going in the wrong direction you fools. Tell your ceo to stop just thinking about money and starting thinking about the product There is plenty of free apps that does the same thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't getting installed in pappe's phone please 🥺"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows only 4 transactions in one day. Very very 👎 bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"best app to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It says my phone number is registered already, obviously it is I am logging in but would not let me enable splitwise pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the absolute best way to do friend trips! Can't recommend this app enough. My friend and her boyfriend use it for tracking their shared living expenses too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app until the new update. Can't even add expenses in peace without running out of daily limits. Hello. That's the whole point of an app. Better use pen paper. 🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using it since 2020, it was an amazing app but after the latest update of 4 expenses per day. It feels like they want us to uninstall the app. So here I am uninstalling it as there are many substitutes available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Allowed only 4 entries for each day. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app has been great for managing group expenses with regular friend groups and your weekly football /badminton socials. Easy to add or remove people from group expenses too. The app UI might need some changes to make it more user friendly especially for new users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love it!! so helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simple to use interface. clear instructions about how to enter your own debts and requests for others to repay their debts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't believe the app lost its sole purpose and functionality by limiting transaction counts per day. Do you really feel people are going to wait for a day and they dont have a pen and paper with them? Truly the dumbest move. App is so useless if its not pro version. Better to just take 2 minutes extra and do the math. Devs do not understand their market position and target audience to force people to buy pro version to even use basic functionality.Enjoyed for so many years, time to say good bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is a limit of 4 transactions per day, which makes free version of this app barely usable for me even for basic functionality, hence the rating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The math is screwed up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app for finance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app since it's paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to record expenses and settle balances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but the free tier now only lets you add 4 expenses per day and you have to watch a 10 sec each time. There are better free apps that do the same thing now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"splitwise is just so amazing... if only everyone could understand it's potential.... and I hope they create a way to track spends from credit cards etc...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"分錢啦"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version won't let you add expenses anymore. I don't recommend using it. look for other free apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is pathetic to not even let the basic users add expenses without seeing ads, the advanced features should be paid but the basic functionality of the app was killed with this new update, pathetic app and pathetic experience!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Looks good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very easy to manage roommate joint expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Saved my wallet in many situations. Recommended :) Really easy to use, both for readers and for writers. 2024 EDIT: app is not usable, after 10 purchases it blocks and pretends to upgrade to paid membership. I will switch back to the old pen and paper system."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bugs with daily limit reset, the app gets unusable with time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Okay app, understandable limitations on free version, but for the love of God add a calculator function to ""add expenses"" feature. Such a no brainer!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app 👍👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is really easy and simple to use and makes splitting not sharing money so much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for splitting bills with your friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it. Together with the Wallet app, is the perfect companion for my personal finances. Keep up the improvement and renovation of the app :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was one of the best apps of this kind, until they drastically limited the basic functionalities, forcing you to buy the pro-version or move to another free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely unusable. Basic features under a paywall is a stupid idea. Time to find an alternative. It was good when it lasted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great up until now, but they've added a max number of transactions you can add per day without Pro which makes this completely unusable. Also has an unskippable 10 second ad for Pro every time you add an expense now. I get you need to make money, but just throw in banner ads or something! Will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Classic case of greed. Need to subscribe monthly or annually with no one off payment or lifetime subscription option (and it is not worth it for the capabilities of this app). Free daily limits are low and even when waiting for them to reset the next day, they don't and say ""limit reached"" when i have yet to open the app today. Unusable. Long time user no more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"free version does the trick tbh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is one one of the best apps I have ever installed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It should have grouping in groups for couples. Because of Simplified payments feature we didnt understand how much we had to pay and she paid double to wrong person because she wanted to also cover for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app that really cares about sharing!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible update of restricting daily usage to 4 entries & asking to update to pro just for adding entries. Time to switch to different app. @splitwise way to distroy the successful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"getting paid and ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"SplitKaro is a great alternative to this app. Their ego will be under control"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro is not worthable and free version is not at all usable with very limited option even they block the expense addition."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app until the recent aggressive marketing tactics and limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing and cannot be used to check the spending on categories. Totals etc... People use travelmoney which is simple and great. Unfortunately iPhone users don't have travelmoney..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish money minded app uninstall it now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 2 expenses per day for free users. What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Outstanding and beautiful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and avoids a lot of work and confusions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps. Useful for daily life, holidays, going out with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made me broke😭can't even sleep peacefully thanks to this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm using this apps since 2018 and is worth full"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the only split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hatt tmkc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app with too much features it's just confusing af"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor UX for a high premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use the App for travel expenses/shopping/etc with friends and Family and I am super happy. Would recommend to everyone :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously... pay to add expense is worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Bad interface and complicated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent for managing expenses between friends. I use it for discreet trips so we can settle up with friends at the end of the trip but also use it with other friends to keep a tab on ensuring someone has been left with a hefty contribution so we can share group expenses appropriately.. Keep updating please as I think some better interface will make it easier for newbies."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I like splitwise until it introduces premium model which is simply senseless. Soon this app vanishes if it stick to limiting user to add only 4 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app due to payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best and most useful app I have ever had on my phone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best application I ever used."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"needs more features, splitting bills by items is difficult, no spreadsheet interface, can not attach receipts and attachments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app couple years back when we travel as a group across USA during our work&travel programme. Back then it was so cool. Lots of features in free versions. I tried this app couple days back and man. It is unusable now. Shame, I have to look for alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Every time ask pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max 4 moves per day ewww cheap move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a free app with optional paid features, now it's a subscription based paid app with a very limited free demo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: was 5 star earlier but now 1 star. The app is unusable now after the updates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's now a paid app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was great.. until it suddenly became ""pay to play"" Plenty of other free apps that do the group split thing perfectly fine."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst, who adds Advertisements for adding expenses. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It over Complicates things. Much easier apps to use out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a brilliant app for keeping track of group spending."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Was a paying user. Annoyed with how they've handled their monetization and free users. Cancelled my subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads can't add expenses without using pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for long time. Now I request everyone (new & old users) to switch it to another app which provides free of cost. Limiting to add only 4 expenses per day is really a bad update. Now I don't recommend any users to install and waste your time in this app. A very big thumbs down to Split wise and their team👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app for settlement of contribution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Makes a day out or a holiday with friends much easier as you can track who paid for each item and it sorts it all out for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"अतिशय उपयोगी आणि वापरायला सोप्पे !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is irritating to use with all the restrictions. Would recommend to rather not use it and save yourself from frustration. I get that devs need to make money but if the app is useless when it's free, don't make it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good. Only 4 expenses per day can be added. Not fare to buy plan monthly yearly plans which is to be used for few days during trips. Either have some cheaper plan for 10 days else people should switch to different apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good Application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sometime app is lagging. I added expense but not showing and suddenly show all. You will have to work on UI. Make it more user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful calculation app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are locking basic functionality (adding more than few expenses, like 10, per day) behind paywall. I appreciate that there is no ads, but if I can't add expenses the app is useless..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Me and all my friends leaving the app due to the new expense adding limit. Useless limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"don't install thi app ,forcing to use paid pro service ,shame shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, asks for premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! Very helpful and makes life easier. Especially when sharing a household."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be really good, free with ads which was fine. Now it's pushing it's pro membership and has severely limited the amount of expenses you can add. This app is now not worth it, way easier just to do it on excel. Don't get it. The pro feature is not worthwhile and a needless money grab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"helpful apps, especially during trips with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable .. hide everything behind paywall, useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Some additional limitations suddenly imposed on the free version which brought severe inconvenience to my trip. The app doesn't allow us to record more than ~7 spendings. We ended up tracking our spendings using our phone's note-taking app. Stupid app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically unusable now without paid version... Use an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple app. U get what u want : sharing, tracking and settling expenses seamlessly. have been using it for 10+ years now and quite happy with it. go for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. Easy to use for holidays...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, completely killed by greedy monitisation. £40 per year, per person, to be able to add more than 3 expenses a day is absurd when there are so many good free alternatives. Do yourself a favour and download Tricount instead. I was embarrassed to have reccomeneded Splitwise for a group holiday this year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's an awesome app to keep track of a trip with mates or family. One person can pay for the whole bill at different places and another other bill and it will work out who owes who"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Was a great app, now unusable for trips due to limit of 4 or 5 entries per user per day (single quota for all groups). Kind of pushing pro so hard now that users are leaving forever 🤷‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Give all option free please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app...it should be a freeware"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app makes your life much easier and takes care of all calculations after a gathering with friends. I am reducing my rating due to an unreasonable charging model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting experience. If you're not gonna let me put in all expenses at once then FOR GODS SAKE TELL ME EARLIER OR AT THE START OF THE APP. I took time to download this stupid app to fix my expense and after creating a group and inviting my friends on the app and everything it told me after all of that that I cannot add expense for the day. Terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not working.. Getting error while loggin in."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to keep tracking your mutual expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Mundane apps like these shouldn't be priced"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me manage expenses for groups for literally about 10 years. I also use it for my relationship expenses and it never lets me down. I'm on the free version - they've locked down the free features a tiny bit more recently but I still don't pay for it and what I get on the free version is still more than enough. I almost wish they locked the free version down a bit more so that I'd need to pay for pro, lol. Sad that it's only 4.1 on Google Play because it's a 5/5 app. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Used for a trip with 4 friends for 7 weeks and it made sharing the costs super easy. Recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't charge for basic functionalities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was once a great free to use app and one of its kind, until they started charging (by aggressively promoting the pro version of their app) for even the fundamental functionalities. For example they added a cap on the number of expenses you can add on a day. This in my opinion is a deal breaker. There are plenty of apps that does the same job for free, so I will be moving on to something else. Thanks for the service you once provided, not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is rendered useless because of the limit on the number of expenses a person can add in a day (the current limit is 3 or 4 expenses in a day)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires you to subscribe to Pro for the app to be useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expensive Freemium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible feature for free version. Unusable. Paid version extremely expensive for glorified calculator app.,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Noting is frew now.. their business model is now worst at it s peak"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Locking basic features like adding many expenses behind a pay wall is just ridiculous. This app already didn't offer much benefits over doing expenses with spreadsheets, now it's just even worse. Un-installed and I'm going back to sheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"3 years ago the app worked great and you paid if you wanted. Now, it's pretty much a subscription app to share expenses with your friends. On the good side, it'll force me to create a good Xcel sheet for the expenses. Lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the expense limit now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Decent app to keep track of shared expenses in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a good app with all the necessary basic features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"my friends and i use it regularly for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good App until they forgot they're just a more comfortable excel sheet. Maximum expenses per day, ads to buy pro literally everywhere to a, in my opinion, too high price. Sorry, it's not enough for that. Switching to another App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why are you charging for basic app utility"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even for adding basic expense, you are made to wait 10 seconds. Can't add more than 3-4 expenses without pro version. Will go for another alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good simple app without any annoying pop ups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise had been one of the go to apps where expenses could be easily splitted but after their 4 entries per day in free tier category, it has not been of much use. On a tour you would have multiple entries and between couple of people you can't add more than 8 entries. It beats the whole purpose to wait for the next to remember the transaction and add them. One suggestion is to increase the transaction limit to atleast 10/day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It would be better if you add direct payment option in app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Searching should not be a paid feature. Every once in a while I find a use for this app and every time I find out that they have made it even worse somehow."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There is only expenses/debit side covered in app. No credit side part is there. This is to be implemented. Must required feature....!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An awesome way to track spending when travelling with friends. I highly recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super util para planes con amigos o familia y tener cuentas claras"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exceptional service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It supposed to be very awesome app, untill it started 10 sec add on every expense entry after some expenses. That make it worse to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"premium features have killed this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of expenses per day makes this unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible free user experience. Imagine having a cap on how many transactions you can have a day,, and also forcing random 10 second ads???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was the greatest app before the update, 3 expenses per day is unreasonable and unusable. If it takes to watch ad to add more expenses, it'll be much usable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made the app useless by asking extra cash for basic functions like adding expenses. Premium should be for additional services, not basic ones. Goodbye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Functional and easy to use. Highly recommend for housemates, travel buddies, regular partying crew, etc. Love the ability to choose who is included in the expense and change fraction/percent of shares"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good. It is not worth your time anymore. 3 transactions per user, per day, is just too limiting for most use cases, and practically a breaking change. Additionally, it's not like there aren't free and easy alternatives- just use a piece of paper or Google Sheets. Who'd pay $5 per month? I'd pay $5 to permanently purchase it, but a subscription? You're free to break your own product, but you should at least inform your users that you've done so, so they know to stay away."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App got greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's so easy to track expenses now when going out with others!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ios has free screenshot upload option, android doesn't. This should be available to android too. Also bring inbuilt calculator in it, it would really help"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Being forced to consider an alternative after having used Splitwise for more than 7 years. Restricting the most basic operation of adding new expenses in the free tier is a really poor choice. The paid tier is too expensive for me, and I don't even need those other bells and whistles."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Advertisement and limited entry per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"A great app for college students or kanjoos/chindi people. Now technically, if you really want to divide the money, there should be an option to divide food portion as well. (E.g. If I ate one slice of pizza then I will pay for one slice only. Why divide equally then? Huh? Or I only had 2 pieces of paneer/chicken from kadhayi paneer/chicken. How would you divide it then? Lmao. JK."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worked great until they started limiting the number of transactions per day. It's a good thing there are now tons of just as good alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I should not be paying 5$ a month just so I can add expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Screwed the free tier, not paying for this and passive aggressive responses from devs on email are sealing the deal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't open after that latest update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes splitting bills much easier and efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic function of this app is recording money transaction for many person, for that I am not going to pay a amount comparable to netflix basic tier subscription. Make a better value subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to use for a group holiday, sharing costs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove the daily expenses limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is my ""go-to"" tool for tracking expenses while traveling with friends or relatives. It just makes things easier, and everyone can see the transactions and know how much they paid in and how much they owe. This eliminates any confusion whether there are two people or 10 people!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't find people who are already there in Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Editing my review, paiso k lye bhikari bab gaye h ye log 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and accurate documentation of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, has everything I needed to track group spending and settle up. very useful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 4 expenses a day. Absolute waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You given expense splits only kindly do add payment share given"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is really amazing and useful, I use it with my friends and it helps us to be clear with our expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to love the app but they limited the amount of expense you can add per day. if it wasnt subscription based i would have purchased but thats just greedy. it is not like they have huge server costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"They have limited few features for pro otherwise smooth app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app,use other free apps, limited usage without pro and frequent ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super helpful every single time it's used. A must for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise used to be very useful as a free user. Now you are limited by the number of expense I can submit in a day. I'd be willing to pay for it if it was a perpetual license, but I will not pay for a subscription for an app that does not provide any meaningful monthly service/updates. I will be moving to an alternative app that doesn't put existing functionality behind paywalls."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unuable due to limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great, but now it's greedy. They removed free features and force users to pay to regain them. It's one thing to introduce new premium features as an incentive to subscribe, it's different to remove existing functionality and hold it hostage. If the app needs to punish free users to be profitable, it wasn't offering enough value in the first place. I really hope they change their business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After you guys started charging, this whole app beats the purpose. Figure out different stream of Avenue to make money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for many purposes involving multiple expenses and billings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very usefull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Premium amount is too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We use Splitwise for so much; from big group holidays to small family meals (kids are adults now lol) I makes allocation of expenses SO much easier with the safety of no bank details being stored."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was great while it lasted. Now its an advertisement platform to make you watch an ad every time you try to do anything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works exactly as advertised. Great for keeping track of group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I could put up with the ads/waiting ten seconds for the free version, but having a maximum number of expenses basically makes this app unusable unless you pay. Really poor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Il limite di aggiunte quotidiane senza versione pro è vergognoso."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, it help me alot 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app until now force you to buy the upgraded version to use it. Uninstalling the app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app One suggestion : please add others online payment method"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you have to upgrade to Premium to be able to do simple stuff, shame!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Annoying that the free version limits you to do few daily entries but otherwise a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst UI for integrating ads within the product. Why there is no option for one time purchase and have to be subscription?! App is ruined with such approach. Time to move to better alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was decent for a while, they seemed to forget that if you want to tank your product it requires a monopoly to keep a customer base. Actively seeking an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you can't use splitwise without pro version then better uninstall it. You should add advertisement and explore other options. Max 4 expenses for a day is not an Better option for someone having multiple expenses, but occasional user. Bug: If you cancel adding expense in between then you can't use 4 expenses even if the limit is 4 for free user. It's not confusion. There is a bug. I was expecting that your developer will accept it and solve, but here is totally opposite mindset.Ask QA regen."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really does simplify shared expenses with friends and family. You can change currency, % .. easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"estragaram o app com essas limitações ridículas, nunca mais uso"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love it, I use it very day with my bf"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Totally nerfed by the developers. Good while it lasted but you should look elsewhere now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Paise paise ka hisab :P .... Easy convinent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Left for another app that does the same but doesn't stop you putting multiple expenses per entry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 1 expense without ad bs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is dead. You get timed out the whole day after a few inserted expenses and have to buy premium which is far too expensive. Just use alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"That's how you dig your own grave!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until prompts to force you to upgrade to the pro version started showing everytime I add an expense, and have to wait 10s until it disappears. Extremely annoying, I will stop using Splitwise. Also you can only add 2 or 3 expenses per day... The app became pointless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like it so far installed about a month. Easy to use. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app when traveling with a group!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I love this app. I just really struggle to conveniently get the things I need to record, recorded. Would be great if there was a widget to allow for quicker and more convenient data entry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app(!), annoying push to try get you to pay for extra features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love it, I will buy the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It does not make sense to be paying the same amount of subscription fees as Netflix for an app I only use occasionally. The pricing model needs to be revised."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Turned a successful free app into a shameless cash grab. I don't understand devs trying to charge for basic features instead of trying out new interesting features that people will be willing to pay for. I understand having to pay the bills but this is just destroying every basic things you can do in the app, even a simple banner ad would better than an ad for every entry and limiting 4 transactions per day is just plain stupid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to record and manage your joint expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Service is a shed level and revenue expectation is god level. Trash app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant, no fuss easy to use, sorts it out for you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app to keep up to date with splitting expenses with people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great to use on trips with friends or a group of people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too much ads and limits on free account, dont want to even keeo trying it out, its more of a hassle than doing my expenses on plain old excel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app all the time - however with the introduction of premium came a whole bunch of paywall blockers. 10 seconds before every expense added & a max of 4 expenses per day? I'll go back to using microsoft excel. I don't recommend this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pahle mera dost mujhse paise nhi mangta tha, ab sbdiwale ne 10000 baki the bolke uska paisa le liya. 😑😑😑"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app as it was really useful. It's no longer the case as it now has a limit of 4 expenses per day. If you log a higher number of expenses this app is not for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is going in with this pricing model? You can only add 1 expense per day and then you are forced to watch annoying adds and after the 3rd expense it shuts down to force you to pay 3€/month. Maybe I would have paid 3€ for a lifetime license, but this is a joke. Do they think they are the only ones in the world with a primary school level of maths? Anyone can do the same thing with a tabulation sheet. And besides, you can just use the competition ""Splitser"" instead. Very bad!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally unusable. Unskippable ads and limit of 4 transactions per day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for a trip with friends, very easy to split the costs between each other"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be good. The delay is an irritating feature to try and ""persuade"" users to upgrade whereas it is more likely to irritate the user and dissuade."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New artificial obstructions to get you to pony up for a subscription, as opposed to adding extra features one would want to pay for, for an app that is used once in a blue moon is obnoxious. Deleted. I'll just use a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very handy app when traveling with family and friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super helpful for group events. have used it many times and it simplifies a bunch of transactions!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update limited the amount of expenses you can add as free user per day. What a scumbag company. Good way to alienate users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"it used to be such an amazing app before they introduced premium for it. limited entries without premium is so irritating. like other apps it's okk if you introduce ads for non premium users. for every trip it used to be my go to app but now no more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You guys are getting money hungry now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very practical, easy to use and helps reduce number of payments ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No issues if you show an add before adding an expense, but asking for pro for more than 3 is not going to work. Thank you for the service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money hunger"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Quite bad because most of the features are behind a payment wall, and there are much better alternatives out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it tries to trick you to pay for their subscription by making the first expenses free, and then charge you after that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is unusable due to the limit of only 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very nice 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now its useless asking for payment even if u want to add 4 transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing pro by restricting features to the point of making it useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'll have to uninstall the app as it no longer serves its purpose. The free version has become almost useless over time, forcing users to switch to the paid version, which is WAY MORE EXPENSIVE than it needs to be. It feels like the developers are gradually stripping away all the features of free version. I understand the need for monetization, but this approach alienates long-time users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying for this. Waste of money for something that can be done by simple calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"better experience and easy to handle my expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using the free version for a while now. Very intuitive and useful product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lots of functionality and used to be a great app but being limited on the number of transactions and forced into the pro version not makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Probably one of the best and most useful apps I ever downloaded. If you travel with friends, in a group ect it just saves so much time in the end of your trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app and a must have for group trips or even just for group expenses like a dinner or a lunch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to only 5 entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Karza dena pdta hai bhaut saara"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. I'm using it when applicable, with friend on vacation/ concerts / events, you name it. it'll easily manage your payments and won't group of more than 2 people, the ""simplify group debts"" will your groups life easier. Much recommended. PS, the premium package is helpful when dealing with multiple currency purchases."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding ads to do basic maths is very disappointing. It was better earlier when the devs were not greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max 3 expenses per day and a 10 sec ad per expense, that's base functionality, I'm getting another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"£4 per month to be able to upload documents, but here's the thing... it's PER PERSON. There's no group option. If I'm trying to keep my roommates honest and ask them for documentation, I also gotta ask them to pay £4 per month? Useless!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cant reset password!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding just 4 expenses a day is terrible option. Hence leaving this app for another one who does this simple thing for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit is not acceptable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Devs: a humble request for seemless functionality. Please add support to third party apps like Google pay so that the due amount is directly reflected on the third party payment app. This is going to make the process seemless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Minimum 5 transaction is not enough moreover its paid app , it should be free with unlimited transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The App is currently not working, the add expense button has stopped working. I contacted support but have had no response to date."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"love it, make sure to only put so many transactions a day because there is a limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is now a paid app for splitting expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice reminder and tracker"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We coliges used this after a week it asks for the Splitwise pro which means payed app we don't want to use any more bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for using with groups and traveling. I really like that it let's you choose how to split an expense and who paid it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a very simple and useful app, but recently it has been making the free version very annoying to use, forcing 5 seconds wait time before adding an expense, and only allowing limited number of expenses per day. Its going to be a short time before users migrate to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing, makes splitting bills with my roommates so easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful and straightforward way to keep track and settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free Tier was nerfed I used to use this app on trips with my friends and it is a lifesaver don't get me wrong. Nowadays I moved with my girlfriend and remembered about this app. I was faced with the daily limit, I hated it but hey I might as well the plan isn't that pricey. Then I found out that both of us would need a subscription, what a cash grab. I think it's fair to make a premium tier but at least give us the option to make a premium group. You guys made a huge mistake with the change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed the business model with a subscription, limiting transactions. Have been using this app for years and this is pure disrespect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Money hungry devs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good and feasible app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please add ,not paid yet, section while distribution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version too restrictive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app! small group of friends love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep tabs on the expenses throughout a trip and settle things at a later time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Capping it to 4 expenses a day behind a paywall is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was a Splitwise evangelist for so long. Then, they took a good thing and completely ruined it with a subscription model. Why? The three expense limit is insane and renders the app unusable. Look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super software"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Jesus, what an awful experience ramming premium down your throat from the moment you do anything in it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version neutered, developers tone deaf, deserves every one star review it gets. Just to be clear I would happily pay a one time fee for the basic functionality that used to be free. The app is useful enough to justify that and I'm fine paying people for their work. But they're kidding themselves if they think a glorified spreadsheet is a subscription service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is very amazing software I have ever used to manage my room expenses. Very thank you to it's maker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. one suggestion is whether there can be an ability to see the break up of the amount settled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Been using it for years for our group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love Splitwise! It has made accountability and tracking of shared expenses SO much easier. Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"request to reduce the yearly subscription fee which is 999rs it is equivalent to Amazon prime video subscription for an year in India request to reduce this huge subscription charges for pro services"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It saves from any disputes and is peaceful between friends and families"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hello don't use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"You have to purchase monthly subscription which is above 100 rupees to use more than 4 split transaction only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pretty useless if you don't buy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally waste You can't use it to add expenses in free version Is that the way to make money....... You are forcing to buy the product version just to add your expenses in expense list"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise since 2018 and have always appreciated its simplicity and utility. However, the recent update for basic users is incredibly disappointing. Adding an ad just to input a transaction and limiting users to only 4 transactions per day is a terrible move. This app used to make splitting expenses hassle-free, but now it feels like a money grab. If you're going to push people toward paid plans, at least keep basic functionality intact. Uninstalling immediately. Terrible update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless app... if they are restricting number of entries in an app like this which is most probably going to be used in any trip (which are also not that frequent), then no point in installing this app... will any day go for free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good way to manage and split expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wahiyatt app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I used this amazing app to manage a bachelor party week with many different transactions. Love the way it let's you convert to one currency and simplify payments!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Imagine paying money for automated accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible app. You can only add 4 expenses a day. I'm on a huge vacation so that's not gonna work for me. I'll just use a spreadsheet. Waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Loved it until the expense limit was added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using the app long time not only they started to make me wait 10s before adding an expense they also limited expenses to 3 a day, ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for sharing expenses with friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be fantastic, since updating its useless. Can only add 3 things a day max, or else pay monthly to use. Im not gonna pay monthly for something i use a couple times a year and could also just do with my calculator. Tricount seems like a good alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Right now after introducing the subscription it's very difficult to use split wise. Splitwise is basically taking advantage of its large user base. Moving away from it is almost impossible as all my friends use it, but limiting the transactions and ads are becoming unacceptable at the ongoing rate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An app to split expenses and do budgeting, costs 1000rs per year.!! Very bad pricing. Keeping the pricing in par with OTT is absolutely ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"it's easy app for sharing & tracking expenses with friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super app. tension free trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing level of accuracy and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Customer lock in. First keep it free so all start using. Then bring in subscription model. This is the worst trick in the book from a customer stand point. Bring in new features and monetize them instead of exploiting the features that made ur app grow. Insted of exploiting the customers that supported made your app what it is today. You should fire the guy who gave you this idea of menetization. This is sick. Wish I could give -5. I am moving out. Also telling EVERYONE to use other APP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really helpful and easy-to-use. I've used it for figuring out costs in a shared house or for group holidays"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app. been using it for years and has many great options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"top much restriction, the basic functionLity should be free , garbage app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app to avoid hassle of maintaining accounts. would be great if it can be linked to payment platforms like google pay, Paytm etc. even bank transfer (NEFT) would be appreciated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This was such a a great app last time I used it. Now, ads, timers while entering transactions, limits on only three expenses. Majorly aggressive towards upgrading to do the most simple expense splits. Done done done"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome !!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise wallet should not be an option unless BOTH people have set it up. My friend paid me in it and now I can't get the money out. This is a scam. The money sits in the wallet, earning interest for splitwise, until I can use to pay someone else, but I don't want to entrap them either. This used to be good but has gone way downhill, ads interrupting, venmo missing etc, wallet stealing money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible and unusable now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If this was a couple dollars I'd happily pay but as it stands the free tier is unusable without a terrible subscription. Locks you out after a couple of expenses and very basic features are not available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and understandable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super excited Good Great Ok Simply super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app I have ever seen. So nicely and deeply analysed features that you think of requirement and it's there for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Functionality locked behind a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good for daily and travel expenses splits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The whole point of the app is to settle up at the end. Now, after a long trip abroad I need to settle up four different currencies. The app charges money for that. If I had known that at the beginning I would not have used this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too much restrictions without the pro version, ads to add expense, there are better free apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can't use the app without taking subscription. In free version one can add four transaction only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is great, useful to use. I needed some techsupport on a language setting. They replied and sorted it for me within 24hrs. Brilliant stuff. Thanks guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good service. Does what it intends to do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every click is asking for pro upgrade. Can't add more than 3 expenses per day. Better uninstall it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Love this app for tracking and splitting expenses with others. That would have been a 5-star rating. Absolutely appalled at how inconvenient and inefficient the payment process is. They take the payer's $$ right away and then it takes multiple steps and many days for the payee to receive the funds. On top of that, there is a weekly limit for ""withdrawal"" of funds, allowing them to hang onto the funds even longer. Our first AND LAST TIME using the payment feature. Settle up outside of the app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was a wonderful app until everything is locked behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The greed has taken over. This app is no long usable. I wouldn't mind the ads but limiting expenses is too much. Time to go elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app ...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"it's fine"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, even tried out pro on my own but found the features to be lacking. Now they push pro so hard the app is barely usable in free mode. Getting worse, they are hiding the non Splitwise pay options and then forcing you to go through Plaid to connect. Plaid just settled a giant lawsuit about passing personal banking data to third parties. Don't give them your info"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Majedaar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good...now not so much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too many restriction without paying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Brought useless updates where it now limits the number of transactions per day!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for tracking group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for splitting the bills specially while going on vacations with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"genial y senci"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for household, activities, and any other expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super easy and so very convenient to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. really simplifies sharing expenses with housemates or friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Makes outings, trips, events, etc. with friends &/or family much more equitable & easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best way to keep track of expenses when traveling with friends. We love it and works great. Love all of the settling up patient options. Even settle up via cash. So easy to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for recording expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app and highly easy to use. You can even specify which specific people in the group to split a particular expense with. I would recommend this to other users too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Really useful for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for 5+ years and I really loved this app. I shared this app with so many friends. The free features were really good but lately the worst implementation has been applied. I am very disappointed and has started to look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worse app.. at the end we had to settle up the bills by using calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I refuse to use you !!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Es muy buena. Funciona de maravilla. La uso permanentemente con mis compañeros de vivienda"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"they are recommending for paid service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lol for limiting expense entries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing in dollers not in INR"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This really is a brilliant app. I've used it quite a few time with friends on trips locally and overseas and it has become an essential travel tool for me. It's well worth paying for the pro version even if it's just for when you're travelling. It's a small price to pay for a whole lot of convenience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowing for 5 expenses per day is absurd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only ad a few purchases/ day without premium and bombarded with waiting times for not having premium Use Tricount instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are fine, but we can't even add multiple expense for free. Split money much better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grabbing. Has put a bar on no of transactions in a day which is very bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App ever used..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From Best to Worst. Kudos to the Splitwise team for introducing the feature that limits the number of expenses that can be added in a single day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, makes splitting bills & keeping track of monthly outgoings easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes paying for vacay easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very convenient and simple to use for our regular badminton group games. brilliantly designed and implemented"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always asking for upgrade with Pro version. And app not running without pao version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the experience after making it a paid app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"to the extent it is free, it is good otherwise it is too expensive. i think the developer should consider having earn from adds rather than taking money from the users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes flatting easy as"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a daily limit for free accounts. You can avoid this limit by not installing from play store, but instead download version 23.5.1 for Android on APKmirror."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to use any useful feature, and even the feature that is free (splitting the cost evenly for a group of people) is not done well, and the math makes no sense. It says that I owe 20€ to one person, even thought when I count it manually, the amount is much less than that, and then it says that I don't owe anything to anyone else or that no one owes me anything, neither of which is true. Horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become the worst financial app. Use to be good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Was great, limits for free version take away from the experience... I hardly use this app so to impose a daily limit on number of expenses kinda sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use it once a year, now there is a four expense limit per day Back to excel, this app doesn't provide the value for the price they charge."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good app but not really free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made it max 3 expenses for free version. U suck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a nice free app. Now even basic features are locked behind a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Doesn't matter who buys the rounds or dinners on holiday!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great. Easy to manage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It has been 9 years and still love this app. I started using this app fir my Manali trip recommended by engineering students 😅 and in 2024 still using it for my Europe trip and Italian housemates 🤗. I use it for house expenses, trip, lending and simplified feature is great a help."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Somehow the calculations aren't quite right. There has to be more transparency as to how it simplifies group debts. I had a recent group, 5 people, 2 currencies, which somehow didn't tally with our manual spreadsheet cross-check. Other than the accuracy of the calculations in reconciling group debts, it's good that it keeps a log of all entries and corrections separately. It's ability to deal with more than 1 currency is also commendable. Just needs more transparency wrt reconciliations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically unusable on mobile with free version now due to daily expense limit and 10 second timer between expenses, used to be great. Oh well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Now it is not free for more than 4 entries, hence uninstalled. I am ok if they charge or allow pro users only. But that should have been mentioned clearly than stopping in the middle"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"if a person A has to give money to B and B has to give C for the same or different amount for that we should have feature to track A can directly pay to C instead of B"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best, then they added a timed ""Get Pro"" advertisement that was annoying but bearable, now I noticed that they limit the number of expenses you can input in one day and that's unbearable, so I'm moving away as soon as possible, maybe to Tricount or anything else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, even for tech challenged older friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise created a fake venmo address for my friend because she didn't enter in an email address when creating an account. Unbelievably stupid and dangerous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dear Splitwise Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am experiencing with the calculations in my Splitwise account. The amounts seem to be incorrect, and I am unable to determine the exact cause of the discrepancy. Could you please assist me in reviewing and correcting the calculations at your earliest convenience? I rely heavily on Splitwise for managing expenses, and this issue is impacting my ability to track them accurately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wasted app after simple functionality cut off without pro paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very much disturbing. Can't add more than three entry in day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can you provide amount at the expenses list?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most complicated app ever, doesnt keep track of information in the same place so it all ends up a right mess. Completely disconnected experience and very frustrating. Looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I download this app every time I travel with a group of friends. I usually pay the 5 bucks for premium and cancel after. it's worth 5 bucks per trip. the real benefit is that it doesn't matter who throws their card down, as long as they throw it in the app we can just settle up later. and if one person had more drinks or something it's easy to split it by percentage. throw another 10% on their name or whatever to account for a higher spender at a meal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing for premium is bad and premium offers are useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Make fool with subscription charges"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"schlechte app, unübersichtlich und wichtige features fehlen wie z.B. folgendes: es ist nicht möglich, eine bestehende Rechnung nachträglich so anzupassen, dass sie mit einer neu hinzugefügten Person in der Gruppe geteilt wird"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Zhatu app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Needs premium for every expense. Please do not install it. There is an alternative split Karo I use that and it's good. Its not promotion it's just this app pissed me off and I'll ruin this app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for debt management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome. exactly what we need to manager our finances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In free version I can't add more than a few expensess. It makes the app basically useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. My friends and I have used it for over a decade. Everything from traveling to apartment expenses can be tracked easily. I love this app and I recommend it to all my friends. We love you Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just fantastic 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sach a nice app very helpful for spilit payment for day to day life"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is a really useful tool. I've paid for the pro version as I'm not against paying for something I use and find it well worth the money. EDIT: It could be a little clearer that you can change your default currency, but otherwise, this is a great little app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They completely killed the app by making basic functionality limited or available only in the Pro version. It lost the ability to save pictures, even in low resultion, but OK that feature might actually take up a lot of server space. Nonetheless, I wanted to keep using the app for simple expense tracking in trips but now the app thinks I need to pay in order to add more than a couple of expenses. That's insane."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes financial life a lot easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"People....Use settle up instead of splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience so far. Need to pay for everything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 entries can be made without premium which is of no use at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's fabulous app for balance accounts.. management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand it's important for the devs to pay their bills as well but forcing users to go paid by restricting functionality is stupid. Add some features that users will find interesting and make that paid. Then I'll happily take a subscription. Not gonna pay for restricting usage that's already available for free. Time to move away. Worst case, I need to go back to using a calculator and settle bills, which is not really a big hassle if I think about it now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"😅"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"""Disappointing and Overhyped"" Splitwise promises to simplify group expenses but falls short in multiple ways. The app’s interface is cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to track what you owe. Many basic features, like flexible expense splits and export options, are locked behind a paid “Pro” version, which feels restrictive. The “minimize payments” feature often fails, requiring multiple transactions instead of simplifying debts. Notifications are inconsistent and unreliable, leading"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything is good but sometimes people are randomly deleting the groups without prior notice so you won't have any idea of the amount you are owed or have to pay It would be nice to have consent of every member of the group before deleting the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless if you don't pay for pro and not worth upgrading for"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love it and hate it. 😆 keeps everyone honest!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good, but not anymore. Now you can't pay others easily through venmo or zelle. This never should have been a subscription app. You kill the app the moment you try to levy a regular fee and there are other apps that have the same functionality for free. You need another monetization model, like ads or a way to store a balance which allows for loans, like venmo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Way too restrictive with only three expenses allowed to be added per day before having to pay. Will look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very useful and helpful app... especially for flatmates and regular traveller groups and all other group arrangements who want to keep their math straight about expenses and it's distribution...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asks you to buy pro for simple task. Not worth it. Deleted it in 20 minutes. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME EVEN DOWNLOADING IT."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"30€ im Jahr - komplette abzocke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and easy to use! Helps my BF and I split our household bills with ease!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"awesome app.. so comfortable for our trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app to use when travelling with a large group of friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bakwas very critical and Confused don't download"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for tracking expenses and split bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting expenses is a terrible feature forcing people to get Splitwise pro. I'm all for keeping advanced features behind a paywall but blocking basic features so it annoys you enough to pay for a subscription feels predatory. Nothing a little spreadsheet can't do to address this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Doesn't work unless notifications are enabled. This gets deleted ASAP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good tool although not always intuitive to use and could use some extra functionality. However, it's helpful regardless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"seamless and slick"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app for rent,, expenses sharing with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they asking for paid 😔😔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good to keep tra ck of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"it makes sharing expenses and paying easy. It's great that you can pay through the app now as well. Only feature I am missing is to do paid by more people through percentages instead of amounts."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using Free Version Works Great! using it to keep track of Household expenses with room mates and split bills while travelling with Family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App to manage your expenses with partners."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free tier is punishing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very convenient for splitting large expenses especially when in large groups. used it for years now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits the amount of transactions you can log unless you buy a premium subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app! It's easy to use, and makes holiday administration an absolute breeze."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Guys don't pay single penny for this waste app. Open chat gpt create a thread for payment each time when you add money ask it to keep in memory it will give exact amount. Soon this app will disappear if they ask for premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payments to me constantly crash. It enabled payments to my PayPal account without notifying me it would do so. No response from support. Very unimpressed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never charge for something that was free before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too limited on the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After they added maximum payments per day uninstalling this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"To good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and has multi currencies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Functionality is fine but the level of ads makes the free version of the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lodu ho tum lodu...bs bhik mangte rgo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately they now force the user to pay for premium, will now seek and use another app too bad..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a feature to send back the money people owe me after two weeks does not make any sense. Just use venmo and not this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Limiting only 4 expenses per day by forcing to get splitwise pro is very bad. We studied mathematics in our school, will count overselves."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is useless, and the Pro version doesn't have that added value for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience with the free version. Limited to 3 expenses PER DAY! Also there's a 10 second timer between each expense!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to organise multiple expenses amongst family or friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great but now it is not, there is an add before adding up a new expense, and there is a short limit of expenses you can add everyday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"remove 3 expenses daily limit the was used to be good bug not anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Traveled to Europe with 13 friends and this app made it so easy to settle dinner and tour bills. Highly recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Allowed too few expense entries so forced to upgrade to Pro but can't get past the password. Tried to reset the PW even buy still no luck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became pretty much unusable without premium, and that in turn is ridiculously overpriced for what the app does"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such an easy way to keep track of money owed in a large group of people over a period of time, like a vacation!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited transaction per day socks. bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is a fantastic app to help settle up group expenses. However, the free version has now completely lost any functionality as you can only input 3 expenses per day. £3.99/month or £40/year is way too expensive for an app that is supposed to help with budgeting!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always badgering about pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"app worth downloading 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"If only splitwise stayed the way it was😑"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super helpful and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on how many expenses to add is very bad. Switching to Google pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than one expense a day without getting a pro license."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I found it difficult to use when dealing with both dollars and Euros, and awkward when a payment was not split equally. At the end of the trip a spreadsheet was easier and more transparent and I could translate the bottom lines into into one currency."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number of expenses for free users. Bad pricing model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After adding an entry, why am I unable to add a new person? Stupid app. I'm not paying a annual subscription to face such pointless limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful! I love all the different built in ways to split things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limited number of expenses for free user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most core feature is paywalled now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes group trips and group spending so much easier to settle up!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is broken. Cannot add any source it always goes immediately to pro purchase. Boooooo....... Edit - i upped my star rating from 1 to 4 for two reasons. 1 being that the development team did reach out with options and tentative fixes pretty quickly. I appreciate the follow up truly. 2 once it stopped prompting me to go to pro I was able to get a card added. Not sure if it was a timing thing or a reset on the support end. Either way I'm in!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads asking you to purchase the pro version render the free version useless, I cannot move past the ad no matter how long I wait or if I close the ad, or close the app I get the same ad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My banks fraud squad shut me down as soon as I made 2 Splitwise payments in quick succession. So much hassle involved in sorting it out. Apparently your open banking system is a big soft target for scammers. I have now removed my bank details for the time being. You must be aware of this threat according to my bank. B.R. Trevor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a lifesaver!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max 4 entries per day for free users .. terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool. Especially in larger traveller groups, the app safes plenty of time and transactions. On my device, the app runs smoothly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No option to select payee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app..can't ask for more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"works great if you have Venmo connected! have not tried other forms of payment but you can also track cash payments you've made/received"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"does as needed! simple to use and is very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Reduce your fees! It's very high as I use this app only twice or thrice a year. Instead of making it subscription based. Make it a one time purchase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Craxy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Now it is buggy, counter-intuitive, and frustrating to use. Now given up after several irritating experiences with it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entry of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The free tier is very limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years until they decided to limit free version to 3 inputs per day. Time to find a new app for settling expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No proper upgrades but asking Pro even to add more than 5 entries.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful for calculating bills on family trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to track shared expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Abysmal. Everything is hidden behind a paywall now. Absolutely disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app. Use it to share household costs with 2 roommates. I use it on android and my cousin on ios. He tells me the app is pretty rough on ios if you don't pay for features. Personally I can't complain but it does tend to be pushy for a pretty basic functionality. I'd buy if it was a onetime lifetime purchase but I won't subscribe for ""divide by"" math 4/5 functionality (dividing costs, upload photos of receipts) , - 1 for pushiness about subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined a perfectly good app. One time payment was acceptable but the subscription fees are ridiculous. Will be looking for a FOSS alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Borderline unusable as a free app, now. Requires payment after entering a couple transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for sharing bills, splitting tabs, just about anything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"forced me to merge accounts to join a group, totally unnecessary data grab, there are way better options for good split account apps. Oh have I mentioned unnecessary annoying notifications? Send me a notification if you made your app user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful on an international trip with 4 friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate the new rule that you can add a few entries a day. I'm looking for an alternative unfortunately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a big fan, now the non pro restrictions have made it an absolutely useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of vaycay expenses! 10/10 would use again and recommend to anyone looking for an easy and effective way to keep track of expenses between friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits you to 3 transactions per day, unless you pay for PRO. Definitely moving on to alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to use , Pata nahi kya babsir bana diya hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible cheap poor owners pushing for pro payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Worth it app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application. Very powerful. Simplify expense tracking for trips with family and friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad 👎 service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The not so new update absolutely sucks. Free tier is useless now that you can only add 4 expenses a day. So unethical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Only thing I don't understand is why the payer updates that he's paid. I feel this should be done by the payee. Closing out the transaction seems like something that the person who is owed money should do when they are paid. like confirming receipt of funds. Otherwise great app. Cheers team"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very and useful and effective"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful to track and split expenses from events and friend groups outings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of the app since a daily limit was introduced for adding expenses. Pro tip... Sideload the old app before they added this ""feature"" works just as before 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy premium and limited the number of entry."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and fast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use...love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes life on group trips a lot simpler."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a fraudulent app. Do not use it for money transactions. They are holding the money and not giving options to transfer others and the transfer to bank is giving error as well. The option to refund the money back to the sender is also not available. My money is caught up and nothing works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to share expenses between a group of friends - no more cash kitty from now on!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total trash Impossible to calculate the shares first to make total amount updated with the sum of it. I always need to know the total in advance 0/5"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best expense app in store simply amazing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, but it has declined in quality. The daily entry limits are too restrictive for practical expense tracking. There are better alternatives available in the app store these days."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, economical (ie, inexpensive), monthly subscription. Worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now we cant add more expenses for free. Rubbish app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Easy to use and helpful in our daily life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool. Your pro subscription costs the same as Netflix in my country. Big barrier to entry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but now there is an add after ever expense, and a limited number of expenses each day. Unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a pretty great app for tracking. Emphasis on WAS. Now you can only add a handful of expenses before they lock you out and require their ""Pro"" subscription. They also make you wait a 10 second timer before adding each expense unless you have ""Pro"". This isn't how it was before, so it's pretty scummy business practices to change it to be predatory like this, after all this time using it. Time to look for alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best apple for split or dutch !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good aplication...unforgunately limited in free mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It works very well to split expenses on a trip or daily for two or more people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The only reason why this app became famous was because it was free of cost. Now they have started charging their customers, so it is time to switch to other apps like splitkaro which provides similar UI and are free of cost. Reply to Splitwjse revert dated 22 October - If I am on a trip than 4 entries per day is not sufficient. Also, there are multiple apps that provide the service free of cost and hence it is better to switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great to use when spending in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Getting worst now a days asking pro version while adding"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is useless. So will not try for paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for flatmates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall for adding more than 4 transactions per day, and ad pops up all the time. Will be looking for alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"U finished the app after adding nuisance ads and Pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Works well but too expensive ($5/month) for what it does."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add all expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good... 👍🌹"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until they started hiding basic, regular features behind a subscription wall. Even some premium group features don't work unless *everyone* in the group has an active subscription. Dropping money on this greedy app (even as a trial) was an unfortunate waste."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice 👌 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What were you guys even thinking with the limited 4 free expenses per day???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be really good app to track money owed betwee friends, but as l've been using it they started implementing a progressively worse free user experience. There were occasional ads to upgrade to their pro version; but now the ads appear after every expense added (additional 10 second wait to add an expense). Worse still they capped me to only add up to 4 expenses per day, and suggested to wait until the next day to add more. Would not recommend, look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's nice app thank you developer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works well and the free version is fine if you don't have too many expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"First time to use it. Found it to be a very useful tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great little app! perfect for friends sharing dinner, lunch, trips and activities together!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be brilliant! But ever since they added a transaction limit, I have been looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of THE best travel apps for group trips! Super organized. Can split transactions in percentage or dollar amounts. Can settle balances through Venmo or Zelle. Pro version gives you even more options. Can attach photos of a split bill so everyone in the group can see. Been on 5 group trips with this app and it's so worth it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Did not add expenses when splitting. Not worth the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You can't do anything without the payed version anymore is basically unusable without the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable because of user-unfriendly and plain greedy limitations of free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"OH. MY. HEART!!! THIS APP IS AMAZING!!! Friend group went to Disney last year. What a pain to keep track of what everyone owed everyone else. Same group went away for a weekend, but one of us had heard about Splitwise. It's worth a shot, we thought. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Download this app. You will not be sorry!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app makes you intentionally wait for 10 seconds before you can add an expense, unless you buy the premium subscription. A limit of daily expenses is reasonable, but intentionally wasting time is not."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do yourself a favor and use another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have provide a suggestion that there should be some restrictions settings for the group. E.g if I added an expense it should be edited n deleted only by me. If if another group member is editing or deleting it it should restrict him or it should ask approval of the person who added that expense. Used case scenario is like there is always a friend who is messing around with the things for the sake of joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive and convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses a day limit made this app from perfect to unusable. L + fell off + already found an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless nowdays"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app Very helpful in trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"gating basic features behind a paid subscription killed this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great to settle bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number of expenses to add.. lol as if there are not enough free alternatives to this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be functional but now the ""free version"" does not let you add more than 3 or 4 transactions within 24 hours. It's a real shame because it used to be useful for splitting holidays/gifts etc. and I would have recommended it to everyone if it stayed as it was before. However now it's utterly useless, there's constant ads and you need to pay in order to use it even for just one occasion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a great app to track expenses among groups accrued in trips, but the recent update limits 4 transactions per day makes the app unusable and is pure frustration. Would no longer recommend this app and is searching for alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant way to manage group finances when you're on holiday. so much less hassle!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Paid app if you want to add more than 3 expenses in a day...are you serious"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was my previous comment ""Some of the best apps I've ever used"" Unfortunately me and my friends moved to Settle Up after the App became paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good. easy to use. but hope to generate pdf file for report so it can open the report on phone without specific app to open cvs export file"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for travelers and friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits, upsell screens, limits, upsell diamonds and in general really obnoxious free tier. The solution? A monthly subscription for what can be essentially solved by a shared spreadsheet. Stay away, convenience is gone, app is cooked by investors and will only get worse as they squeeze to get more of their investment back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app before it got paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The most useful app every made for sharing expenses and the customer service is amazing !!! I had some problems in figuring out stuff and they were so quick in helping me understand and figure out things !!! 🙏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My current trip is the last time I'll ever do a Splitwise. Been using it for a few years and this delayed Add Expense feature and only adding 3 expenses a day limit is getting ridiculous. Now I have to pay $5/mon for the previously free tier features?! Nah, I'm deleting after my trip and downloading Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After new max 4 expenses policy app has became useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since it is limited to a number of expenses per day, I refuse to use it, as there are plenty of apps with the same purpose and functionality that do not have these limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"the app is okay but it would be nice to know which items have been paid off for record keeping rather than keep a running total"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Time saving... and very helpful. Keep all the record."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app. Very efficient and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It shd be made simple for sports sharing by 4 Badminton a Players who play irregularly and contribute in different propotion"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can add only 2 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined the app with a 4 transaction daily limit. What is the point of an expense app with a transaction limit?! Why is there a subscription to have unlimited? Why is this not just a 1 dollar app?!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Another case of ""why are my entries now capped at 4 per day?"" Looking for another app, this just ain't it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Generally just rubbish. Nothing added up properly, stated owed more than it worked out. Will be uninstalling this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can't be serious. Are you really that greedy to the point of making the app unusable in the free version? Are you that desperate? It used to be great, now you have to pay 3 euros per month to log more than 4 entries per day. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"now become useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable without pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There is a ridiculously low limit on the number of expences you can add on a free account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app just keeps crashing and not even opening. It is showing try to update as there is a bug. But there is no update available in the play store for the app. Kindly fix this issue asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant app! Excellent for shared holiday expenses. Love the ability to split bills unequally between different people in a group. This app has saved me so much time (and probably money)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. Earlier it used to be very smooth to add and keep track of all expenses. Now all they do is running after money for everything, you cannot add more then 3 expenses, if you want you need to subscribe...so we need to pay now just to track our expenses hahahaha"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful unpaid experience. Crab dancing huh??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Con - Limitation of adding no. of daily item."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor business practice taking the most basic functionality away from long time users with no announcement or warning beforehand. the Pro version with month fee as much as Netflix is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grabber"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All things premium and Ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Costly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update killed the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app. helps me keep track of all my transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The Ads killed the App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to love this app, but the stingy daily expense limits and ridiculously priced subscription has me looking for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription model for a payment splitting app. Not worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Always asking for payment. There should be usable free version. Not everyone is interested in subscription as common people use it sparsely. It's better to do it excel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant and easy to use 👏 👍 😀"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am using this app since 2018, but now they put the limit for 4 enteries per day for non-pro. It is useless now, will find another options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 3 expense allowed per day. Such capitalistic move. I am leaving this app for this reason!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing to enter details only showing to login pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad Y"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Could Introduce adding at least 20 free splits for longer list of expenses such as trip expenses etc. need to wait until next day to add pending splits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to share expenses with friends while on vacations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome application developed to manage all expenses.......am using it since 2017."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To the dear product team at Splitwise, Understand your target audience, it's primarily bachelors living on tight budgets. Do you think I'll pay a subscription fee for this basic service. IITians will come up with umpteen number of knockoffs for you guys in days. Your days a re numbered if this model continues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses a day?! What a joke. No way this is worth what they're charging - they should have found a better way to monitise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and extremely useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An app asking for the last 4 of a users SSN? Are you kidding? No thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app to travel with friends to keep everyone fairly split with what they owe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be good, but now it is the most akward unusable app i have ever used. Everything is behind a paywall now for no good reason they could have easily made this app pay with a 0.1% payment transfer fee or something instead of a subsciption that costs a rediculous amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use Splitwise whenever I travel with friends or family. It does all the math for you! The upgraded platform is great when you're traveling overseas, so you don't have to do the conversions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please remove paro option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was a good replacement of traditional splitting. But now they have gone greedy for a simple application which do as little as maintaining an excel. Why should I pay as much as 150 per month for a normal excel at which I can get Netflix. Please don't install this app, instead use the non premium ones like splitkaro and others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a free app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using it since college to make people pay up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't pay money for basic arithmetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good until they set up limits for splitting transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Is not working properly. Previous visible features are not working now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not showing individual expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Everything is premium. No use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easiest way to manage finances in a group of people!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't download this app. Too much limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a good app, but now the free tier is very limited, such that is useless. You should either pay for the app or find another one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit, and the actually forced delay to add new items, are ridiculous. The subscription is incredibly expensive. Should offer a one-time payment and would have considered. Recently started using a competitor and have been much happier. Can't recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes group trips so easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app...idk whose brilliant idea it was to make us keep waiting 24hrs to add only 4 expenses. Would give negative stars if that was an option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't support offline split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful and easy interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"just love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Limit of transactions to add. Excessive ads. It was better before, as of last year December. Now it's a disappointment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"does what I need it to and it's easy enough to figure out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They are now take money to add items more than 4 in a day. Disgusting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've previously used this app a lot, however recent changes (locking previously available features behind pro version, implementing literally just waiting 10secs to add an expense on free version, daily limits?!?!) have made this app unusable. Even worst - in its core its a very simple app and can be easily recreated with chatgpt in few hours - doesnt really bring anything ""new"" or ""revolutionary"". I'll be deleting it and creating my own free version of it. Good job for killing the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Best...... Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"makes holidays with friends so much easier. really recommend this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very convenient, even my mum uses it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best shared expenses app I have used so far"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great way to not sweat the money during a group trip. it sorts itself with no hassles. all completely transparent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash now with the 3 expenses/day limit for non pro users (more with watching ads/waiting, I'm not bothering with that)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Arsh se farsh pe . From sky to the floor... What a waste app now, which used to be a gem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Most useful application while you go along with others. it saves time and energy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lol app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The total settelup is completely wrong"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be an awesome free tool but the recent restrictions of 3 transactions a day unless you buy the Pro Package is abhorrently greedy. Plus you can't go 2 seconds without a forced 5 second add to use it anymore. It is so frustrating that such a great app decided to screw over their users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful at free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gouging users to upgrade to Pro, by making the free version virtually unusable with the daily limit on expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a gr8 app but now limit to only 4 entries a day (free tier) has become a big burden to carry as i tend add expenses for trip at once. Now me and friends considering moving from this app. 😕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can barely do anything on this app without paying for it. I don't want to pay a monthly subscription for a glorified calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I think it's one of the most functional and used apps for an everyday Indian! brilliant idea materialised into a seamless experience 😁 thanks a ton!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quick, easy way to track shared expenses. Great for group trips!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good!! Although a little bit expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Used this on a few lads trips with 7 of us splitting costs. Works like a dream!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great app to get cumulativel amount of money to give or take among multiple people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful application when you live with neighbour"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to let me add all the transactions and now I have to pay to add all the debts. This is ridiculous, specially after you were with them before they change their policies."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst App for Expenses. They got too greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An app that was the most popular but didn't do anything to improve on its popularity. No proper way to manage recurring payments; no other currencies except USD! Pathetic. Settle Up is much better and has everything I'm looking for"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a premium plan is ok, everyone wants one and it's fine. But forcing me to pay with a small limit of expenses is very stupid when the only thing that you offer is basically a calculator. I'll find alternatives at this point"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App for Accounting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best one, now became useless!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app to split bills and collaborate your spends. Sucks now. Basic Functionality is not free. Only 4 entries free per day. People pay for add-on features not something which is supposed to be the VERY basic usecase of such an app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, the nag screens were annoying but now it's added limits to how many expenses you can add per, making it useless without pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good and systematic app to record payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Add new feature for sponsar trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this for more than 5 yrs already! But recently they added Pro option which is sooo expensive and the regular one is now very limiting. No compassion for loyal users, which is just sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed that adding expenses is restricted to Pro users. I'd rather watch ads to access this feature than be forced into a subscription. This limitation makes the app less convenient compared to others. Edit : I request you all to please consider an alternative like Splitser. 🥳🥳"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice and easy to use app. simplifies effort to manage group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"an easy to use app great for tracking payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limited entries is such a fail on this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a user since 2015, along with all my friends. However it is now unusable and it's forcing to buy subscription. Will be moving to some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a really great app until the limits took over. Spare yourself the effort and look for something else. Even Excel will do better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now with the daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of expenses is ridiculous imo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not really enjoying it now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now they just want your money with splitwise pro. Ads every time you want to add an expensive, and a limit of 5 entries per day. What?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very basic features are now paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Make unlimited entries free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise value came from being slightly easier to use than a spreadsheet. Now you are limited to 4 transactions a day unless you pay for pro. Just use a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Latest update disabled Pass code unlock and Biometrics based security is not getting enabled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"एप का साइज 64 mb है जो कि इन सामान्य से कार्यों के हिसाब से काफी ज्यादा है।"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not use. If on a trip, you'll be cut off after a few entries. Pay, or find a different way to track. So just use a different way to track."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They made it paid and making to wait for 10 sec. Huge turn off"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise does a great job of tracking expenses but it was disappointing to discover that multiple peer-to-peer payments couldn't be passed through without having to open accounts with each one. Our group reverted back to writing checks to settle. We could have done that without Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable without Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ton of ads and limited transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is helpful to manage expenses in best manner, it is more helpful for group trip expenses and provide accountability."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Hi pp uu jhjngutiiikkjymikuu ठीक है मैं तुम्हें देखूंगा"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love it. easy to use all in one product. it is one of my favorite app when travelling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"reliable and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very nice apps..i have been using the apps since foerever...eventhough the latest one need to paid...but it's worth it..tq"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become damn near unusable after the premium subscription changes. You can only do THREE expenses per day for free, and the 10s breaks between them just advertising the subscription is wild. You might as well just make it a paid app and get rid of the free version at this point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't settle a specific individual expense which should be a basic function."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"""THE"" Must Have App for Group Travel!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good upp until devs enshittified it to force you buy the premium subscription to insert endless payment to your group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"having a cap for adding expenses is stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic changes in the app... only 4 free transactions a day and filled with ads...premium charge is a bomb ..took away all the convenience...big thumbs down...will switch to something else ...bye bye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting addition of expenses to 4 per day + 10s wait to add expense is crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Cool, very useful, NO need to manually calculate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Wish it would automatically settle up when euros/dollars are used instead of counting them as 2 separate logs. otherwise, great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"making trip expenses with groups SO simple!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the handiest most useful app you could ever get."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for managing trip finances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Glorified calculator with a fee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"If you aren't premium works terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Direct asking for paid package, not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente para división de cuentas con amigos. Funciones muy avanzadas y muy intuitivo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useable without spending £30 a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be best app but due to its limited entry it has become frustratinh and waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was at a time the best app to track expenses amongst a group. But now since they have introduced limited entries per day, it has lost its credibility. Would recommend using other better apps such as settle up etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit for free plan should be increased. Uninstalling this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free alternatives out there that do the exact same thing, only better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much is behind the paywall, too complicated too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the heck is limit on expenses? No use wastage app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For F's sake Either let it be free or make it completely paid Don't tell me after I've added so many expenses that now start paying, I'm not gonna pay because of your cheap tactics, otherwise would not mind, will move to some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful for splitting expenses especially overseas with currency conversion. Reasonable monthly prices with no hidden fee or traps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is ok, but I can never transfer my money out from Splitwise pay, always failed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be an excellent app. It has now gone the way of removing features unless you pay. Seriously! I cannot add more than a few expenses unless I pay for splitwise pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2014. Now, it has lost its relevance and usability while pushing for pro subscription. Moving onto other apps as it's just not worth it. Charging ₹1k/yr for services is just shot in the foot for them. RIP. Karte rahiye paywall, khelte rahiye paywall, alooaaa paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and convenient way to track and share expenses?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free tier isn't usable, it present too strict limitation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great way to split bills. takes some time to get one's head around it, but otherwise good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a shame that I am rating this app with 1 star. I used to love this simple group expense manager. Now it allows only 4 expenses per day in the free tier. On top of that you have to wait 20 seconds to add your 3rd and 4th expense. This is really nasty🤢. The paid tier is so expensive that it isn't worth the cost. I am already looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now, there are lot of ads and you can not put more than 5 expense. Now it become worst app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So much easier than putting one person in charge of calculating all of this when a trip is done (usually me !😂). Did need to upgrade to be able to enter more than three expenses per day; so far, it's been worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally there's nothing much to this app , Anyone with basic app making knowledge can create app like this Splitwise used to be my first preference but now I'm moving out of it, because of their purchase model instead of earning through ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just cancelled my subscription. I only subscribed originally because I already had everything setup to split the bills each month. I saw Splitwises' feedback to adding expenses when the 4 free daily expenses limit is renewed....who in their right mind is remembering to add expenses the next day? That's the whole point of this App, so we don't forget and know how much is owed!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very nice 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this is the best creation ever! it even works with foreign currency and convert everything to a single currenxy at the end. incredible. it allos you to also attach receipts. Basically everytjing you need to keep track of expenses. I love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Developer switched to a subscription model for a really basic app. Avoid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only utility this app have is gone. Limiting the number of transaction to upload"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is really a very useful tool. You can split the expenses in any sort you can imagine. There no chance of messing up. The statement email at tha end of the month is a really an awesome thing. Hats off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"All are great and worth for 5 star rating however removing 2 stars for making User Experience bad with ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"this is unfair to push users for upgrading or expend money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was the best until you got greedy and only allowed a couple of entries per day, pushing to go ""pro"""
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a good app but now they think we would spend a monthly fee for this. I could purchase this app for 2-3€ but a monthly fee is crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good but now the free user experience is awful. Switching to other apps such as tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally unusable without paying. Like one of the main features of uploading a photo of the receipt requires a subscription. Can understand why AI transcription of the receipt would cost something, but not just uploading the photo. Find something else, there are better apps out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Features which were originally free and not restricted under ad usage are now being restricted to the paid only service. You can only input 4 items a day now. I used the paid service for a year and didn't find it worthwhile for what I needed and now that I can't afford to pay for the Pro the features we originally had access to for free are being taken away. Hopefully there's another alternative for us to switch to because this is excessive greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A really good app me and my friends have used for years ruined by greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expecting us to pay for upgrade for using basic features like adding more than 4 expenses😂.... moving on to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to settle bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only log 4 transactions per day. Have to wait until the next day to keep logging transactions, or pay $5/month for ""pro"" features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For the free version, they've added a limit to how many expenses you can add in a day, along with long ads after adding expenses. It used to be a great, very handy app, but now I'd recommend using another one, unless the pro features are something you're really interested in. For basic expense splitting, I can't see a compelling reason to use this one anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app!! makes traveling with a group so much easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too many brians"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Latest update issue: incorrect calculation when splitting amount among multiple people. Workaround: select all checkboxes, then deselect all, to get accurate calculation. Please fix."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great app. shame they reduced the transactions to only 5 per day in the free version, kind of limiting for those who only do grpup trips once in a while."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really helps manage household bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"muy util y sencilla"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app - so flexible, easy to use and saves so much time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is no longer usable so moving away from this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No use of this anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Your greed has been increasing day by day. You keeps taking away necessary features and allocate those for pro users. Do you really think mass people are gonna pay $5/month for occarional group trips?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Make it a one time payment app, subscription model on a expense tracking app is diabolical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for family holidays."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free app is useless now. I'm not paying a subscription for something I use twice a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app now. Everything is paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"extremely useful. irreplaceable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent service. easy to use. fair to all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useful for splitting cost for a group. We found that some people paid $45 as their part and others paid in $170. It was all screwed up. This is the second time we used it for splitting up for a group party. Never again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a great bookkeeping app. Allowing my friends and I to log our expenses while also noting that I got only a 3 dollar coffee whiley friend got the 30 dollar steak deluxe. Now they only allow 3 transactions a day which kills the reason for a book keeping app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"there is a limit of very few expenses per day. or they force you to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ads plus has stopped supporting free addition of expenses now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"ADs are showing constantly and the algorithm to split payments is bad. People have to do payments even if it could be distributed more efficient so there are less payments in total."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"no of expenses per day is limited without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fame got to their head and they become too comversome for a simple app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"khatarnaak"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great work guys"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app for splitting payment on trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a really good app to track money owed between my partner and friends, but as I've been using it they started implementing a progressively worse free user experience. There were occasional ads to upgrade to their pro version; but now the ads appear after every expense added (additional 10 second wait to add an expense). Worse still they capped me to only add up to 4 expenses per day, and suggested to wait until the next day to add more. Would not recommend, look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm trying to pay for it because the free version is very limited per day but there's a mistake in the checkout. So it's useless. I have to download another similar app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Right"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app when you are travelling with friends, you can simply calculate everyone's share easily. Overall easy to use and best spending tracker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Enshittified by limiting its one main function. Limiting expenses listing makes the one reason I got this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this is a good app for keeping track of your expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unacceptable to limit the number of expenses that can be added per day. I don't usually leave reviews to complain but this is really unacceptable. Make the app only available after payment with a trial period if you want but don't try to make it look like there is free version of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You really are scratching the bottom of the barrel with daily entry limits and 10 second ads in between entries for the free version. What the developers should have done with these updates is add some basic calculator functionality that has been lacking for so many years. But no, greed wins..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has been enshitified! Dont even bother installing this app, just look for other better alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's not usable anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The version with ads is practically unusable, okay if you pay for it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best way to keep track of family expenses and maintaining the peace between everyone! We love it! Trips are no longer a stressful spending ordeal. So happy we found Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes group splits super easy. Does exactly what it should"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy and practical"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant service.. been using it for years now.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super easy to split group costs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was better till they forced for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it! Such a great app. We use it on all our trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"develop design please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dropping to one star from previous five star rating. Introduction of limits makes this app basically unusable at free tier for active travelers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is really superb for tracking trip expenses with multiple people. However, they have decided to cripple the free version so much that it's useless unless you pay for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It doesn't let you add more than 3-4 expenses, no summary for today expenditure and your summary in it. Your revenue model should be based on adds noone will pay for simple calculations and there are reputative alternatives that are free of cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient for group trips! I use it every time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"app is good, the new limits on adding expenses is very less to actually be useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are asking money to use this after 2 transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Search me in google skylimits furniture visakhapatnam"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be free, now changed to ""freemium"" in a very annoying way. You can input a limiter number of expenses a day? That's a very werid limit. My use case is private and very small, so it does not justify recurring payments. It's too bad, cause the app itself was good, but I will move to a different app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good way to share the costs fairly, worked well for us."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I've used this app for many years, mainly to track expenses in my household and to keep a running balance of who owes who, so I only have one, maybe two transactions per day and the free version works great for that. Went on a trip recently and used the paid version to keep track of expenses split between five people, and of course it worked well for that but at $5/mo on a consistent basis I don't believe it would be worth it. Not enough functionality to justify the price."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing and I regularly recommended it to friends whenever we would go on trips. Now it's barely usable with daily limits on listing expenses, waiting times and extortionate subscription price. What a shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now without the premium version cannot be used. 1 star"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to keep track of expenses over a certain period, and then settle up who owes what."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The services provided is not worth paying a subscription service for. Even a one time paid version would have been acceptable but I guess the Devs got greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best option to split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It is an awesome app for group plans."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just not worth it after the recent updates. The daily transaction limit alone takes it down to one star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool for trips and other expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is a useful app. But the limitation of transaction registration has become a problem for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Negative marking should be there ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App ensuring compliance of all issues related to expenses helping friends to know full details of expenses done and who owes whom how much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting the entire functionality of the app behind a paywall is just greedy and dishonest."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free (with Ads). The subscription and monthly fee are unwarranted for something as basic as adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app have limit for day and too many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app. Simple interface with great functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"works great. so easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, does as needed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent for tracking and simplifying group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is Completely unusable and the cost of the pro version is extortionate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"a version in English please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very high premium amount and free version is not so easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most of the features are now locked behind pro, the free version is next to unusable. I understand they could use some profit from this, but not this much! It’s quite expensive especially just for purpose of splitting bills!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"User-friendly app ideal for group activities."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but lately they try hard to force you to buy their paid subscription - the app becomes unusable. Would not recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, the latest updates with the paid fees are making the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes group holidays so much easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic tool to keep track of money paid between friends or family. It was a free service before but only 3 transactions can be recorded for free per person per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for group trips and nights out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's ok but not rocket science, they've got greedy as pro is the only way to add 5 transactions a day. Lots of other apps that do the same thing for free or that you can just buy once. Good app but definitely not worth the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I stopped using the app because they have set a limit of adding just 1 transaction per day. They had such an easy UI and now these ads and nonsense limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app, but it's now useless for adding more than a few expenses a day unless you pay for the premium version. Will be going back to Tricount instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now only limited to 4 transactions a day used to be able to do more on the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ensh1tified - used to be great, but now paywalled with annoying non-close ads and low usage limits. Look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day. Ridiculous. Used to use this app regularly but it is unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day limit is a joke. A quick cash grab to spoil all the goodwill and momentum this has built is the saddest tale of the century. This decision is the downfall of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, slow and max 4 transactions per day on free version. They should update clearly the restrictions on free vs pro app like cap on number of transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit is stupid. Now I have to wait to add another expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would give 5* if default currency option will be provided to dollar or pounds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great Tool when traveling in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seems we have to pay to calculate our daily expenses! This is more like a shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you guys should really need to stop limiting the number of expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very happy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Embarrassing money grab practice that ruined that app. Honestly, how can you coerce people with limited daily expenses into monthly subscription for something that is slightly more advanced that a calculator. Uninstall and never come back, by Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"All I can Say IS Yes I loved the app so much thanks to the development"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, that you for doing it and letting us use it for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like this app it so easy to use just put your amount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"absolutely love it! tried the free version and it was so easy to keep track. would definitely subscribe to the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rate limit sucks, uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used this app for years and loved it. Now they limit the amount of expenses you can do per day without paying. I get they need to make money but $5/month is crazy. At least offer the ability to pay in full. Like every other app that goes the subscription route, deleted. Just switched to Tricount and very happy with it so far."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic limitations to add expenses which were not before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes traveling with friends easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, until they started to limit literally anything you can do on the app. Now it's actually totally useless, moving on to something else. A real shame of what it has come to! I was using this since 2018 and now I have to find an alternative because I have no other choice really."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They destroyed their app by limiting 2 transactions per day to free users! Use settle up, atleast you see and ad and get to add transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a good tool for a group vacation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful app to keep track of payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"can we add the picture of bills or screenshot of payment for more clarity"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really useful for tracking money owed. User interface could be more intuitive but does the job."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dude's ruining their own app !! Wait time for adding entry !! Good Bye 999 INR or 12$ yearly !! Kidding ? Way too much !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use, very handy tool when travelling with friends. love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once used to best app , now unable to even add expense for 3 days, saying message u had reached limit for day. My last amount added is 2 dats before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Instead of making features good enough to justify upgrade. They have made it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rate limits are the worst idea the product team at Splitwise thought of I think. Makes the experience horrible and jarring. Also who in their right mind puts the default and basic usecase of the app behind a paywall. Simply atrocious."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useful if you suck at math"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Group holidays (whether with family or friends) are so much easier with Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A great app ruined because every single feature has become unavailable for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"give me an ad rather than 4 transactions per day limit..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very effective application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense add Karo Direct paisa laaya"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You just killed this app by making it's core paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edited the review, used to be very useful app now they cap the expenses at 3 per day. Stupid app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the new limit on the number of times you can add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has been perfect, but the enforcement to a prime subscription makes it fully useless. More then sad to destroy a fully functional and widely used application with such as decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Basic functionality is okay, but too many paid features and there a lot of free alternatives that offer everything which is behind paywall in Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limit of 2 expenses per day is the worst money making strategy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Due to certain limitations of adding bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent service. payment was super convenient. setup was a breeze"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Redesign the app UI. Feel so old design."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise app , I tell you my experience, used this 2 month then I finally decided to leave this, because when you add more tranjection then it tell for take premium, who is very unusual things, many apps available on Play Store you can definitely check out them, very boring Avoid this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exelent work for track my money when we together"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group tours"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update has ruined adding expenses. I can't even figure out how to put an expense in that only I paid for. Used to be 3 taps and done, now I can't even figure out how to do the exact same thing I've always been doing. Making your free app worse is not going to encourage people to buy your premium app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New monetisation model is bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"convenient!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without subscription app useless. So uninstall this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I don't know why they changed how to input who pays what, but it is horrible now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"problem in loging in"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for common expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very nice app and convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its Great for group contribution track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for funds sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for sharing with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"More restricted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this for years. Having a premium version for extra features? Fine. But actually restricting basic features unless you subscribe? Actually foul. Won't be using this anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"At some point before 2024, they made it so you can only make 3 expenses per day, and wait a couple minutes between entering each expense for the free version of the app. Moving to Splid, as it won't have that restriction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App for Group Trips and Day to Day Expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's OK"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"all are fine"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good app could be more user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Way to restricted in free mode. I used to use this app all the time. Never again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As someone who values being paid for the work I do, I find it only fair to compensate others for their services. That’s why I’m more than happy to pay 30 francs a year (just $2.5 per month, which is less than half the price of a Starbucks coffee in my country) to the developers for an app I use almost daily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally waste if time. Useless app Close this organisation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is terrible as we have to get pro for even adding expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Really missing some basic capabilities like removing a person from a group without deleting the group..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm stuck not able to log in because the app won't let me change my password. It just keeps giving me 'I am not a robot' test. RUBBISH"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I choose Bahrain country for payment and here require 3 digit for fils like 0.000. Currently not able to add 3 digit for fils"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use Splitwise during vacations to track expenses, split them with a group and export them to Excel. The free plan now is unusable. I will not pay a subscription for a service I use occasionally. Although I understand their desire to push free users to become paying users, this renders the app useless for me and makes me despise their business practices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst app to ever exists. It is showing me the wrong amount that I have to pay and it is so stupid and dumb. I hate it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I should not have to pay to add expenses!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is basically unusable and paid version overpriced for a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Excellent app when paid but lousy when it's free. Only can input 3 expenses per day. Recommend to use tricount instead. Same functions but entirely free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, the recent limits on 3 transactions per day make the app unusable, and the monthly subscription model is not something I believe is merited for something I only use once in a while. I would happily pay a one time reasonable fee, but current limits mean I need to move to an alternative product. Sad, because Splitwise is a good product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until they limited the expenses you can add and included a 5 second wait time for each expense unless you upgrade to pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helpful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, now there is a limit of 3 expenses a day, which makes this app obsolent. I will just use shared google sheets, thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful app to split holidays costs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use. all transactions are clearly recorded."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"there should not be functional features behind a paywall. it's not very complex. works greats though 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"asking 1000 rupees for multiple entries uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish that you have to watch an ad to add an expense and that you're limited to 4 expenses per day without Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Just 4 transactions per day 🤦"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"the app is not capturing all the needs, e.g. if one person pays only and the rest of the members are giving money in advance later to cover it, the excess is split between all members and the sums are messed up completely..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye-bye, greedy service. Long time user, but monthly subscription now killing the joy of using this app. Not getting enough value for it when using app twice a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed. Only one data added. App is requesting to purchase pro wise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"""You've reached your maximum number of expenses for today"", after adding like 5 of them. Used to be useful, with this it's 1 step away from being completely usless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is centered around accumulating your personal data. Avoid using this app or sharing any of your personal information. An app that acts as a calculator shouldn't need your financial information particularly when other apps you likely already use have this functionality. Use a calculator and/or venmo/zelle/PayPal/Cash app, you will be thankful later"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It really does make sharing expenses easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star only because of the expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app was incredible. I have used it for many years. They introduced Splitwise pro a little while ago with some additional perks. I didn't need them and was happy to sit through the ads for a very helpful free service. However, now they have limited your daily expenses. I can only add 4 expenses per day before being limited. I understand that everything has to be a subscription service nowadays but this one was just an insult to users who have been around for this long."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great when travelling with a group to keep track of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is Good App. But one things is not right we can use only 5 to 7 Transactions record."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lot of features are being restricted in the free version. App is glitching a lot recently"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This is the real OG product. It's great. But, they screwed up by putting basic functionalities (which were free before) behind a pay wall. Also, a subscription to do Maths? Why did we go to school then?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super easy to track expenses when travelling in a group! My friends and I use it all the time!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"greed won"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now useless without pro ..go for another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using this daily for the past 7 years. It is extremely useful. It also prevents doubt, unhappyness, and confrontation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super practical"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cut all the useless features, make it cheaper and more focused on expense splitting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version now limited to three expenses at a time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's a great way to get the money from a trip and making sure everyone is paying fairly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging way too much for the service rendered."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A shell of what it once was. If they had a reasonable one time purchase option, I might consider sticking around. App is basically unable without a pricy subscription they force on you now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"$5 a month to use something I use once a year? Do my taxes for me at least. Sheesh."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Limited expense entries to like 3 per day with no warning to users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App need some more useful features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"it is one of the best app for splitting the money in group of friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very quality app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great idea, and perfectly implemented"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's easy, convenient and most importantly: not bloated. it does what it should without too many bells and whistles."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"👎🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once a great app, it's gone downhill. They now limit the max amount of transactions that can be added in a day to 3 to get you to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"How the mighty have fallen! They resorted to the worst way possible to get users to purchase their pro plan - nagging. Absolute trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad move to limit transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be fantastic but now has become significantly worse, limiting expenses per day and forcing you to wait before submitting them. This is all done to force you to pay for a premium subscription. Unfortunate companies resort to worsening a user experience instead of offering improved benefits for subscribers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of spends and avoid headaches over sending money back and forth"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App deserves 0 star after they have started asking for money. Started using another app now. Boycott this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Probably a good app with the pro version, but the free version doesn't allow you to do much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only 4 expenses per day plus ads in the free version, pretty sad for such a simple ap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become worst. After you guys added timer and commission for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic version is useless. Pro is expensive for what it offers, as mostly people use it occassionally only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It would be very convenient if mathematical operations like addition woukd be possible in the amount input in the add expense page. Make it very basic without many options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit per-day transactions makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good before.. used to add multiple records, now it's only limited to 4 entries very frustrating ... And even it ask to upgrade to pro everytime u add a record"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience using the app which was once great. I understand developers need to pay bills too, but there are other ways for it than spoiling the user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can add other people.expenses it always assumes it is you that spend the money. Also when trying to split it without a person on a group it does not work and always in includes him/her so not usefull to split expenses when not all.members participate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app during travel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There should be an option not to accept payments through splitwise PayPal or venmo if account doesn't have those stupid things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I cannot add more than 3 entries per day. Need to buy a subscription, and the features aren't even worth it. Absolute bs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are better of using a excel sheet than this waste of space. From pushing ads to sudden eula changes that limits the amount you can withdraw. This app has become more a neucance than a useful tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As essential as my banking, just wish it was cheaper, maybe a student tier or a family plan option would be useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So many bugs and limitation on basic setting like set the dedault currency"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 5 expenses a day, 10sec ads on each expense input. Try Tricount, it's free and way better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really good and free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great. When making a trip with friends, the app has features to cover all our needs. I have been using Splitwise for many years now and have no complaints."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Frustrating to use !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"5i ckfc to 40 Rec I"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without subscription. Hopefully, a new free better alternative comes up soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's a great app for traveling with groups of friends and looking like mature people by not trying to split every bill eating out! yay. also splitting groceries, etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limits number of expenses and spams ads for itself! Garbage app - not paying for an expensive calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever to split expenses with your friends and family. And super easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I'm using Splitwise since 2 years. It's great at the beginning. It's more burden to even have this app. Sorry!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app not working properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Easy to use. Makes sharing expenses stress free!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Add 3 expenses a day. Completely unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Cannot join a group initially, but after some research it works ok."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes our trips with friends much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription model ruined it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too many pay walls in usable and it crashes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Real productive app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"So practical. I don't love the UI but the app functionality is perfect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entries per day or 3€ per month, no thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so helpful for large group vacations and outings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Devs get greedy and ruin a great app. Really ? Putting a limit? Ads don't work?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App made by baniya 🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Broke existing customers by placing surprising limits!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really help us while vacation or hangout . easy to used and easy to divide"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app to help track expenses among friends, colleagues or even family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Price of this is just crazy. There are at least 10 alternatives. I used for sometime when it was not so abusive. Happily deleted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses per day without paid sub"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"After updates, it restricted us"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became a horrible experience when they started limiting expenses to 4 per day. Really terrible way to lose customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed will kill you soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Because of very limited daily expense limit. i'm with my friends going to uninstall this app after 3 years. this app is useless now for me and for my friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it takes the hassle out of splitting costs on trips and means no one stresses that they've overpaid. Pretty flexible in terms of currency, who pays how much etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"add a one time purchase for unlocking unlimited expenses, with no other pro features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. All real time group expenditure scenarios supports this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great experience till now, simple and easy interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad experience. Limited to just 3 transactions per day without letting you know before. Predatory practice to force you to move to pro. Not recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"forced 10sec wait when adding expenses to blackmail you into subscribing. this was once a great app and I would have been willing to pay a one-time fee, but it's simply not worth the subscription, especially not with tactics like these. I have moved to tri count, which I can recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many pop up. Not good. Just a useless app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The seamless experience has now turned horrible, thanks to 4 ad-free enteries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am using split wise from last 2years it's amazing every single entry is saved."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously it was giving 4 expenses free per day and now it is asking to buy pro for a single expense. Fall back newcomers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App became unusable with recent update. Can't even log payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App sucks, need to pay to add more than 5 expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It does what I need so well, definitely a life saver of an app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy and fast to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"user friendly and very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It keeps saying I have reached my maximum daily number of transactions when I have only used like two that day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic features. The group consolidation is really great instead of individual payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately this app barely works.....unless you pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a good app. Takes up time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"honestly when there is nothing else. this is it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version limits how many transactions you can add, then shows an extremely annoying pop-up. If it wasn't for this thing, would be a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very convenient. I'd give it 5 start, but the receipt scanning feature really struggles with anything that's not in English. Also if there are several lines for total, total without taxes, etc., it adds them as items instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"UI feels like if napster era and windows phone apps had a baby. Only using this because my friends use it. For me personally felt highly discomforting barely getting the job done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"5$/month for every member who wants to use the app is just illogical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Bug for years where there isn't a convenient option for members who joined late to be included in group expenses that should be split between all members."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After release of Splitwise Pro, this is no longer a good app. Limit expense record , would rather change to another platform with free record."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"That's an awesome app.. on expense sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst user experience. it used to be good earlier ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer usable after the most recent update. 3 expenses per day is not practical and the subscription fee is completely unreasonable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's quite good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So convenient for group travel!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for group trips settlement of money and to keep track of expenses while enjoying your time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too many glitches in the latest update. Could not add any expenses , even with friends who we have been using this with for a long time. Please rectify the issue as soon as possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"useful app for holiday expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad practice putting a daily limit for spending, only three! It was usually a good app but this got annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible pricing for a basic app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid subscription for an app with no major use!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is an incredibly handy app for managing shared expenses with roommates. It simplifies the often tricky task of splitting bills, whether it’s rent, utilities, groceries, or other shared costs. The app allows you to create groups, add expenses, and track who owes whom, all in a clean and easy-to-use interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Damn good app for a group of people who want to share expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great to keep track of expenses when on vacation with the family. I am also planning to use it to track kids expenses and divide those with their dad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just add nothing more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This the perfect app when splitting expenses between friends or family. My friend and I just had a week in CO and were able to take turns paying for meals or other travel expenses and settle up any balance at the end. servers also appreciate it so they don't have to split checks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to track udhari with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can add only 3 expense without paying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dost ne abhi tak pese nai diye huhhhh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Let's charge for something that was free before. genius."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app but limited expenses per day is really killing its usefulness."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Free version is very restricted nowadays. No search function and limited daily inputs (including a cooldown period between inputs). All quite annoying, but I guess that is the intent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this almost 5 years back.. but now it is very frustrating with many add breaks. I didn't mind to get premium facilities however instead of offering new functions, they started to bother on basic entries to push people to get premium facilities. This does not seem good marketing practice. This way you may lose your potential customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time the screen rotates-the waiting timer gets renewed to 10 sec"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app but now ads are populating on adding each transaction. There is limit now to add expenses. If it breaches, you've to wait for next 24hrs 9nce the limit resets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"An example of an app which used to be the best, but not worth anymore. That's what happens when the owners become greedy. Now you need to pay. It's funny that I need to pay to calculate what I'm paying. There are a lot of alternative free apps which are really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app, hate the Limited number of additions per day now. There's no need for that now after unlimited additions were available previously."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app.. nice ui.. thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nerfing the free tier without telling anyone. Predatory and disgusting business practice. For shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for 5+ years and I stop today as they have programmed new limitations for non-pro users (like waiting 10s before being able to add an expense and having a daily limit on number of expenses added). Totally ridiculous. I can't believe they hired someone to program this into their app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"truly an amazing app with so many free features. essential for anytime you're splitting expenses with friends and loved ones because it let's you relax and not have to keep track of it all in your head."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for friends and roommates. Easy to use & simple!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restricting value to force premium instead of adding value is weak"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Only pro version allows to add expenses without limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to split money 💰"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the best app for split money and know who pay what and how much money you need to pay to others and the others pay to you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If someone needs to be refunded in case of overpayment, in order to get that money back you have to give them ALL your information. I'm talking SSN?, I.D, ADDRESS???, A picture of my face? I'm surprised I don't have to give them my gf and the keys to my car just because some one refunded me money through the app and not a 3rd party. ITS A APP NOT A TRUSTED BANK! THEY DONT NEED ALL MY INFORMATION."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes managing shared expenses go from nightmarish to dreamy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day only makes the app completely useless. I am uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an app that everyone will need in their lives at one point. Thanks to the devs for keeping it free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"nice app but too expensive to buy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible practice to reduce daily addition of expenses to 3 without any notice from unlimited on the free tier. One adds things to their paid subscription not take away from the free version. Terrible business practice. Will switch to another interface ASAP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the heck??? This was our go to app for all vacation for well over the last 12 years. Now it's useless and doesn't work anymore.... Have to wait 10 seconds to add something and after 2 inputs have to wait 24 hours?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do simple math on the app the moment it's split unequally the app does some actual rubbish . Total bill was 2 kd I paid 1.5 and there are people so person a(me 1.5),b (0.5), c ( 0 kwd ). So the app should split that B owes me 0.17 and C owes me 0.67 but the app split the amount from person b as well and owe me too when technically person C should pay me 0.67 and that's it while B pays 0.17 basic calculation the app messed up it only gets it right of everyone split equally trash garbage at math"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has a limit of transactions. Embarrassing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 entries in a day allowed and they are charging unnecessarily high for premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise pay is the worst concept I've ever seen. Additionally, I should be able to see my connections to any other payment accounts under ""Connected Accounts"" but I don't see my Venmo or PayPal linked there. Just needlessly complicated for no reason; I shouldn't have to take 10 steps and waste time to link my bank account. Find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a brilliant app. But with the aggressive pricing strategy have killed the appeal. The team needs to revisit how they monetize thus, because no way I am paying a monthly fee for using a few times a year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit is ridiculous and a monthly fee is too much for just splitting bills. Clearly youre trying to cash in on people who forget to cancel. It's grubby behaviour that's ruining every service these days. Give an option for a 1 off fee and it might be worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really easy to use and convenient! no pay walls or bugs - highly recommend for car pooling!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"There is no better tool then splitwise for what it does."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quick and Simple👌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for a few months and it worked great. The app must have updated automatically because now today I can only upload 4 items and have to wait for ads everytime now. Pretty terrible business model considering what this app does would take about 30 min of coding to make. I wish I could rate this as lower than 1 star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Constantly pushes subscription, and now you can only add 3 expenses a day. Not the end of the world, but highly annoying when trying to settle up after a trip or event. I would happily pay a small onetime fee but a subscription with a bunch of features I don't need is ridiculous. I'll be switching to something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Virtually unusable with the new limit to number of expenses able to be added per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"good for expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Focus on adding MATERIAL UI 3.0 INSTEAD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Had the app for 30 seconds but deleting it because I don't want to have to actually add my friends- I just want to see the split and request myself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best🙌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free to use anymore every action has a 10 seconds ad and it is very limited for free users , going to change to the settle up app. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app until they enforced us to buy premium even just to add more 5 transactions per day. Completely unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This should not be a subscription service. I'd pay a one time price, but $5/month for a service I use a handful of times a year is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed with the biggest unexpected limits reached for today. 0 stars literally fix the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Almost impossible to use without paid subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Crashes when trying to upload payment verification info and desktop site is useless. Also can't update address so having issues with receiving payment. So there's basically no way for me to get my money out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If you are a student in a shared house or flat. Get this app, lifesaver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was trying to take the premium version and the payment doesn't go through."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limited number of items I can add in a day? See you later. I found a free app that works just as well and won't be using Splitwise any longer. Find a better way to earn profit Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Yr payment logs k comment section m GIF ko v access do na, bada maja ayega 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great app to manage expenses with a team"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The number of pop ups that try force you into using pro which is outrageously expensive for basic functionality means I will be switching to a different bill splitting app. Very unfortunate as I used to love this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's good as long it's free and even a 5er would be ok but paying 30 for a household app a year is just plain ridiculous. If I'd pay all these service fees nowadays I'd end up with some 500 euros just for apps. Back in the days you bought the app once for 3 euros and companies still got rich enough. So yeah, long story short..after 3 years Splitwise just stopped working for free and the next thing happening is the uninstall button. What a shame. EDIT: the 4 tree don't work anymore!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I could almost stomach the 10 second ad before expenses, but limited daily expenses? This app has lost it completely in service of a buck"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 expenses per day without paying for the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ahh, app went down in my rating from 5 to 2 *. **Use the Treecount instead** Here’s why SplitW is not good any more: - The app doesn’t allow adding pics due to an error. - It fails to recalculate uneven splits in auto mode. - The app restricts you to 5 transactions; even if you delete some, it still prevents adding more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was working good without pro version. What was the need of this app if I have to upgrade to pro and pay extra for calculating my own unsettled expenses. I would rather calculate it on chatgpt!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, this app has become very restricted due to subscriptions. Have used Splid now and it works exactly how Splitwise used to, would highly recommend that one instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Outstanding app....🤩"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unreasonably expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"works well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only being able to add three expenses a day is pretty unreasonable and really useless for groups and roommate situations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy way to settle differences of the monetary kind."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great now they added payment feature!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this app is great for group trips with shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"RIP to Splitwise, it was nice to have you while we could. Like dang I would just watch an ad every few transactions if you wanted me to, or pay a one time fee, but why would I pay a subscription!?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Insane they now limit the amount of expenses you can input daily without paying for premium. What's the point?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy...convenient..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use this with friends on group trips and it worked perfectly, but now that we can only add 3 expenses per day, the app has become almost unusable. I don't think anyone of us who are splitting grocery bills can afford to be paying $50 a year on this app - corporate greed gone too far"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant....no more trying to work out whose round it is..... When the adventure is over a quick glance at the balance tab and it sets out who owes who to the penny. Would really be handy if you could pay a one off fee for using IE pay per play rather than a monthly fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use if you don't want to assign everyone in the group contact data like emails and phone numbers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall. There's lots of free apps that work better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise used to be my go-to app for expense management. Unfortunately, they bit off more than they can chew. Adding multiple expenses blasts an advert in your face, or simply prevents you from adding them. There are many free alternatives available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use to divide expenses. easily use, user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Glitch aap. Keeps giving wrong anounts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's cute"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App should be free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The presence of a daily cutoff to the number of expenses added in the base version makes the app completely pointless. I understand the need for monetisation, but this level of gatekeeping is excessive, many other features can and should be reserved to the pro version instead. I will not use the application anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can someone suggest alternative for this as it's keep on asking for pro and not able to add expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It works as intended. Pretty good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app. Having to pay to skip ads sucks, but is somewhat understandable. Limiting expenses per day for free users is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowing 3 expenses per day is so not done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for group expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great when it was free, I would even be willing to purchase it, but certainly not pay a subscription fee for a software for which I don't require constant updates. 3 eur /month? Almost half of what i pay for a streaming service?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer useful if you don't pay for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined by their monetisation strategy. Don't bother."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such a stupid decision to only allow a limited number of expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Main functionality is restricted to only pro users. I have been using Splitviser instead of this and it's much better and doesn't have any ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please add feature to scan receipts from an uploaded photo or itemize a receipt without a photo and manual inputs. Frustrating to have to take a photo of a receipt when many receipts are just emailed now. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use, makes work trips easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very smart app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded this again...This is a useful service, but you cant have confusing app that charges for the added stress when it used to be free. Splitwise, pick a struggle...deleting, this time for good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App to split bills or any other money-related activities with a group of people or a partner. Highly recommended, have been using it for years now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Your app sucks! Spent a ton of time entering expenses and they disappeared!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too pricey and has now become a lot worse now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why there is subscription for this app now bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trash that forces you to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth for monthly subscription for this basic calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Becoming a worst app, subscription for what ! Maintaing a simple balance sheet ! Pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"if I had an option to give negative stars I would. who removes the basics functionality and keeps it behind a paywall. how the mighty have fallen."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The transaction limit is a total bummer. The app works well, but this 3 tsx limit paywall is just too great of an obstacle. Maybe an option to watch an ad to obtain more transactions could be added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A 10 second ad after adding in each payment meant this app was pretty much unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used them for years. They suddenly became greedy, wanting to charge both parties just to use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great but now they've introduced a paid tier and ruined it. Having to pay monthly for ""Splitwise Pro"" in order to upload unlimited expenses to a group completely defeats the purpose of the app. I am not paying a monthly subscription to have a mobile app function fully. I won't be using this app any longer due to paywalling the functionality that actually makes this app useful — absolutely idiotic business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not enough allowed expenses. Ill just use notepad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utterly disappointed with the app. Limiting the number of enteries per day was a bad move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too many adds and restrictions for free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Annoying ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application to track expenses with other people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app allows limited entries if not got a pro paid versio."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A wonderful idea with horrible execution, that keeps getting worse. Suddenly changing the pricing model to cap the number of transactions per day with no warning is, quite frankly, unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and previously recommend to friends and co-workers as was a very good app.. But since the addition of a very limited transactions allowed per day and basic features like image upload now being pro restricted feature. And poor receipt scanning with Australian receipts (when tried pro), manually calculating and entering them was faster than fixing errors. I can no longer recommend or continue using this app, moving to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shame on the marketing team who chose the current monetizing strategy, please fire them asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This application caused me to loose lots of money, I am vividly upset due to the loss of money and this app has led me to enter debt. My life is ruined and Splitwise is the root cause of my lifes problems, if this application ceased to exist I would be able to have a future in th industry that can be regarded as the flow of time This app while being made by some superb programmers, falls to the fault of a bad concept which involves a destruction to personal mindests and lives as a whole"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app for groups on vacation and stuff, but the price for premium is really too much. It gave only 5 expenses per day for a group on a non premium app. Would not recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Incredible that such a good app is ruined and forces you to pay. I've been using it for maybe 8 years and now they charge you for more than 4 expenses a day? It is crazy, uninstalled and let's use another, I get the support but even prices are crazy I would not pay more than 3€ a year for this service, there a tonne of other apps that do the same for free. Such a shame to ruin such a good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointment. Features going paid. Functionality is lost. Ads are irritating. Limits on the entry are useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible business practice to blindside customers who have been using this app for years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise works really well!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the subscription update, the free version became unusable. I can't believe they added a subscription fee of €5/month—are we talking about Netflix or what? Wasn't adding more premium features enough, or simply making advanced split a premium feature? This update completely ruined the app; no one in my country uses it anymore with the best alternatives available. Amazing self-destruction, CEOs. It just shows how out of touch some wealthy bourgeoisie are with reality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't Delete account. Can't Delete Contacts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Let's all get an alternative. The app is working poorly if you don't pay their subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very easy to use and makes it so easy to manage spending on vacation! Wouldn't go anywhere without it! 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant way to manage expenses on a trip !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only giving me an option for PRO series and not free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"More like shitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing. The Google integration is awful! I signed up through Google and then I couldn't sign in again using the same method! I had to reset my password and bypass the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is now useless without the pro subscription. Uninstalled and requested for account deletion. :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not suitable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The absolute easiest way to settle up with big groups! Love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yeah they basically shot their own foot, switched to solid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and just works. No bloatware or unnecessary features which makes it perfect. 5 🌟"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses per day is crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"My friend don't want to install this. I can't add them if they don't sign up so pointless for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app. Now completely riddled with ads and limits to daily inputs. Would put 1 star if it wasn't for usefulness in the past. Will have to look for a different app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wants to be more than it is. A useful app, that helps manage group expenses. But one whose monitisation strategy has got in the way, caused it to add too many useless features and now clamp down on the free tier. Having used this for several years of trips. There's now better, simpler, free alternative. Leaving Splitwise without much of a reason to be."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had made the experience very bad. Old free version was very helpful. Would have rated 0 stars 👎🏻👎🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am not going to pay a single cent for a simple excel sheet app. Developers need to get that into their skull."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplifies my life well enough"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad Freemium Plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless since they paywalled basically everything. Will move to spliit, ihatemoney or splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really simple way of sharing costs equally"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An amazing app. Testing pro version in Spain and worked very well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste of memory in your phone It used to be a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless unless you pay them. Not against supporting devs and companies but restricting basic features is just cruel. I guess I'll switch to Tricount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Works well for splitting bills. However now pretty much requires a subscription to use as I did before. Minus a star for that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bout to go make a free competing app because this one is now paid and unreasonable for the service of summing a total and dividing it by the number of people in a group lol."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"4.5/5"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App keeps forcing me to go for the pro version which i do not want. Why offer a service only to be forced to upgrade and end up uninstalling the app. Such a waste of time and effort"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We used this app last year with a group of 6 people when traveling. Although we had more than 4 expenses, we were able to input them without any issues. In fact, this was the best app to use at that time. However, this app is no longer suitable for us because of the number of expenses that will be added. This makes the app somewhat useless unless all of us pay for a subscription model. I hope they change it back someday, but for now, we will start using TRICOUNT, it's free and also splits bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used it for my Family and Friends trip and it works like magic. Basic things that you work out on excel post trips are managed here real time. Shows who owes how much to everyone... Gave 3 star cause it has limits on number of transactions in free module, which is a bummer as you have multiple small spends... Add some spot pricing like xx amt for a trip if you want full features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This saves the angst of keeping track of stuff on holiday. You can choose who you split with and it just keeps the score for you. I use it every time I travel with friends now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app without buying a subscription! Why do we need a subscription for everything these days? This app isn't worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Σου λύνει όχι τα χέρια αλλά και τα πόδια μαζί"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app to make it easy for groups to keep track of trip spend or nights out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version in the past was so convenient and helpful. Not anymore. My complaints have already been expressed by many others so not bothering to reiterate them. If anyone has recommendations, please post!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice Experience.. with this App.. Nice to have this on expenses.. Currency conversation needed.. UPI Integration or.. atleast option to navigate to default payment app with debt amount prefilled to that person recommended!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I travel with a group of friends and it is so easy to put receipts in and shoot them as you go. Then at the end we all settle up. Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So without upgrading to Pro, I can only enter five transactions a day. And three of those come with mini advertisements? Honestly this app gets worse and worse by the day. 3 stars to 1 since all the devs care about is upselling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yeah I don't think making your app unusable as free version is going to make me want to pay you for the premium 🙃"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"You can only add a couple of things before they start asking for a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy for managing and tracking personal debts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful and useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Did they sell it? I have splitwise pro and find the direction of the app to be shady and concerning. I got a notification promoting the Splitwise card! I do not pay to be bombarded with ads of any kind. The in-app dialogs and ux changes to push features have been annoying but not disruptive. But ads in push notifications with no way to opt out without disabling all notifications? Evil They aggressively push features like Splitwise Pay without explaining that you're creating a bank account❗️❗️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Anyone who you want to split with has to enter a phone number or email. Why do you need this information? Just tell me what they owe and I can tell them!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love the app, but the daily free limit of 4 expenses is ridiculous and makes it difficult to use and enjoy now. £40 (a year!) to increase this to a more practical amount of 7 or 8 is way too much. Having been a user for about 10 years it would have cost me £400 by now; well i never would have signed up. I used to be a big advocate of Splitwise but no longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Four entries for free tier. What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Use Phonepe app which is way to use and has inbuild split expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous price LOL"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"intrusive ads and expense limit is absurd honestly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now with a 4 transaction limit per day it's basically just a poor demo for the paid version. Trying out Tricount instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good and very easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"one of the best apps for keeping track of expenses, splitting with friends, trips and costs. The ability to simplify payments is awesome!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful app, especially when traveling with friends. Waiting for Polish language."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth paying for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really helpful and easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was good until they made a limit for the amount of expenses you can add in a day. They actively want us to stop using the app rather than make us pay for pro. I'll better watch an ad if it meant I would be able to have a hassle free experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Really don't I devery re srf"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great for us to track home expenses in South African Rands until my brother accidentally pressed the ""Convert To USD"" and now everything is in USD and can not be undone or converted back to ZAR. The dumbest button you can ever add to an app that works with currency. Other than that the app is great. Just this stupid function..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Equal shares to all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very useful tool. all households should consider using this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use it routinely for splitting expenses with friends. Household expenses with roommates, trips with friends, and couples splitting are all well supported."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They now limit you to only 3 splits a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful choice to limit the number of expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently limited free users to 4 transactions per day. I've been using this app for 8 years and now they've broken the basic functionality of this app. The monetization strategy has gotten too far. Time to uninstall and find an alternative that let's you do the most basic function without paying. Really disappointing. Will be moving friends and family off this app too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So much greed for money, that you guys had to disable the basic features? What's the point of offering anything at all then? Just make it a paid app. Disgraceful and disappointing. Uninstalled. Not gonna install again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. I was just introduced to this app by my neice. I LOVE IT!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and definitely helps keep track of what you owe people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have really liked using this app for any shared expenses! it has helped ease the cost splitting! it is user-friendly, allows you to split based on equal amounts, percentages, etc! love love love"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get trying to get money from a product that costs time and money to develop. But the daily limit and the price for premium is not really realistic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Per day only 3 entry allowed if you need more then need to buy pro version. Really bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"incredibly difficult to use now with the maximum daily limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too expensive to purchase. Too cheapskate for free version. We didn't go trip 360 days/year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"go"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not at all f2p."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a good app for tracking bills with my SO, until they started forcing a monthly fee. I would've paid for a 1 time fee. But this app is not worth $40/yr. Esp when I would only use the 1/10th of the ""pro"" features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"so far so good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not very user friendly for a free user there are better apps that allow the same function for free now with unlimited entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"💩"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Classic example of developer getting greedy and ruined it for everyone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app and really useful, even if you use the free version. It's a bit annoying the limit of bills that you can insert, but it's the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Praises for the founders for simplyfying but detailed application. Great Job. Keep it up. Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very easy way to organise payments for a group holiday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"may be come up with some other ways of making money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The non-pro version has now started forcibly preventing you from adding more than 5 expenses a day. I'm happy to wait through a timer or ad. But please let me use the app for it's intended purpose. If the pro version wasn't a subscription I would have bought it ages ago."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's one of the best apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use tricount instead. Asking to wait 10 seconds to add an expense two times in a row then limiting to 3 transactions a day is criminal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍 application for split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version now not worth it at all. If you need the plus plan it's great, but the free plan is no longer worth the download."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect for groups trips and activities."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its frustrating cannot even purchase the pro version, shows to check country in Play store"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pressure to become profitable has pushed a lot of users away. They could have started with the pricing model at a lower price. But they wanted to make money and apparatenly a majority of people didn't find there application worth the amount they were thinking."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't know how whole company leadership managed to convince that money tracking app is worth $34 a year. And for a functionality so simple essentially forcing itself out of the market by introducing pay walls. The only thing I am not happy about is now all of our friends need to switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for splitting payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great. now only 5 spending per day can be added, or a monthly fee has to be paid. But there is no point this app is only useful a few times a year to plan vacation. Will find a replacement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful free app. Impartial and efficient!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The most simple yet very useful app to track daily expenses. By using this app, splitting the expenses among friends has become convenient and easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise makes group trips very easy. Just enter everything, you can customize how expenses break up if it's not even, then turn on the feature to simplify debts so everyone can just make one lump payment at the end!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limiting the usage of the most basic core functionality (nr of expenses) renders the free version useless, this is essentially a trial of the paid app. Usable if you add no more than 3 entries per day and don’t want to bulk add any after a trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My wife and I have used Splitwise for over 10 years, but today is our last day using it. It now only allows three expenses to be added a day unless you pay $5 a month. Even for the three expenses, it makes you wait 10 seconds after each expense while begging you to pay $5 for a glorified Excel spreadsheet. If they offered it for $10 a year we'd pay, but $5 a month is a joke for something I could have ChatGPT develop in a few hours."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've used Splitwise on two occasions when traveling with friends. It is very simple to use and accurate. It's made traveling with people that much easier, as you can keep a running total of what is owed by the minute. I highly recommend this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App of trash.. why do I need to wait to write something until tomorrow just because the developers want more money?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just plain simple to keep things settled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They want money now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 transactions. Takes the social security number"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best thing since sliced bread."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has become frustrating, ads i understand but keeping basic features behind paywall isn't done. Do all you want, not gonna pay you a single penny 😁😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool for tracking expenses with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and userfriendly app. I always use it when traveling with people. The only negative point is the apps just allows you to input 3-4 expenses per day when running the free version of the app (plus waiting 10 seconds advertisement between entry and entry....)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious restrictions making it unusable for the free tier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really aggressive measures to coerce you into a premium subscription for what is essentially an Excel sheet? No thanks. There are plenty of actually free apps out there like tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I save months of financial data and suddenly they render the app unusable with their limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great with many reasonable free features. Now just another cash grab app. Can barely do anything with it without either paying for a subscription or watching an ad for everything you do. Sad to see it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for friends group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not easy to navigate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great idea. But there's a limit on the expenses you can add in a day for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best way to keep track of shared expenses. Really, this is amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need more customisation for transaction wise settlement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment is required even for the basic operations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is limited unless you pay.... cant even add several more expenses without being met with a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money hungry and pathetic. Used to be extremely useful but now the app has gone down the drain"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a great app. But the new limit of four expenses a day is just annoying and impractical. The monthly subscription costs are also quite high. I will be switching to other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app for easy settlement of expenses. Makes life very easy during group travels."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App was excellent before - but now unusable unless you pay for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to track costs for a group of friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, makes sharing bills so easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I won't recommend a specific alternative, but I highly advice anyone to seek out an alternative to this app (or Reddit or wherever). Ever since the 2024 update, it's a complete cash grab. It's an incredibly simple app, I could model all functionality in a simple excel sheet, so any subscription-based revenue model is going to be overpriced. The cost of subscription is inconsistent and shady at best as well. On top of that they now made the free model (which is ad supported) borderline useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Used it for a summer vacation with 5 friends. It took the stress out of keeping track of expenses. We all loved it! Soooo easy and the perfect app. Will be using from now on. Genius!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Excellent for maintaining IOUs. Very easy to use plus loads of additional features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"decent app but ads and price model are disgusting, there's probably better alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tooooo many ads! Ridiculous! Doesn't let you add any expense until waiting for splitwise pro ad to pass through. Closing my account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time limit is horrible thing while usig the app☹️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"They put a limit to the number of expenses to split. Otherwise it's a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app used to be great, until the premium/pro version has become almost necessary to do anything in the app. Just food for thought, Splitwise Strategy team or whoever is responsible for this change, I don't think it makes sense to introduce pro/premium version for people who wants to / needs to / has to split the money. So this audience is only gonna find an alternative which does the same stuff for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice App... its very usefull who is living and expenses sharing with friends or others"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gotta be kidding... Even the basic functionality is limited in the free version. Looking for replacements. Go Splid!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Inconveniencing users to force them into buying a premium version/subscription is disgusting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An effective Efficiency tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Prático e funcional. Recomendo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Was our goto app for years but the recent limitations forced us to move to a new app. They even increased their monthly subscription by 4X. I hope the team will reconsider and come up with something balancing. But grateful to them for providing us this platform, it was immensely helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they made it a junk/spam app. one day we can add only 4 expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 4 expenses per day ruins the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"IRRISORIAMENTE CARO: que cada integrante del grupo deba pagar una suscripción de 20000 COP (5-7 USD) es ilogicamente caro. Es más caro que la suscripción de Netflix, YouTube, Spotify o cualquier otra plataforma de streaming. Ya van llegando alternativas gratis así que les recomiendo que las busquen antes de crear el próximo grupo de gastos aquí. Lo disfruté mucho hasta que la avaricia les ganó. TIP: se pueden saltar la restricción de transacciones diarias desde la la versión web"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is pointless at this point"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally good app for team events and group vacations. Thank you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"useful app to split the bill on holidays or meals note that you have to pay outside of the app. Edit: 2024 review. Too much is behind the paywall now, it sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally took forever to get my friends and family to setup an account and teach them how the app works, now I have to look for an alternative since all the main features are paid now. Thanks splitwise, way to ruin a good thing!!!!! Update to developer's response: what went wrong is that you started charging the users for the most basic features of your app!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super useful whenever you keep moving money between a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As a family we have been using Splitwise for family holiday and other shred events for years. It's so easy and marked the end of all of those, did we, didn't we, family discussions about shared costs A+++++"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version only allows 3 entries per day. So it's now basically useless. I recommend splid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for group trips! Will not do a group trip again without it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"5 Star to 1 Star. Can only add 4 expenses a day across multiple groups and for that, you have to wait as well. It used to be super good but not anymore with these changes. The why: There are so many free apps out there offering the same services, why would anyone pay?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed and annoyed to find that Splitwise only lets me add 4 expenses a day. My friends and I have been using it over years to split our expenses on trips, but naturally we're not on trips every single month to justify the subscription cost of going Pro. There are no other options like watching ads. Shame on this money grab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent and very helpfull app for students and other bachlors who spend money a lot Helping us to split and know our expenses very well 😀"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ease of use and love the value it adds."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"always helpful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three entries per day is a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now they are going to charge a fee to allow you to input unlimited expenses. the cost is definitely not worth it for using this app for maybe 2 trips a year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They HEAVILY monetized the app and made it nigh unusable. I understand the need to earn money, but at THIS much detriment to UX, especially when peope use your app once in a while for trips with friends and there are many alternatives out there? Talk about shooting yourself in the foot..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app in it's category."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app... Helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"third class"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years. Very inconvenient for it to want a Pro Membership for adding more than 3 expenses in one day. I'll be looking for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Settlement should be acknowledged by both the parties."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There are better options to split your expenses since Splitwise now only has 3-4 free entries per day. The constant pop ups and adverts to buy premium is too irritating at this point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 sec timer too long to add an expense, looking for alternative app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to split any kind of expenses ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses and making you wait 10 seconds to add an expense is wild. This used to be my favorite app to use and I used to rec it to everyone I knew. Now it's my most hated app and will be deleting it off my phone. Money grubbers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best way to keep track of group spending with your friends and family. Keep things fair and square for those friends that always have a tab ;)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No good just wants you to go pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I think the idea of Splitwise is brilliant. If you are in the habit of holidaying in groups or enjoying activities with friends, Splitwise is an easy and efficient way of keeping a record of your spending and sharing the costs. It's also very easy to use. I thoroughly recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limits make the app unusable. Instead of the daily limits maybe adding monthly limits would have been much better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a highly useful app, but it has sadly lost its credibility now. What was once a seamless experience has become frustrating. The app now lacks even the most basic features and feels like a waste of time. Despite not having ads to show, it disrupts the flow with unnecessary ""ad breaks"" for each expense entry. To make things worse, there's now a limit of only 4 entries per day. Also no search options. Overall, it's a very disappointing and frustrating experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"pretty useful. me and some housemates at uni just used it to keep a running total of costs we'd owe each other for toiletries, shopping and the like. then when it comes time to settle up, it's already calculated for us."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent aap for splliting the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can't buy premium for adding entries now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very convenient for large groups of people making big purchases. whether it's a shared tab, vacation rental, rental car, groceries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app for several years, but the recent changes make it unusable. When inputting multiple expenses, you get an add, each time. Now, I also stumbled on a daily limit, I'm outraged. I understand the need for users to pay, but this will lead to less users for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to settle all expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update, the app started displaying ads, making it difficult to add and track expenses. Users can only add 2 expenses per day, otherwise, more ads are shown."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses per day in free version is a bit low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"You can add just 3 expenses a day or else ""Subscribe"" so you can add more expense on a group trip. Have been using this app for quite a long time now, but this new paywall is really frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic experience nowadays"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has become much worse now that functionality is limited without a subscription. Will be looking for an alternative and would not recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not soo good now.... desperation of pro selling is at its peak."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For those of us without access to digital wallet apps for tab splitting, this is a perfect alternative. Update: App is gradually being stripped of free features over the last year or so. It is now reaching the point where it is unusable without a subscription. If the monthly cost wasn't priced so high, it wouldn't be so bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Buy pro subscription for 5 stars review"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to track shared expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introducing daily limits is a nightmare. Stopped using the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free only 3 transaction. If you want to use more, you need to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 entry daily... ? There is a gradual degradation of services compare to earlier. Make pro version with more value addition rather than enclosing normal feature into pro. Now it is the time to say goodbye and find alternative for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Thanks for syncing standard Excel calculation between several people. The most logical would be to connect / sync PayPal or Google pay, so that you don't have to search for person and retype the amount of debt in PayPal. This function is missing and makes the Idea of the application not fully thought out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Either you die as a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer free, and $5/mo is unreasonably pricey for the service offered, especially considering every member of the group must have their own subscription. It still works like it always has, but only with the required subscription. Because Splitwise has been good and free (with ads) for so long, there hasn't been many competitors. That's changing, and I strongly suggest considering an alternative before starting your next Splitwise group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always asking join pro and asking amount unable to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to Delete"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is locked behind a pay wall now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I am using free version. It's amazing 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy app for splitting payments, especially with a group of people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ghatiya app, with wahiyat interface and wahiyat working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every action you do is interrupted unless you get a Pro. Really bad experience.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"love ..it but hate the limitations of 7 entries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So many ads it's not usable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How greedy can you be? Having a limit for adding expenses?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever,worst ui experience and intentionally they are confusing us to pay for premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app to use with friends, but now, with a maximum of five expenses a day, it makes it almost unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App broken, Can't click any buttons to login or signup."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A handy tool for keeping track of everyone's spending when out in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"convenient app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit is disappointing. People would be better to use Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, now they want you to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I cannot take the paid version. There are many companies that are providing this service for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app but they just keep finding ways to make it worse by putting more and more features behind a paywall. Even with full access there isn't enough features to warrant paying more than a few dollars one time. The creator should try implementing unintrusive ads or a one time fee if they want to make money off it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Better free alternatives exist"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is officially useless unless you use the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pushing u to go premium only after 5 expenses. Super annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used to be so great but now it's awkward to use and the ""wait"" worked in to make you pay for it is 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. Great for friend group traveling or roommate expense sharing.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great. Now it limits expenses to 5 daily plus annoying ads on basic plan. Has all good features but insisted on sending invited to people. Terrible experience now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cunning and Greedy. They put essential features behind paywall after acquiring monopoly. This will soon be replaced by the open-source (eg Spliit) community. RIP Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unless you pay for it, it isnt very useful. Because of plaid requirements, can't use PayPal to fund the pay side of things."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst limitations ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, handy and intuitive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Clever how it works, reasonably simple to operate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stay away. I added 5 expenses. I hit a limit on free version. I deleted them, added 1 more, I still hit a limit and it says wait until tomorrow or forces you to buy it. I rarely use it. Pathetic. I'll stick with excel or Google sheets. SO MANY FREE and good apps out there. Not wasting money on this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great app, very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gendu App hain yeh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so useful with roommates! highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become useless since you can only ad 3 expenses per day or need to buy premium. Nonsense paywalls! Bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would I buy Pro for splitwise. Bro don't understand its market segment well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy peasy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this is an awesome way to show expenses in a share house or on a holiday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst update only 3 entries per day very poor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made my life easier. We are a group of 12. This app made all our transactions and balance calculation easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad app asks for subscription and doesn't let use free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The premium model for this makes no sense makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app for money management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very easy to use, makes groups trips/activities easier to plan and pay for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can now only put 3 expenses per day and have to wait each time. Otherwise broken on my phone but seems to magically work on my husband's just fine. No thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits on an app like this just doesn't make sense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much of ads, pathetic experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great for keeping track of your money owed, but bad for ""friendships"""
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A fabulous app for management in tes of money it splits it perfectly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why so desperate for pro eh??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"GreT for tracking expenses and making everyone pays their fair share."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use Tricount instead, it's free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"recent update which is forcing the use of the premium version is not good to add some different features in premium but don't restrict the normal usage functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App does its job and works well, no complaints until the daily limit on expenses was introduced to push you into paying a subscription, artificially making the app very inconvenient if you have any more than several expenses to add in one day. I would prefer the app to be loaded with ads rather than demanding a monthly payment in order to perform a simple convenience task."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money minded"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses a day is a joke!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is a good option to record transactions, it gives us an option to record monetary stuff into one place."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and effective app to manage expenses especially in a large group! Easy to use also"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes trip spending in group easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be the best. Now there are ads and daily limits to added transactions. On top it will link incorrect Venmo accounts and send money to the wrong person! Do not use this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"what an app! has grown big over the years and feature rich too. brilliant! 👍🏾"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expense limit of adding just 4 with the free version is pathetic, this has complely destroyed the purpose of the app and drastically affects usability. The Pro version to remove this limit is too costly making the app unaffordable. It used to be a great app for managing expenses among groups easily but the monetization has killed its purpose, they could have kept a reasonable pricing forthe Pro plan but instead made it super expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Una app demasiado cara para lo poco que hace. Y la versión gratis es inutilizable si de verdad quieres llevar todas las cuentas. Además requiere conexión a internet constante para agregar gastos, entre muchas otras cosas a medio hacer (gastos personales por ejemplo)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is a bug spiltwise app is able to access my media file without giving permission to app Please fix it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The rate limiting is a major drawback. Instead of pushing users to upgrade to pro memberships in this manner, they should have offered exclusive features that pro users would find appealing and possibly introduced ads in the UI for free users. I used this app extensively during my college days and loved it, but now it's a different story."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Pretty good way to handle group expenses. Our family uses it for vacations. Not perfect, but good enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"High prices"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It would be significantly easier to do by hand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"3 Expenses? Really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can i receive amount from Amazon or any other online selling platform? Can i use it fir selling and buying? Can i use it in Pakistan?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app used to be, but useless with recent update with restricted number of transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Giving 1 star for making all features paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can live with the artificial delay but the daily limit for number of expenses you can add is just stupid. Don't even offer a free version if you're going to kneecap it so hard"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"radical for housemates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"use it for splitting costs for kids after divorce. Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Edit: The app has changed a lot since my last review. Now free version doesn't allow much of transactions. You can't plan a single trip with free version. One of the must have for all those who do group expense and settle the dues later as and when required. The best feature is the simplify debt. It do the total round of and tells who own how much irrespective of individual small small settlements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not serve the purpose anymore to split the trip expenses as 3 entries per day is nothing as need at least 30-40 entries. Once purchase is ok subscription is not worth it for occasional use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's now a money monger."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to split the pay!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app for sharing expenses with others"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't install it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for wise and quick distribution of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting that they set a number of expense limit. Literally, unusable right now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest updates for allowing to add 3 entries in a day is bad and would instigate to move to other free apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app, but the newest update caps expenses to 10 a month?! Without pro, what a joke and blantent money grab. I haven't entered anything in days and I'm blocked first thing. Each review has a different time frame. I'd watch an ad to enter expenses at this point. It's the last month I'll be using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Wundervolle app, nur schwer benutzbar ohne Premium. Mit 4€ im Monat füre eine so einfach App wirklich frech. Eine 10€ einmalzazwäre es mir soagre wert. Ich wechsele auf jedenfal.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise used to be amazing! Used it for years, great for trips with friends, easy to keep track of the bill But now they just spam you with ads to try to make you pay $5/mo for pro. You can't even add more than a handful of expenses now I refuse to pay for basic functionality, look elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You did not have to be predatory in order to rack up the profits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Application is now upgraded & works fine but why you have make it paid means after few entries asking for money which we don't like."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app! It has so simplified traveling with friends!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app, easy, nice. Well done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App very limited if not pro, waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad limitations for free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Whatever i need is easy to use, till you have to pay....to prove you have money...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"m-m-m-money money 💰"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Next solution for friends trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have made almost everything paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After few entries it started asking for money. Why should people pay for that if the same features are available in other apps also? Eventually this app will loose customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be awesome for my trips! Couldnt live without it. But now that they limit so much functions that pretty much means you have to pay to use it. I cant even enter more than 4/5 expenses per day and have to pay to add in more. I will switch to some other apps or even use an excel sheet instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nothing that I don't like about this app! Been a constant since forever, whether it's a trip, expenses within flatmates, office party, etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started to become greed and that's their downfall...used to be best..i would have always recommended this if not for the latest update which asks for pro for adding expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hated it! Why they limited number of adding expenses for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"game changer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the daily entries, make the free app useless. Another alternative is splitkaro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using Splitwise for over 8 years. But ever since the new update it has become unusable for free users. I understand the need to make a buck but the current model just puts free users off. Plus the app doesn't even have a lifetime subscription option. As someone who does not like to pay for subscriptiona, it's a no go. Changing to some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 2 expensive can add after that you have to buy membership."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The devs have their heads on backwards and don't know how to keep users happy. It now looks like they've started paying bot accounts for generic 5-star reviews after making wildly unpopular changes that resulted in everyone giving them 1-star reviews. Use Splid if you need an app without nonsensical limits and ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to 3 expenses per day (core feature) is ridiculous. I'll be switching apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"group creation add expenses daily limit... Not allows to add expenses... Also 10 sec waiting for ads each time... Poor user experience..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Definitely recommend. Does it's job pretty well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good app, wish they didn't have most of the convenience features paywalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be better, you need to pay to have it in a useable state while the extra features would otherwise not be worth paying for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too complicated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app with terrible minimisation. Will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you think I'm willing to pay a monthly subscription, you are out of your mind. Uninstall. Would prefer an ad before adding each expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not recommended. You need to create an account, you need to give the mail address of people in the group, there is a limit how many expenses per day you can add without a pro account. That is stupid. Use Spliit as an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be good for tracking expenses in the past. But now with the latest update where we can make only 5 bills per day, it's no longer worth the hassle. Worst part is that it's not 5 bills it counts, but 5 changes. If you comment on a transaction, edit and already existing bill, each of these is counted as 1 activity. It's now taking weeks to add one 4 day trips bills! Time to switch to a new app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app, but you have to sort out the search cost item search function for Pixel 6. Nearly unusable, very buggy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a very helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic, so irritating. Forcing to buy pro at every click. Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For groups that travel and share expenses, this app is awesome. I also love the fact that it has a phone app and web interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app developers have become greedy, asking for money for even entering 5th expense of the day, pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Best app ever. It was very difficult to manage traveling expanses before this app butnow its tooooooo easy. Update: now adays they become too greedy and allow only 3 entries per day and after each you have to watch an add for pro version, 3€/month no thanks I'd rather look for an alternative, good bye and enjoy ruining your app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely ruined by the developers' greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ghatia app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise needs to understand it is defying it's primary application of group splits.. people like to do the accounting after their trips, if you limit to only 5 activities (not even expense update but deletion and too) then nobody wants to open their accounts and do the accounting for 4-5 days. People want to do it in one sitting, which also increases the effectivity as you get into the flow and remember everything. I am already searching for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great experience using this tool. A much needed and Useful application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max tx per day. Poor decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes things so much easier on road trips!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the addition of splitwise pro is useless...no one will pay for that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice to keep organized the bills and trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use p"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, now I have to pay for the alcohol also and to split the alcohol also :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is very slow"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed has taken over the company"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best pak for split expenses within friends and family 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not entering my SS# for this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible, we have been using this app for years (5 years), even used the paid version for 2 of those. Now, you are limited to 5 transactions per day. Useless, such a terrible oversight."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wonderful way to track and share expenses on trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful 👍🏻🌟🔥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Apparently now you have to pay for pro account to add more expenses. Other apps are much more useful and do it for free. Was nice to use before, but now they push to upgrade for pro much more annoyingly by reducing basic free usability. Now I have to transfer my group travel exoenses to Splitser."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update to capping the daily input limit makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its a paid version with no good features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking pro for every options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"used to love this app, now it's worst, everytime asking for pro version, otherwise it won't allow to put more than 4 expenses. Now splitting the bill also is chargeable 😂, evidently good things doesn't last much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app, but kind of messed up that they switched it from a free app to limiting the number of transactions you can post at a time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"easy to use and understand once you know how it works, makes group expenses a breeze"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love love love this app, so convenient to teach the expenses and it has Excel sheet , please take my money!!!!!!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I lost $112 due to an app malfunction November 2019, and now that I'm getting rid of the app and settling all debts, the app shows different balances on the phones of the different members of one group. Paper and a pen would be better than this app. Update: used this app again for some group trip expenses, and it is super cryptic and it sloshes debt around when trying to settle up making for a confusing and unsatisfying experience for everyone. A simple spreadsheed would be much better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes sharing expenses across the group incredibly easy and transparent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Limits and ads for expenses are annoying now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The UX is confusing; it's hard to tell what will happen when using the ""Simplify"" functionality (I would expect to see a behavior log on each group member's balance, showing what ""Simplify"" has done to reach this outcome). Another issue is that there are no real-time updates; some views need to be refreshed manually to see the actual state. Could not update the splitting after new members entered the group; had to delete and recreate expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started with the timeouts... enshittification galore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the 4 expenses daily limit. Changing to another one after years of usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Simple results, nuanced interpretation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Now, you can only add up to 4 expenses per day for free, of which 3 of those require a 10 second timer each time before you can add the expense. The price for pro is the same price for Netflix. I cannot recommend it any longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helpful to maintain a record of multiple transactions with various contributors."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a simple app that you occasionally use. Now greed got to it. You can't add more than 3 expenses a day without paying 30 eur subscription! It's still a simple app - excel sheet with custom UI. There are alternatives, use them instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No es muy inteligente la manera que tiene de arreglar los pagos"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent for group outings!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not intuitive. Not user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful and efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads for everything. It was good before. Now it is very bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish now without paying. Disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for tracking and sharing expenses. Makes life so easy.. no more hassle of maintaining expenses when out on a vacation with a big group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very happy and convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but with the unreasonably low number of daily expense entries its become effectively useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Worth the money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Lovely app , very convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was nice, but later become irritating always prompting for purchasing Pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app must be free. Otherwise there will be plenty alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely kneecapped your app with these stupid AD's and limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is great for short term transactions, like trips with the girlfriends. For anything longer term it is confusing and hard to find the informative I need. Overall, great for trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the introduction of the pay tier it lost everything. Big L"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great until they lowered the functionality of paying via venmo in favor of their own service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are forced to share contact details for everyone you add to a trip. Instant uninatall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ad are irritating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to put in expenses now. To be remotly usable, you need a pro account at the price of a streaming service, absolutely insane!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, but now you can only add 4 expenses per day unless you subscribe. I'm about to start a trip and thank god I opened the app I saw the mess they've made. You also have to watch an add before adding each expense. It's a joke of an app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great way to keep track of team costs, as we run a race team of 4 and Bills get split perfectly and equally! avoids any arguments or disagreements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is locked behind payments now. Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Barely usable now, you have to wait to add expenses and have a limit of three a day. They might as well just convert it into a paid app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bring back the free features!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app to record expenses and settle debts with friends on a trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty 😍 handy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now it really sucks so I have uninstalled it. The purpose of using this app is to split expenses btw 2 or more people, so the update to restrict the number of entries one can input is really a big fail! Anyone who goes on a trip will surely incur multiple expenses every day, so how can anyone use this app if it restricts a user to only a few expenses per day?! I immediately uninstalled the app upon facing this issue. Would rather use an Excel or Google Sheet 🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes in the subscription model are really prohibitive for free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"During editing of an old expenses, I'm not able add one more person who is in the same group. I have to delete that than I need to create one more for that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect app to keep track of expenses in a large group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It should be free to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything turned into paid features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"amazing app to spit bills very usefull if u are bachelor and stay with ur friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app, perfect for sorting out any shared expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update changing basic options to payed made this app really annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Even more free features now locked behind subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was great now they limit adding on 3 expenses per day. Like stop. I'm finding another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive, free version now too limited to be of any use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app, it makes group trips a breeze. I do wish there was a feature to pay off individual items and/or deduct miscellaneous payments made off the app vs one big payment. Maybe in a future update? Please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The free version is barely usable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful when I go on trips with friends. No one cares who is picking up the tab, as we know it will be sorted out at the end. Highly recommended!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app for a group travelling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ADs before adding an expense? Seriously"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great but remember to not use it more than 3 times each."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome for a group of people travelling together!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed is taking over"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Incredibly limiting. Only 4 entries allowed daily with 10 second ads on the 3rd entry (on my android). However, my friend with an iPhone is allowed 6 entries daily. Why is there such discrepancy?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best way to split expenses among mates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome way to split expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you can only add 4 expenses per day. will be looking for a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Greed ruined them. FO. Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now you are limited to 3 transactions each"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free, after 10 expenses, it requires subscription. Use free toold instead. It's just money a grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be very good before restricting so many features for free-users. If at least there were a option for a one-time fee, I would certainly buy it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent way to manager your expenses in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good, now it's junk if you don't pay for the subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is now a limit of transactions per day which makes this app non functional"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for traveling with friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for group trips or just eating out with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money again n again is so frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thanks to Kopal bhai for suggesting me this app. helps a lot"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for bachelor life"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Took the misery out of splitting costs and figuring out who owes what in a 7-women bachelorette party. Absolutely critical"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made it very limited access is soo annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, simple to use but has just enough features to use without purchasing the paid version. very happy so far"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was fine earlier but now you people have become so blinded by greed that you have started asking for money after adding just three or four expenses, which is wrong. One or the other competitor of yours will come soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Daily limit of expenses for free version is unreal. Makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Truly amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is an outstanding app for managing group expenses. The user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use. Its functionality is top-notch, offering robust features to track and settle shared expenses seamlessly. The app performs reliably, with minimal bugs, and integrates well with payment services like Venmo and PayPal. Additionally, customer support is responsive and helpful. Highly recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app but keeps asking for pro subscription-based"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome service for settling bills between friends and colleagues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use and very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple to use! Helps keeps money spending and paying back fair."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont bother installing this app , the glory of what it used to be is now in history books , it asks you to go premium after 3-5 cost expenses / day for sharing across members takes the sheen away. There are more apps that are simpler, user friendly and more effective in the play store now. I suggest you opt them ....."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Number of expenses you can add per day is limited. Makes the app useless if you don't have the subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Expenses limited if u have the free option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The term ""enshittification"" is used to describe when product features are diminished in the pursuit of profit. Splitwise used to be *the* go-to app for splitting expenses. Now it is full of nag screens and a hard limit of three (3!) transactions in a day. I would purchase a pro version of this app for a one-time fee, but a £40 a year subscription isn't good value. Developers need to eat too, but greed has killed this app. RIP. 🪦 Account deleted, app uninstalled. 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome to travel with friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive and only allows upto 5 transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Edit: my opinion has changed. I still use this app, mainly because I am tied to it now, but the way they are forcing people to pay is pathetic. I understand they need to make money, but it should be a one time buy, not subscription. This app is just amazing. You spend whenever you go out or buy something, put its record in this and voilà! Leave rest to it. It has all the option, who paid, multiple people paid, unequal sharing, everything. Only app you need if you're living in sharing. Wow!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Severly limited free use. If you want to show ads, show ads. But don't force me to update to a subscription when I really don't want to."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wants you to pay after adding 5 expenses, ridiculous. Just do more ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"app sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhout complicated hai app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"has to pay to do the most basic function - adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Bad monetization scheme"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Practically impossible to use without a subscription, and who would pay for an app like this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Tracking of expense is made easy. The simplification of group debt feature helps a lot in allocating expenses incurred by the group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not friendly. Does not allow to delete members if unsettled. Group members not seen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Free version works great. I would be happy to pay a one off payment for the app for them to stop trying to sell me a subscription. but a subscription is a bit too much for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Because of the pro version limiting the nr of daily expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for collective trips. Will work well in two currencies and has a good audit trail to sort out problems."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is worthless now. 10 second wait between adding expenses. Oh yes, only 4 expenses per day limit. Unfortunate business choice leading to many one-star reviews. Congratulations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works well for a free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It works!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"suddenly my all expensives are settled up i dont know why"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now you are heavily limited in the things you can do with the free version as all the latest reviews also show. It's such a shame that in trying to monetise this success, they treat early adopters like that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have always enjoyed using this app but it irritates me increasingly every day. Now they want you to have a subscription so that I can put in more than 4 entries per day. I'm NOT prepared to pay the ridiculous subscription price for an app I might use 2x a year. I give this app a huge thumbs down. Reading other reviews makes it clear that the developers are NOT interested in us, they only want to fleece the consumer.😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app syncs expenses after 1 week on weak internet network. Please fix this asap. Also the ads are pretty annoying and the limit of adding expenses in a day in the free model just defeats the purpose of the app. Might have to switch to some better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"kis baat k paise maang rhe ho be"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible pricing for monthly or yearly subscriptions. Will totally go back to start tracking group expenses on Excel. May think about an one time Full version purchase for $9.99 but no more than that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very easy to use and track expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy for any kind of travel - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to go for pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting your basic function behind a pay wall is absurd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Top may add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would've happily pay if it was a 1 time fee. Right now I forcefully deny paying a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful and convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient. Works very well for groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App for group vacations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for keeping track and accurately splitting expenses with ease"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"What if i settle up and not pay the person?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This isn't what it used to be. The app was amazing, but the pricing seems ridiculous for a service thats no different than an excel sheet. I used this from 2013 but not anymore. Rest in peace splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Can't add more than the expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's completely useless because of the sub wall..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro membership is a scam"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"extremely useful. makes group trips simpler"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please add Russian language."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, use for all trips. easy of use and recording payment done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sax sux Yes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app forces you to purchase a subscription if you want to file more than 3 transactions a day with your friends. This app also forces you to watch ads for 10s before filing any transactions. Horrible app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good. tried gpay splitting option earlier and this is much more smarter sw than gpay split."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full of Ads Desperately asking to buy Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hadn't used it in a while. Got a friend into it to use for a recent trip, then found the free tier completely hobbled. No point using this glorified calculator anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently you are not able to use the app for more than four expenses. You have to upgrade for money. Not to be recommended anymore🤨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an extremely useful app. Now it's a mad money grab to push everyone to Splitwise Pro. They limit the number of transactions you can put and for each transaction, you have to watch an ad before being able to put it in. Awesome idea, but they messed it up with their greed. Hopefully sometime develops a similar app soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's good and simplified."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"In the pursuit of pushing pro version the app has become most irritating thing. Licensing pro version should be one time instead of making monthly payment or yearly payment then users will opt for it. Most would be not interested in paying recurring charges. If not splitwise someother app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"These guys have royally screwed up in their efforts to fill pockets. Have made the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"V good App save my lot off Time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is the best! So easy to use and makes settling up with friends a breeze, especially on big group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very frustrating with the paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I never thought this app will be so easy when someone mentioned me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but now the free version has been made completely useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Who thought a subscription is something this app needed. Good riddance!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very helpful financial app, people used to get great benefit, but now it's restrictions to get a pro paid version seems to be a fall from great,,,As we can not pay, We shall go back to excel or pen paper..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Gud"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcefully asking to upgrade to pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good but unfortunately it's unusable now with all the paywalls. It just does not make sense for me to buy a subscription for something I use sporadically when I go on vacation. Disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Many features are needed 1. Make one admin in each group who can view totals by each user 2. Feature to add ad-hoc advance payments done by friends for future expenses 3. Exported CSV needs to be more like a accounting ledger and need to have separate column for who the payer is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best for splitting money among friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent and easy way to split expenses. Easy to use even for the less technically inclined."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app pretty much sucks now. They limit number of expenses you can add, and it's unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to recommend this app to every one but now it's turned into another shameless cash grab. In order to use it at all you've to sit through a countdown. Not even an advert just an unnecessary time gate. They've also limited the number of transactions you can add in a day which makes the app almost unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Integrate all the payment options like Phonepe, Paytm, Bharatpe, Net banking, NEFT etc to ease the settlement process. It's extra effort to make a payment online and then record it as cash payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise has been an absolute game changer! It really helped my partner and I to better manage and track our expenses. We would be lost without it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very suspect. App asks for social security number in order to use. Immediately uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting a limit on the number of expenses to push people to subscribe to the pro will have a backlash on the service. I've used Splitwise since 2015 but I think it's time to switch to something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now let's you add only 4 expenses in a day on the free version. That's absurdly low. Now won't buy pro even if I wanted to."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is complicated and doesn't provide excel and pdf reports and also catagoory wise report. Needs simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 txns per day is too less"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Scam app. Introduced paywall and limited expense adding without due information/notice. Not fair to those who have been using the app for ages"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really useful, works charmingly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice app to settle up expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be absolutely fantastic. This new pricing scheme does not suit what this app provides. The limited expenses per day for the free version and the waiting period is not user friendly. I understand bills have to be paid but I will NEVER pay $5 a month for an app I use twice a year. That pricing scheme makes absolutely no sense. I would be happy to pay a one time fee of $4.99. That is more equivalent to the use I would get out of the app. I will give 5 stars if this is changed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced a pro version with no heads-up on people after using the app for years. At least ask for contributions and allow people to opt in. Bogus"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be good but there no point in using it when you can't add more than three expenses per day. It's a classic money grab, which is unfortunate given they already show ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The entire experience is now unusable. Very poor free model. The usecase is not enough to warrant the price"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Probably one of the best application! We friends use it on our Pakistan northern tour. Very useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pointless addition of limiting the number of transactions that can be entered, along with adding ads ruins the ease of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used it for years and now they've decided to start charging to input your expenses. As if. Especially for a pretty rudimentary and clunky app. Go elsewhere. A great case study in alienating a wide and long built up customer base overnight."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and Helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The move to start charging for basic features of the app should lead to their downfall. Instead of making the app better to encourage users to pay for services, they decided to cap the basic features. Greedy losers. No thank you, plenty of other options on play store. Enjoy my 1 star rating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"need an option to make the payment using UPI like swiggy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Won't let more than a few expenses at a time be added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The functionality is wonderful, and I would've given it 5 stars back in the day. Now, they limit the number of entries per day for free users. So dumb. Every other app has figured out how to make money just with ads. Why are you different? Really hoping someone develops an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Practically useless unless you pay insane amount of money for the subscription. Sensless greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not able to add payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New restrictions are bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of 7 adds makes it unusable as a free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not simplifying the balances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app, but now devs are greedy and charging for basic features. Anyways SettleUp app is a good alternative for the above problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but the daily limit on expenses is so low, it's practically unusable. Horrible practice of slowly peeling away basic features to push the paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is too limited. Paid version is too expensive for what it brings. But it does the math correctly. Edit: after reading other reviews, I realize it's even worse than I thought: it's not just a one time purchase but a subscription!!!!! -4 stars for the predatory business model (that brings my rating to -1)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They keep putting limits on what used to be good. Max 4 entries per day now. And have to wait 10 seconds before each entry for ads. Too many barriers for even the most basic use. Too money hungry and greedy. Will look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Randomly sends msg to contacts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Scammer app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free purposed are made paid , doesn't make sense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid subscription is the worst thing you have done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a helpful app to make every transaction countable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor, Not a free application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything was good until they ad premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, now very limited and tedious with only 7 ""free"" expenses a day and 10 second ads between each expense. Trash!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app since 2018, but lately they had made it extremely difficult to use with all the waiting time,and now it seems there is no way but to buy their premium plan, goodbye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting a daily limit on how many expenses you can add is annoying as hell. You're better off just using Venmo's splitting features. Adding new features and putting them behind a paywall is fine, but restricting features to try and make a quick buck is cheap and disappointing. Do better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once a good app, ruined by a ridiculously high pay wall to actually be able to use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best one in place for now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bekar, time , internet waste"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"V useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best way to split expenses in a group travel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Edit: Just like everything, this is ad ridden"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"putting your expenses in Splitwise is so easy-to-use. Just record your payments to be split and the app does it all for you then lets the other person know what they owe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads while adding an expense is the most trashy UX I've seen in recent times. This app should be a open source project, not a real business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"A very fine and helpful app. It works really well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to split out the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its such a pity that such handy app restricts you from adding new entries after you have entered 3 entries on a single day. I would recommend people to find alternatives to this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app has the functionality to track a trip, I've loved using it for years now. But recently, they have gone downhill, including too many unnecessary features, 10 sec ad breaks, and limited the amount of expenses you can add per day to four. All the pain has been created to drive you to their subscription offering. If this app was a one-off payment, I would do it, but a monthly subscription is not worth it. Recommend finding another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best, amazing. Until a $5/month subscription to add more than 3 expense per trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall experience is good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good app, but forcing you to pay Pro way too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit on adding expenses for the free version is awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent tool for group trips,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was good. Limiting the number of expenses and ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazingly user friendly app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just to split expense need apro version. There are tons of free apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it! It makes everything so much easier when eating with friends or family. Easy to use, easy to settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Avoid! This app prevents more than 3 expense entries from being added per day. It never used to have this problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super easy to set up and use for group expenses and an easy way to settle up the totals as well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro version , I don't need"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good app. however paid service seems too costly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"purely scam"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I liked this app, not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have been fan of splitwise because of its simple and user friendly. But now its allows us to add only 3 expenses per day that too with ads. Subscription fare is too high for this app. Subscription can be mandatory for new features only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"basic feature requires subscription. That's a shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"₹49/month removed why 😭😭"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One star for limiting the per days expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use this for every holiday but now the free version is so unworkable as it limits the number of expenses you can add in a day. I don't want to spend multiple days slowly adding expenses after a holiday and it just isn't worth £3.99 a month for how often I use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You've reached the maximum number of added expenses today, get Splitwise pro... This app used to be useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application, super useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way of ensuring all expenses are correctly recorded. All the hard work is done for you by the app, no embarrassing moments as to who owes what as you agree the split on the total beforehand. Nice way to remind people they should settle up, when applicable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Guys you can now use Gpay for splitting expenses. It is free and veey easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"O App é excelente, só falta a opção de adicionar um anexo (pra add foto de nota fiscal) e uma opção de lançar um valor total com detalhamento (como se fosse uma NF), tipo, vou lançar o gasto do ""Jantar"" e dentro desse lançamento colocar os valores de cada item detalhado. Mas de resto, é bom demais, ajuda muito a organizar as despesas de uma viagem ou coisa do tipo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise completely turned its back on its user base with this greedy pricing scheme. The app used to be fantastic for splitting bills with friends, but now it feels like they're intentionally crippling the free version to force people into a subscription. Limited transactions, daily limits, and waiting periods? This is outrageous! Splitwise went from a brilliant app to a cheap money grab. Uninstalling and finding a new platform that treats its users with respect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Free tier is now really bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit make it unusable in the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ironic how I just recently recommended this to colleague only to find out it's updated free version will only allow 4 expenses a day. 🤦‍♀️ Woah. IMO, there's no point to even use an app to split expenses that consists of 4 items only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super cool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is this nonsense about limiting the amount of expenses you can add? One thing is limiting the total number of users in a group or other justifiable restrictions, but this is unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Needs pro version even for basic functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously? only 7 entry per day? And you are charging unreasonable amount. Jumping to new free simple split apps. varta mame durr... 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Even with the changes, it's a brilliantly simple app. The recent changes (7 daily inputs per person and adverts) have made it more difficult to use, however they do need to be sustainable. I will often pay for it when I'm on holiday as we use it more and it's really helpful. Original Makes paying for things between my partner and I so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They restrcited lots of features and made most features available only in pro version only. Also, the pro version is too expensive. The most liked app before a decade is not in my recommended apps list now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Has made tracking of expenses very easy. Specially with multiple currencies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful apps .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great and useful app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't know why they suddenly decided to ditch ads and make even the most basic functionalities premium!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience now that they have limited you to 3 expenses per day and 10 second ads before you can add any expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they want money to split expenses 😔.... Ppl will move another app ofcourse.. bye bye Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrost app wrong calculate this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I have to pay my roommate for even a coffee pouch?? WTFF!! You guys are the reason I am not close to my friends. I have to move back with my parents because of you, because they don't know anything about Splitwise, thank God! You guys are the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a very good app and i used it for past 4 years but now they have put even the basic feature under pay wall and that has ruined the whole app. Ad were fine if we want to add expense but you are adding ad as well as asking for subscription that is not fine"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nobody is paying Spotify prices for splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be SO good, it almost became an indispensable tool for me and my friends, as we would log things here during a trip, instead of making million of transactions with (say) venmo. But at the present state, the limitations for the non-pro version are basically crippling, as it limits the transactions per day, making it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Initially had given 5 few years back and with the paywall uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app I have ever seen to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be brilliant and I raved about how easy and simple it made managing expenses. Now in order to try and get you to pay for the pro version,they have severely restricted expenses you can add and force you to watch ads (for pro) for each expense you want to add. I am not going to pay for something I could do myself but this app just made easier, so will clearly be reverting to pen and paper instead. What a shame to have wrecked something that was a great aid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We all know why. Death to the subscription model for small apps like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so useful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I loved it initially but then they added the paywall. It's not useful to me anymore. I recommend that you find something else. Was good while it lasted, but like everyone else, they reel you in and then eventually charge you. Nothing new to see here."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was my go to app for splitting transactions, until they made adding transactions itself difficult. Watching an ad before adding an expense, waiting for 10 secs before adding an expense, 4 transactions per day limit & what not. The free version is basically unusable now & the paid version is way too expensive for the purpose it serves. Now the Pro version basically gives access to the features we once had for free. Greed is really evil. Will uninstall this app ASAP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy monetization destroyed this app. The price per month for pro is a joke, its sameish as for apps with content such is Spotify... No thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very limited nos of transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yes, developer need to be paid and nothing is free. I suggest a ads version of this amazing app instead of paid. At least give me something to stick to this app over switching to another app. I dont mind ads over top or bottom edge of app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible for limiting the entire main core function of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience... so easy and magic when you are travelling with friends... easy peesy, lemon squeezy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expensive monetisation for most basic features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good aap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app. Now, forcing users to pay for core feature (adding expenses) is big mistake. Me and my group of friends and colleagues will definitely move to something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary aggressive monitizing campaign. Uninstall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love the simplify tool. It's great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice app to maintain accounts while travelling or sharing expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Za＼(^-^)／c"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Absolutely useless app. They restrict number of expense input unless pay 999 inr per year. No one in India is going to pay this hefty money. They need to rethink their pricing model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Useful for calculations, easy to set up, and used by many. Would be even better if money transfers could be made via the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately, if you write more than about 10 expenses, you need a subscription. So is not really the right tool for occasionally expenses. Once there was also an error in the calculation. OLD REVIEW Great tool to make share expenses lists. You can create several groups and you can even add pictures and comments to the transactions. More people will share the same lists. Seamless sync across devices: When you get a new device, split wise gets synced automatically! GREAT"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nobody wants your 5 second unskipable add."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent app to record group exps either while travelling together or living together. Only issue is the limit of 4 exps entry per day... We have used it for 4 group trips already ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"greed got the better of them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely predatory monetization"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app for group travel. I highly recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It does not count properly in the header of group and result is differ from settle up button. Very big delay of recounting. Limited expenses and delay in 10 seconds. After trip when i recount by hands the result was differ that this app shows me. Can only be used as a list of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years, about once or twice per year. Turn it on today, and there's a paywall after adding a few expenses. It's pay A SUBSCRIPTION or wait a day. People usually add all the expenses AFTER the trip is done, so having to wait a day makes 0 sense for this type of app. Asking for a subscription for something most people will use once a year is criminal. This app used to be great, but now, look elsewhere :/"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"In my last trip the free version was unusable as we hit the entries limits very easily a f ew times. We switched to another app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good application 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is good 💯💯"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Maximum number of free expenses lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great program"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is useless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app, but now limited to 4 records a day which is really nothing. Should give the option to one time purchase, but only an expensive monthly/yearly subscription is possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, provides great transparency. now the arguments aren't about ""how much"" (is gone, was paid etc.) but ""how do we split the bill""."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Heavy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be the best but now it's the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Concept for this Application is quite good. and just started using this app with my colleagues at work. superb!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads....can only ad 4 expenses on free mode, need to BUY PREMIUM to add more EDIT : You have two options, either wait for 24 hours to add your 5th expense, or can INSTALL a different Split Expense app available from a bunch of options on PLAYSTORE, choice is yours."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to work well now it stole a lot of my time and then locked me out pf adding more expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best in class"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a Great app overall. Recently, the idea of waiting for 10 seconds to add or update a new expense after a certain number has really been annoying. To the makers: either keep those things for free or make it completely paid, no point hanging in the middle! Also, App never responds on 1st open, need to close the app several times before it can be actually used."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Practically useless as most of the app is behind a pay wall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly. A great big help sorting out group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore. $40 a year for something I use twice a year? Ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now they've hidden basic features behind a paywall. Such a shame!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are now limiting the amount of expenses you can do in a day to 3. Seems pretty ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"improve app interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"sharking for money is never a good look"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 transactions a day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been a fan of this app for years, me and my whole group of friends and I used to depend on this, but now this app has just become money oriented. Limit on number of transactions, watch an ad for each transaction, and more and more. Could the team explain how we can have only 4 transaction on everyday on a trip ? Anyways, as the old saying goes, greed kills the best, sad to see such a great platform dying. We will switch to other alternatives or traditional ways, you RIP!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more expenses now a days, for every click it will ask to upgrade to pro by paying the amount. Not user friendly, worst app. Stopped using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app since 2017/18. In fact I referred this app to many because this app was the masterpiece. Now due to its new update you can add only 3 entries per day which is nonsense. After this I tried many alternative apps but most of them didn't had web UI option. After so much research, Now I shifted to new app called ""Settle up"". Obviously the apps UI is not good as splitwise but serves the purpose. It has web interface also."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Should be free or less charges"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free tier is basically unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the go-to app for expenses tracking and now you can't use even the most basic feature of the app without paying. Limit of 3 expenses a day makes the app basically useless if you want to use the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very friends friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall - a great app for managing and splitting expenses among friends, room mates and families. We've been using this since it was just a web app and its earlier stage to now having it's app. Never cared to explore other apps Feedback/feature request: It would be good to add some check point in the expenses to mark when the people in the group can pay, so that will allow everyone to submit/add their expenses and then the total/group expenses can be tallied to derive who owns who finally."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really expensive pro tier. Also not a one off payment but a subscription model. Fyi nobody likes those."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been using Splitwise for years and I don't use it often, except for the occasional group trip expense. I was surprised to find out that the app is limited to 3x entries per day now, which severely limits usage. As someone who doesn't use it often, I cannot justify getting a subscription for this service. It was a great app, but not so great anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Congrats to the splitwise team from destroying their app. Completely unusable without yet another monthly subscription of $4/month. Ten second video ad between expenses, limit of 3 a day, no full history.... Your app replaces a simple Excel sheet, so best of luck monetizing that. Yet another good thing ruined by greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for keeping count of multiple expenses when doing group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a free app but now is being made to monetize and terrorize people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horseshit system now where they give you a limit of daily expenses so you can be forced to pay money ... Nice job tanking reviews"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app everyday to manage household expenses. Also used it to manage holiday expenses with friends. However, recent predatory changes to the commercialisation of the app have made this useless. Limited expenses per day, advertisements etc unless you subscribe, which is very expensive for what you get. What a fall from grace. Shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good. Saves a lot of money and potential misunderstandings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for any accounts maintenance within friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"recommend . nice app to keep track of money between group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Limited transactions and ads are frustrating. They only advertise the fact they want you to pay for more convenience, that used to be free. I'm looking into alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy way to split the payments! Handy and intuitive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Genius app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many features hidden behind pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limited use in free account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Summarily changed app functionality to ridiculous levels like only allowing addition of 3 transactions/day. They didn't have the courtesy of emailing and notifying long term users about this change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolut unnutzbar ohne Pro. Maximal 3 Einträge pro Tag möglich."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful during trip with friends, simplified and accurate calculations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asks you to wait before every entry and 5 max entries per day unless of course you buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a friendly app. Always trying to sale there premium facility forcefully. Pathetic service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates have made this app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise just sent a spam message to my friends a week after I unsuccessfully tried adding our group expanses. Unusable and spammy at this moment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit the number of transactions to record to just 5?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app since 6-7 years and It was my go to app... Recently they limited the core functionality making this app useless unless you pay for subscription. Now me and a lot of the people just hate this app. They could just have shown ads instead of limiting the access 🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You could add Litt more options like grouping based on name given or searching based on description.how the amount got transferred when simplification is on Not everything for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They kept money for using it and there is no time app purchase fee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really simple, really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't want to register need guest option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it is paid DONT DOWNLOAD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now the app just annoys for monthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and so helpful. Saves so much time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable after the latest update limits no. of transactions to 4, unless you pay £4/month for Pro. Even if I pay up, I would not expect everyone I share expenses with to do the same - thus, truly unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting limit to transactions is not worth making app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used splitwise for years and it was a great way to settle expenses after group trips. However the recent monetization rollout is frustrating and frankly greedy. I uninstalled immediately after the 3 transaction limit was introduced. This is a glorified excel spreadsheet, not worth paying for a ""pro"" version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became worst app to earn Money. I have used the app before it was nice. Ads are acceptable but for every expense and limited expense per day or you have to upgrade with money. Sorry but you might loose your rating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst as it don't allow ,4 entry per day. Ask to purchase subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful with group that travels"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"حیف که بخشای مهمش پولی شده و باید نسخه پریمیوم بگیرید اما با این حال این برنامه برای حساب کتابای دنگی بسیار عالی و کارآمد هستش و از آپشن های بسیار خوبی برخورداره"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"sometimes little bit confusing. 😕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is an excellent app. But one important feature should be added. There should be an option for auto reminder as weekly or monthly like that for the group members who owes something."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years but the app became recently unusable without the paid plan. Moving away from this app, I do not recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"unusable without paying..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 transactions per day is a buzzkill. Ppl gonna look for alternative for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The things they've added to make you try and buy a pro account make it extremely user unfriendly, only able to add 4 expenses a day and everytime you do there's a 10 second wait. Don't get it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrendous business practices pushing people to purchase pro version of such a simple app. And for what reason"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"well. this used to be a free financial app for taking ones expenses and splitting it many different ways. fantastic features, really had the lot. but now booting up good ole reliable i see things have changed. you get 7 ""free"" expenses to add to the list but you have to watch a 10 second advertisement between each of them. when you completed your 7 ""free"" items you will be blocked from adding more items unless you purchase premium edition. another fall from greatness."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used to love this app. 3* because I still use it and what I used to love is still available, but now functionality has been subtracted from the free tier of the app. I'm not willing to pay $5/mo for the app to do relatively simple calculations for me. If the ridiculous 10 second waits and expense limits persist it is quite likely I'll be doing my own addition and division from now on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be goos now changed to charge for basic features, instant uninstall. Garbage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very much convinient to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great tool to have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Frustratingly small limit to daily expenses. Why would I upgrade to simply use the app in the only way it's functionally designed for? And when you can add expenses, there's a 10 second wait. Using it begrudgingly at the moment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to record."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"its fine, don't worry bout it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The day for split wise doesn't follow 12 night change per calendar day..big it seems"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily entry limit is making me leave the app. Monthly premium is too expensive!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good and useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to share the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable and greedy. The app has changed to significantly limit the number of transactions per day, sometimes it's as few as three or four. This app is fundamentally broken, an alternative will soon take over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app, especially in larger groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good app, but simplify debts doesn't seem to be working anymore? I've used it before without any issues so I'd think something broke 🤔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses per day for free? Ya this is ridiculous. No thanks 👋🏻 Use Splid everyone!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Free add expenses are too low in number"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Essential app. Use it daily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need subscription to add pictures and to do more than a couple expenses a day now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit the number of expenses one can put enter in one day... This did not used to be a limit. Why be so greedy and want people to pay for a simple service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is one of the apps that I've been using for as long as I can remember and has consistently performed well. I use it most for trips and to split household expenses with my partner. The app has some weird quirks, but overall it makes my life much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use as a free user now, I'll switch to pen and paper"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for Managing partner finance and friends holiday trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Unable to see the group expenses even after being added to the group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be so good, but just annoying now. The daily limit and 10 second timer are ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All features are now restricted to pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years, and it has always been a reliable tool for managing shared expenses. However, the recent cap limiting expenses to only three per day is unexpected and disappointing. This restriction significantly reduces the app's usability, especially on days with multiple transactions. I hope Splitwise reconsiders this change to restore the convenience it once offered. I am looking at other options now. 😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, and working perfectly with all my day to day transactions, made calculations very easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome application, but without pro we can't use properly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for spliting costs while traveling in a group!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For account, it allows you to add only three expenses if you see a commercial. They have changed the app and it is useless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise makes sharing costs on a trip so with friends so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be great..now its just trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very helpful. This app helps to avoid money issues between friends and family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app but please keep a free version too 😇"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy way to administer and keep track of group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add more than 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now it only allows you to add 3 expenses per day and makes it take 10 seconds to add each expense (seriously!). Literally unusable, avoid. There are many free alternatives (e.g. Splid) with the same feature set."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Super frustrating. They introduced unnecessary changes just to get subscribers. Moving to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst after update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is a limit of 3 to 5 add expense each day for free user, forcing additional uses behind a premium feature. There is no indication or warning to the user before blatently locking out access to expense tracking among group of friends. There goes my mood for the day, used to be a much better app before the intoduction of Splitwise Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I tried the paid version but really not enough features to justify. I was expecting better reporting tools so I can keep track of my expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, one time fees should be an option. Both Monthly & Yearly fees are steep. I don't mind paying 50 Rs pay per use option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so good since it let you monitor expenses with family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The key function of adding expenses is limited to 4 times a day. In addition, there's a 10 second wait before you can key in expenses. These changes make the app quite unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The 10 second Splitwise pro ads on every single expense are ridiculous. I get it, company needs to make money but this is a glorified calculator app, not something I'm paying a premium subscription for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to find the app efficient. Really upset that it has become somewhat of a extortionist lately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mucho... uuuu... good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works as intended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Badly begging to get Pro version. Can't even use simple and basic features without upgrading to Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've made all good features in their premium purchase only. Limiting transactions in free version is frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise made our weekend away so much easier . Especially when your in a large group and it works everything out for you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro update and so slow and restricting users, and now, new group expenses not reflecting properly, but showing in activity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"An okay app but I can't change the language settings. It varies between English and German and so far no response from support on how to change that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Though the app is a useful tool however, mandatory purchase of Pro version is a pain. Not able to buy the subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works great, but its $5 a month to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's very good, but just a suggestion if you can add more functions like e.g. if we pay someone back there should be an option for settled so that at the end of theonth there is a proper record"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! can't think how we would survive group travels without it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription is extremely predatory, stay away at all cost. Better and cheaper alternatives! Stop this subscription madness!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to summarise group expenses. Previously it was free but I don't mind paying ₹180 once as it really saves alot of time in calculating expenses for each individual."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very convenient 😆😆"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can't put premium the way you have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good not unless u buy pro u cant use it.. too much add to updtae to pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be free, now we can only add few expenses a day. I can understand monetizing the app but the pricing is totally not reasonable. Amazon Prime costs less and gives more value, this app should not be more than 1$ a month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to use basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good but now limited options only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app, but right now Can't even add 2-3 expenses a day unless we get pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, cannot use app without paywall. Honestly a pain to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"At first this app is convenient to use but right now it has a limitation of expenses and has an ads before another transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be great but now an absolutely unusable greedy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is a flop show now. Free version is dead. Only 4 transactions can be recorded in a day. You have to watch ads first before entering data. I have switched to 'Splid'."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app to split bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super detailed app! would be nice if there would be a feature to add people just with a name and no email, so that you don't have to wait for all people to register first before adding group expenses. information who paid for what, how much and whom can get lost in bigger groups edit: thanks for the tip!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helps organize payments, never had problems with free version limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app, but removing functionality from it have made it unpleasant to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep balance when traveling together or roommates sharing expenses. So easy to use. can also use for groups!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"vibes. makes group trips and roommate life so much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app. so so handy for keeping track of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app for keeping track of individual payments between myself and four friends, I highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just Perfect ❤️❤️❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add any expenses. Switching to another app. Don't bother with this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"such a useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No way to pay without setting up a bank account which needs your ancestral history, or shell out for pro app. :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses in the free tier per day?! totally unusable..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great app,nowadays too much adds and annoying timer option has made me to uninstall this like never want to download it again.Will look forward for other apps like Settle Up. This one is not recommended 😕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It is a great app to track expenses between roommates. I've been using it for years. My biggest complaint is they've recently added ads for their pro version whenever you add an expense. This slows down the main feature of the app and adds an unnecessary inconvenience to just try and get you to buy pro. Disappointing after using it for nearly 4 years now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been a user of Splitwise for over a decade and it's great app.. but I don't understand why the owners are getting so greedy. I mean everyone needs to make money and free versions do have some restrictions over pro/paid versions but who puts the limit on the core operations of the application. If you can't add an expense what is the use of having Splitwise. Perfect example of self destruction, that too when there are so many alternatives are available at just a flick of your finger."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hungry for money, it doesn't even allow more than 4 transactions in a day. How will it work if going on trip with group. Bad strategy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad expirience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally ruined the charm of the app, earlier it was an amazing app to share and split expenses among friends on trip. Now we all are looking for alternatives, no doubt the rating has come down to 3.2 and in future its gonna go fade like Snapdeal. Kudos greedy mfs.. Update: Use Google Pay as it has inbuilt Splitwise features with Cross platform. You can use it even if you dont have google pay UPI integrated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent and very simple to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for around decade. I just added 3 expenses and now it is asking for pro subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using SplitWise pro for about 6 months, but I don't see any need to continue as my experience with the app has been terrible. The benefits are not nearly enough to justify the cost. There are some much needed featues missing like being able to copy a transaction that occurs frequently (but not regularly), how hard is it to allow users to select an older transaction and copy it again. It's too much trouble to enter all the same details again when we already have previously."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It saves your time. It's totally worth to use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app many years. I loved it but it seems splitwise become greedy putting limitation of only 3 entries. They could offer premium feature seperate or cloud function. Or least they can offer like 10 entries a day. Hope splitwise would consider increasing limit else we have to move to other apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Locking too many features behind a subscription paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer usable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new 3 transaction limit makes this app nearly unusable. This used to be my go to app for every trip, and I convinced all my friends and family to download it for the convenience of splitting costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"so many ads and basic features are made premium have been using this app since 2018 but now it's time to find better alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good app for money settlements"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The limitations recently added for non-premium users (incl. Max number of entries) have destroyed this app's practicality. I shall be moving somewhere else, which offers the same services, but for free... (i recommended tricount). If they amed this, its a good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was superb before they got greedy and started going after subscriptions. Actively looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Took a perfect thing and made it much, much worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Kon lega ap ka subscription jab Google pay, phone pe pe ye kam free mein ho jata hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.... Great use if u live in flat and need to tract ur expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a good app but they got super greedy with their allowances for the free version. So suck em."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great minimalist and intuitive interface, great UX. I love this app and it's really useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"lifesaver for trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very usefull app for maintain expenses as a group. liked it very much. But recently thy have restricted lot of options in free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Corporate hunger"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand that any app developer needs to make profit, but right now if you don't have the pro version this app is totally useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now that they added a paywall (a subscription of all things), and limiting the amount of transactions you can add per day while also have ads and 10s wait time in-between transaction submission, Splitwise became extremely annoying to use and me and my friends are going to switch to another app like tricount or whatever is not as painful to use as Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Almost unusable without a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app, but the subscription paywall restrictions are unbelievably annoying. 5 transactions a day... I have no problem with good apps costing some money, but it should be a one-time payment, and it's fully unlocked. This is not the way. Especially for an app that most people will use a few times a year. Would love to come back to it, if they fix this mess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There have to be easier ways to monetize than alienating your userbase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 1 bill per day can be put in it., Pure waste., We eat 3 times a day and when bills are to be split in 3 times a day, it will not be possible. Then what is the use., ???? , Installed and uninstalled the same day, Lunch time., Utter waste.,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app became absolute trash: pushing the pro version down our throat after 1 expense is disgusting. Will make all my friends and family move away from this if this doesn't get changed before the next version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It asks to take pro in every single expense by showing us add everytime."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why are you guys charging us for calcuting stuff... switching to another app because of this stupidity"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Constantly trying to get you to upgrade to pro. Limits number of entries unless you upgrade to pro. The free version is a scam to try to make you pay. Just avoid!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless without the pro features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I spent half an hour to fill in all information including email address and telephone number. Then I added like four expenses and it asked me to get the paid version. What a waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a limit of 5 expenses per day is just stupid and takes away any utility of this app in its non paid version. Just make it a paid app at this point. Stupid beyond comprehension."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to swear by this app but it's become barely usable with the daily transaction limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fine app but suddenly has to give a bunch of notifications like a cry for attention. Either start an app with the intention it's free or you withholding utility behind a pay wall so customers know they should get the pro version if they love it. The sudden notifications for attention is the problem here."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful. Max entries (of about6?) now added. Still usable if you add your total expenses separately then put the total into Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible now. Limit of 3 transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's pathetic.. always asking to upgrade to Pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This would have been 5 stars a year ago. Used to be amazing to split expenses with friends on our annual girls trips, brilliant idea. But now there is a pay wall to enter over 5 expenses per day for free. Makes no sense paying for a Pro membership since this made traveling with friends easier, not a have to have. Not sure how long ago it changed since I only use once a year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"incredible app, have been using it since 2019, very nice app, it's so easy now to keep a record on all your expenses done by trip/group members, just like the way it solves all the expenses issues, it shows the spending also by segregating by its own. Amazing app, keep up the good work splitwise team...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Die App ist an sich gut aber ein Abo Modell dafür ist übertrieben. Einmalzahlung gerne aber die monatlichen Kosten sind für den gebotenen Mehrwert überzogen. Genauso wie die penetrante Werbung das Abo Modell abzuschließen."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Owes and lent details are not shown properly in the app. Once a person starts to lend after owing, the app shows ""settled"" between the 2 persons. And from that point, no matter how many bills are added, it still shows settled between the two persons. Please fix this. Also the ads and per day limits are annoying too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has become impractical, forcing to buy premium after just 3 expenses. Loads of better free alternatives out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only because of forced ads everytime you open and add expenses it's very irritating to use, admin have to take this steps seriously"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You should be able to add any number of expenses what's the point of this app if it's just doing calculation for 3 expenses I can do it as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The number of expenses that you can add without paying for the pro version is ridiculous. Will use any other competitor app from now on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now when you can only add 5 transactions per day it's useless. I would be fine to pay a one time fee for the pro version but an expensive subscription? No chance. I'll be using other apps from now on"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to keep track of group expenses. The pro version includes the ability to consolidate multiple currency expenses into a single currency. I wish charts allowed better segregation though."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. Nice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a good application, however it is charging money for just adding transactions. They could have shown ads instead of charging subscription fee. I only use it for once in awhile in 6 months. Not worth for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's very shifty of the app to allow us to make entries for some time and then suddenly ask us to upgrade. It leaves us in the lurch. Either it should ask us to upgrade before we start a trip or after finishing, it shouldn't be told that for the next one you should upgrade. Had a bad experience because of this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Been using it over a decade till recently they started to monetize the free tier. First strike was 10 seconds wait, seconds strike was no more than 2 or 3 entries from app. But I could still use their site to add expenses. With third strike they blocked addition everywhere. I don't mind watching a 10 sec ad. One can live with ads, e.g. YouTube. I don't mind paying one time fee but $5 a month 😱. Totally stopping the main action is very aggressive Bye bye splitwise. RIP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very good and nicely thought"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool for splitting costs and actually remembering to pay it back later."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"youre joking you guys are trying to money grub for a billing app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"iv been using this app for many years. suddenly main fuctionality (log expenses) became paid. all group members must buy pro membership. which in my case is 15eur/month. WOW"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app experience I've had in a long time, needlessly complicates a very simple task"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not cool to limit the number of entries per day in the free version. You lost a user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, not it's useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful application to track, calculate all your expenses specially when in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bloated and full of ads prompting to upgrade, unusable for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"A superb app for managing and recording your expenses and group expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👍💝💝💝"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful app which keeps asking for money. Disgusting app, deleted it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become fully paid. I have stopped using this app. Downloaded settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Solía usar la aplicación para dividir gastos con amigos y familiares en viajes. Funcionaba muy bien y la prefería sobre otras alternativas, incluso con alguna espera o anuncio. Sin embargo, ahora el límite diario de 5 gastos hace que la aplicación sea completamente inutilizable, tendré que cambiar a otra alternativa."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cant even more than 3 transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very convenient and simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop begging for money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just like every 1 star review. Used to be good but now, like every freaking company in the world, wants a subscription model for basic stuff. Gets you hooked first to demand money later. F... that!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a very good and main reason I use it is that there are no bothersome ads. Edit1: this was my original review. However, it is only a shadow of its former self. Everything is paid now. We can't even post all the expenses we make.. Utterly useless. Uninstalling it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"""Free"" app which is designed to be useless if you dont pay by giving you a 10 second ad for every expense you set, and a maximum of 5 expenses a day. And all thats achieved is a waste of 5 of my precious minutes, plus the extra minute to review bomb and uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Premium is too expensive for the User Experience offered with this app. On the go, you want to quickly add expenses and not spend time creating a group first - other apps do this in a better way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limits don't make sense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I love this app. But the main reason to give 1 star that they are pushing the user to buythe pro version , by limiting the expenses addition"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now that they've paywalled the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"At this point just make it a paid app lmao"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had been using it for a while. Very annoying to have only a few transactions limit per day.. Paid subscription is too expensive for what it offers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The way ahead this company choose to puch their premium version would go as the most pathetic attempt at selling a product, should have explored other options to sell their premium version rather than making the whole user version so bad that I don't even feel this using their product let alone payibg anything extra. Either make you app fully paid or stop with this pathetic user experience!!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"barely useable anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much irritated with the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app but recently became more commercial"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The free version is so limited that it's pointless. Immediately moved-on to an alternate app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Have been using it for 8 trips and this app deserves a 5 star. Highly recommended for anyone traveling in a group. ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Greedy service. Everything is locked down behind a greedy paywall.. I would love to pay for this service, as long as the fee is reasonable. Which it's currently far from."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"make it free again or minimum premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful tool that takes all the faff out of organising any group holiday, event, or household. Would highly recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now needing a Pro subscription to enter more than a few expenses in a day, and interrupting with Ads has made the app completely impractical. It is unrealistic to expect a group of people all to purchase an app, as would be required for it to be useful. After this expense is settled I will be deleting it. Such a shame, it was a great app, but certainly not worth $75 per year. Goodbye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much greedy app. Instead of blocking people to submit expenses, find some extra features for paid customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Make atleast one group member to access and add unlimited expenses between other members"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app monetization strategy is too aggressive. I finished a trip and tried to add a items all at once and can't do it because now there is a limit of 4 expenses. Absurd!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app. No more of one person trying to pay for everything or someone in the group not pulling their weight. Makes everything so fair and so easy to calculate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new updates have made it annoying to the point of useless for free users. Find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really takes the hassle out of group payments. My friends and I use it when we travel abroad together (once or twice a year) and it just means one person can pick up the bill and we sort it all out at the end. Does what we need it to do pretty intuitively."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 second timer to add an expense and a 5 daily limit on the free version, what a joke. Another good app ruined, time to move elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It is very helpful in managing expenses within friend circle or with roomates, But the Pro subscription thing and daily expense limit really suck"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to Understand; does exactly what you need it to do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Moving to a subscription service to be able to add more than 3 transactions a day is ridiculous. A one-time payment would be one thing, but I'll probably stop using it now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Super functional and used to be perfect, but now limits free users to adding 5 transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 entries per day now on the free version? As another reviewer said, if you miss 1-2 days it is now impossible to catch up without buying premium. What a shame to destroy what was a very popular app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? No thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app untill it's limited the daily transaction updation and keep on irritating for pro membership"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never seen an app make it self so unusable just to get users to buy premium. I thought YouTube was bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Zero star waste"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gave 1 rating because couldn't give 0 rating as limiting expenses to 3 per day is a basic feature and asking to join premium which to costly and not worth."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What was the point of making everything paid that too such a high fee all of a sudden, perfect recipe for loosing users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great idea, love the functionality, tracking expenses with friends and family especially easy. Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not at all good. Does not allow us put more than 5 expenses in the free version. So got a better app than this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to add more expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expenses are deleted automatically from the groups and now I am not able to see any group's expenses on the app. i have raised the support ticket on the support mail. Please look into that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Over the years more and more features get put behind paywalls. The prices change too often. This app got useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For normal expences it is not good as after some limit compulsory we need to buy their paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is so commercial that it allows you to add expenses with add in between and after adding very few it will tell you to upgrade to pro as your daily limit is completed. Such a worst experience having this updated in this way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is greedy... Stop asking for money always..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hi This is urgent. After I add passcode to app it suddenly stopped working I think it is bug in the app please contact me for more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pricing is stupid for this type of app. Will be changing apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A no-brainer app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now ads and a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very meh nowadays"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and handy for setttling group expenses on holiday"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a brilliant app.i used it while on holiday with family and found it excellent and simple to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to manage split expenses within friends and family 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect tooll"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting the amount of transactions is ridiculous. I'm all for adding functionality for paid users but making it worse for free users doesn't make me want to pay, it makes me want to stop using your app. At this point, I'm just going to use Google sheets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app... Thought it would ease the process of splitting...made it very difficult.. I would have had manually did the calculation within half an hour...it took me 3 days to get everyone into app and get it finalized."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy to use and a game changer for shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app helps friends stay friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience for so easy to reach daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for keeping track of everything while travelling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. works seamlessly. it can get bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's simple."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer viable in the free version since the daily expense adding limit has been added. This will cost you a lot of casual users for this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Developers have ruined the app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super experience with this app , glade to have this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for recording and allocating costs between a group of people. I have been using it for a few years now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I just deleted it , I used to love the app didn't know about this update. Ads come after every 2 transaction worst user experience , uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now I have to wait 10 seconds before adding a new expense. And can only add 5 expenses per day. Keeps asking me to upgrade to pro. I would have upgraded if the app didn't have these limits. Moving to a different expenses app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is really a time saving and very usefull application for our generation. I really appreciate it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's very useful and quick way to share it ..it's very helpful to bachelor and easy way to look on. your spending. it's good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version got completely nuked with the last update. Full screen ads with 10s timers, maximum 3 expenses a day which is completely unrealistic... I'd rather not use this app and recommend Splid than ever pay for this bloated app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"osm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting expenses per day for free versions is a terrible idea!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app, I don't have to keep track of who owes who what!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even add basic expenses now without getting the limit. Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Suddenly daily limitation forcing to pay for the pro 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without upgrading to pro the normal version of app looks useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowing to add 2-3 expenses a day is quite greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 3 expenses can be added now. Simply outrageous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best apps working very well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Horrible that they put a limit to add expenses on the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The push to pro is ridiculous. Add more features rather than lock existing ones behind a pay wall. Will be moving out of this platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"indispensable!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Such a simple to use app but they ruined it with 3 transactions per day limit. I was happy and comfortable but the premium sub is just trash - no good features so it all just sums up to ""pay for what you already have been using"""
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is very bad Its ask for pro version to pay after serval entries. Design is also bad, just few calculations that can be done with calculator app even easily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to work on their pricing model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good to handle money expenses when going out with a group of friends and settle once the trip/vacation is done 🙌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A daily limit of 4 Entries and a stupendous pricing. You are a glorified excel sheet, I'll pay you 5€ once and that's that. Not 3€ / month or 30€ / year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep tab on group as well as individual expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"suck their monetization strategy, and everything is limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Constant pushing and handicapping of utility of app unless you pay an unreasonable subscription fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"great tool for keeping track of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they limited the ""add expenses"" - literally beats the whole point of its use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling the app, horrible way to lose clientele by introducing such a ridiculous limit to the number of transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using it for 10 years changing it to 1 star due to the recent subscription model. Bye bye splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No of expenses that can be added per day is reduced to just 5-7. Very bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Add Splitwise Rate th is app add world madical discovary Rating audio book stores browser watching live work Reviews are public and include your acaount and device info learn more add Read more google pay Relevantparty partnership Requirment providers yahooloadgardedestap loadgarde taxas device pokel taxas holder games loadgarde ownership mob ile Rearchard all transctions loadgade notefecation transcribed loadgarde bible helper Ebrahimalysalam messangers Replacement madical trafic truned on t"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the limit for daily expense to be entered made the app horrible to use , looking for a new alternative ASAP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be grate. Now forcing users to become ""pro"" at 10 euro a month. I just want to split bills, i don't care about insights. Bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a paywall with 3 transactions a day probably seems worst move my marketing. I wouldn't have had a problem with a one time lifetime payment for using pro but a subscription model for such an app seems really unnecessary. The app itself hasn't had any great updates in past 5+ years to even make it appealing to pay for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What do you mean reached the daily expense limit? You have one job. You track expenses. If you are not gonna do that, then let export my data in Excel. I will stop using the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily transaction limit is the most unwise decision that the team made."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So disappointed with the max transactions per day and the push to pay for pro. Have been using this app for years and will now seek alternatives because this was not communicated and is not enough daily transactions and will not be paying for a ""pro"" version. Back to spreadsheets for splitting expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app..works flawlessly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the new free barrier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously it was good, but now it has become really irritating by adding pro, after each expense it says to take pro. Really irritates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really great way yo take the pressure off working out expenses between friends and family for holidays 😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was better previously but now it just a tourcher with Pro version, stared looking for opensource free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit on adding expenses is such a greedy act by developers. Screw them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limiter number of expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they put in the restrictions... The app is simply too much per month when we're a group using it... It's really a shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app! But hard force for user to buy pro is something not expected from Sliptwise, and the sad part is they've limit restriction to add expenses per day! Very bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm very disappointed in this app. My friends and I have been using it for splitting expenses on trips and my wife and I use it for splitting our expenses. I paywall ads were annoying, but to discover that now how many expenses I can add in a day is capped to only 5, I've decided to look for other options. I'm really disappointed. In typical fashion, something that was great is now awful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get that you want me to switch to pro. But I don't use it enough to want that. Plus, there are many other actual FREE apps such as tricout that i don't get your plan.... it's one thing to keep asking to switch to pro it's a whole other when you say i need to wait a day after 5 entries! The only option is downloading an old version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"To expensive for using once a year and free version too restricted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why, why, WHY would you monetize & cripple a simple calculation app?? That too as a service, and not a one-time purchased product??? You just lost a 10 yr long customer, team 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed policies to use only 3 free transaction...desperate to convert to pro...other free apps are available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why does this good app wants to go to it's own graveyard? Because of the ads situations, it's gotten worse day by day. Can't even use the app anymore. Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously ..a subscription fee .. guys.. will find another app.. thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The paywall is very annoying. I don't mind buying the app but having a subscription for such a simple app is stupid. Will be looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add things without subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app years ago. It was great. Made every roommate to install it. Now it has 10 seconds rule to add an expense! What?? Really? Pathetic. Will move soon to alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using splitwise from the last 2 years. The application is great and helpful to maintain all the expenses. I am grateful to the support team to resolve the issue i faced just by replying my email. Wonderful support team 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but since the limit on number of transactions, using this app has become frustrating..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super useful tool; once you use it youll never go back !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay wall on transaction nos, seriously?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why everything has to be pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am so tired of Pro push. It made the app barely usable. I've been a loyal user for over 5 years, and you guys were to ask me pay $10-15 once to unlock Pro I would gladly do it. But basically torturing customers to give you $5 a month forever??? Pretty much a streaming service price? Fyi, people on reddit are already discussing / developing alternative apps. I am going go switch soon as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used splitwise for almost 10 years. Asking me now to pay monthly fee for something as simple as putting some basic expenses is unreasonable. Making us pay a onetime fee was something I would consider but not this. Utterly disappointed!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Make it free again! Does it's job extremely well, clean and easy to use UI, detailed history Incase you ever need it. Good job devs!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With recent changes, this app is worthless. Don't bother downloading it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They got greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but they limited amount of expense entries+ even to add an entry you need to wait (they don't even show you adv) the pricing policy for pro version feels greedy,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very nice aap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't like the daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version has barely any functionality. Lots of better options around."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app because of the paywall. 6€ / month? HBO Max is cheaper and they stream GBs of movies instead of a few numbers. It's ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without premium this app is of no help. Won't let us even add 4 transactions a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No proper UI. First"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't want to pay for something which was free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would be a great app if they didn't decide to make it useless by making you pay for adding more than like 3 expenses per day. Unusable in this state. At least make it an ad break instead of locking users out of it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love this app. It makes our girls trip so much easier when it comes to splitting the cost for EVERYTHING! Only gave it 4 stars because we couldn't use Venmo anymore to settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have for friend groups and on group trips. Works great and the freemium model is fair."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using from 2015. Now stopped using after you limit the number of transactions to 4 per day. I am the only treasurer/bills person in my group. Everyone wants total share as soon as a trip is over. I am now telling them to wait for 4 more days to post 16 transactions. Too bad initiative. Will be moving to Venmo groups/other free apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really liked this app but monetization became too agressive, can't recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding paid subscription is fine but don't limit the previous features. Moving to a different app now because of this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but not anymore anymore. Yet another example of a good app that goes down onve they get greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They're not allowing to add any more expenses after 5 additions without subscribing to pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"expense limit is too low, right now is only allowing 4 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Just terrible now. Long time user of this great app but now they've made it all but useless by the limits and ads introduced. Very sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Needed to use the app for traveling with friends. One of the friends ended up setting everything up over three days, as the free version is extremely limited in functionality. Basically just a glorified Excel sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limit of daily expenses added to standard version of app is forcing me to use a alternative. Previously used Splitwise when travelling with partner, friends and family. Uploading all expenses/costs during a trip is no longer feasible as you max out daily upload number easily when travelling or on holiday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Got worse and worse. Only 4 free entries so it doesn't even work for a trip with friends unless you pay. Better and more user friendly apps out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I was a usual user but offlate their restrictions on adding no of expenses is a pain. That's cheapest way to make ppl buy pro subs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"has a daily limit for adding expeses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Earlier it was good app but now they allow only 4 entries per day And splitwise pro is very costly against its utility"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes payments and group activities so seamless and easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved it when it was free. now it's just 💩 go with settle up free and Better features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was useful before but after they started taking charge. No like to use now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every update feels like a target o. User experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye bye.. thanks for forcing me not to use the app after all these years by telling us to upgrade to pro after entering each and every expense. There are other app that we can use; you just made a fool out of yourself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until the daily expense limit. Don't bother downloading, it's no longer useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely idiotic ad and premium policy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Irritating pro version ads and daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Costs money after entering 4 expenses. Not usable in the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using this forever, it's an excellent expense management app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life east"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Useful app but since they've added a very restrictive limit to the amount of expenses you can add per day, plus arbitrary waiting periods between adding each expense while using the free version of the app (I'm capped at 4 per day), I'll be searching for an alternative app with the same basic functionality. You should too unless you're willing to pay for a Pro account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, works as advertised!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was a fan of Splitwise, even though it had its quirks with invites, had to fight with people to use it instead of Tricount. Now everyone in the group needs to pay to participate, which makes this app super expensive. What an idiotic move. Guess it os Tricount then."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Adding limit to group expansion is really bad move.hope you will recover"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be useful once upon a time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be a fantastic app that I have used for years. But the limit of 3 transactions per day for the free version and the high price for the paid version make alternatives a better option. Moving to an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"At this point they're taking free features and making them paid. Or making it less pleasant to use it for free. Capitalizing on existing free-before features is not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What's the point of this app if can't put more than 4 expenses without paying. Ads are okay but paying up for it absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really ? You could have put more ads. But, 4 transactions per day??? Outrageous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As simple as it can get, many options to split, easy to settle and line the paypal integration"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"As with all the other reviews, I used to love this app and recommended it to all my friends. The changes like the forced wait to add an expense and popups are annoying, but a daily cap of 4 expenses means I'm going to have to stop using it. A real shame as it's been so useful for the last few years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited transactions expenses defeat the purpose of this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app! Made it so much easier than trying to tally everything at the end of a trip!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started as free app now everthing is paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to record the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love the App for what it offers, but off late it has become really irritating to ask to take Pro desperately. It was offering some Features for it made sence. But now it is stooping soo low that it's become unusable. Having a limit of being able to enter only 4 Transactions per day 🤔🤔. Add some feature for the value. Otherwise there are better alternatives. Don't assume that you are irreplaceable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad. Money hunger, expensive subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling. Have used Splitwise many years now it only allows a few transactions before charging for pro and giving ads. Now it's annoying and inconvenient (exactly the opposite of what you need in an app). I use it sparingly for trips with friends and family, not worth the cost. We are all switching to a more convenient alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and intuitive to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sadly another app that has been taken over by parasites with MBAs. You are now limited to 3 transactions a day as a free user, which basically makes this app useless. I guess I go back to excel now. Good riddance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become useless without Pro subscription. They have removed the basic feature of adding multiple expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage app after they added the premium version. Used to be very good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Split in group is done wrongly. It makes 1st person pay extra, If 1 cent is left out, and it is with every entry in group transportation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to take the stress out of shared holidays. No more spreadsheets required. Simple to use and everyone can see who owes what. Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy developers. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"We can make only 4 transactions per day without opting for pro. This includes 2 transactions for which we have to wait 10 seconds each. Lame. At least let us add 10 transactions per day. If this improves, I will definitely change to 5 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The 10 second wait periods between each exoense and 3 per day expense limits make this app unusable. Deleting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy tool to keep balances in check, weather on a trip with friends or keeping family things in order. have been using it for a while and am very satisfied. good job Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be great, I'd happily say it used to be my favorite accounting app, but now they decided to run it into the ground and make it garbage. Expense limits with a delay timer? Splitwise is trying to stab you in the back by making their app hardly usable, unless you fork over a SUBSCRIPTION FEE. No one-time options, either. Another story of a greedy company stripping features and putting them behind a paywall. Once I find a replacement, I'll never pay your subscription again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It only let you add 4 expances per day in free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app was really fantastic, but It is no longer meant for a group of friends to use on an annual vacation. The transactions per day limitation in the free version is restrictive to the point of not being useful and every single screen has an ad. I'm not sure who their target audiences is at $40 a year, but that's incredibly expensive for our personal needs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App for group holidays."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly Perfect"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit for adding expenses is laughable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, but now it's intentionally frustrating to it's users by making you wait 10 seconds between expenses and setting a limit on how many you can do in a day. Now expensing takes me double the time and across multiple days. At this point I should just switch to a Google spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are destroying the experience. DO NOT INSTALL"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Has something changed? Cant delete charges. There is a strike thru saying it was deleted but have to open the charge to find that out. What happened to converting currency?It seems like it is becoming more difficult. I see charges from a year ago that have been settled. Why can't I delete them?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really enjoyed using this app, but the aggressive push to get people to buy pro means I'm going to an alternative app. Currently Splitwise only lets you add 4 expenses a day which means the free version is now useless. Really poor decisions for monetisation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good and I used to really enjoy using it. They've completely gutted it to add the premium functionality, though. Disappointing that a transaction history app would make you wait 10 seconds to add each transaction (with a daily limit!). Ridiculous. 2 stars because it still works as advertised otherwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add a few expenses per day even though it shows ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Effectively useless without premium now. New users, look elsewhere. This is a dying app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was one of my favorite apps, but the pay walls added recently made the user experience just terrible. The subscription price doesn't make any sense, and there isn't a 1-time payment option. Unfortunately, after many years been a happy user, I'm having to migrate to another bill splitting app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I suppose the makers of the app is being greedy. the app does no serve the purpose offered for the oro model. And most of the people just want this as a simple calculator. NOT WORTH IT TO BUY THE PRO MODEL AND THE APP IS PRETTY USELESS NOW AS WE CANNOT ADD MORE THAN $ TRANSACTIONS IN A DAY."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app, just download and learn how to use it, and you are so ready for every activity with friends that involved money splitting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"tool very usefull and well done"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have used this app 6 years ago and it had been great, now they intentionnaly made it worse to funnel free users to pro. Capped the daily limit of splits at 5 and I have to wait for a forced timer of 10 seconds each time?! Add new features, make the input faster and users will pay, not make the once great experience garbage unless paid. Will search for a competitor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is basically useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for traveling with friends and family members"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Imit there transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing users for paid service is worst. There will be a better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app as it made it so easy to split expenses, especially for going on a trip with friends, etc. However, after the recent updates to the app, you are limited to around 4 expenses a day. Sucks now, and $75 usd for a yearly subscription is outrageous! Have been using the app since 2015. A shame. Will be looking elsewhere. I'd understand pay $20 for the life of using the app but not a yearly premium for something which isn't an essential app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. No worries about expenses or forgetting anything. Thank you and keep it up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful for group trips, highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy app.. Aap jis kaam ka hai usi k liye paisa leta hai.. Chindi chor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the new limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"🚮"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Paid account is amazing. A glitch free, well designed, pretty much intuitive and ever innovating app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app - makes splitting costs super easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally just had me on an endless loop of verification screens just to try reset my password"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for keeping a track on expenses when spending in a group. Especially the spreadsheet generated by the app makes things easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to control expenses for a group of people, for a trip or an event, at different countries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was good earlier but now so many bugs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really bad buisness strategy, suddenly restricted the number of entries and started asking for money and that's not even one time payment , they are asking for monthly or yearly payment for basic services not for premium services. really bad. dont know who guided you this but it gonna impact you user base badly. it's been more than 6 years I have been using this app bcz of its best services but now what they have done is not acceptable. i will wait for their revised policy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise set limit for free account...!!! I think company have now start only paid service and removed the all the free features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pathetic experience in frew version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great way to avoid continuous exchanges of money while out or away with friends. Quick and easy to use, brilliant! Sue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go-to app for trips, sharing bills with flatmates and friends and so on... But now they introduced this daily limit which destroyed the whole experience. Will unistall in a month if they don't change it back to like before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have using splitwise for over half a decade and it is unusable in the current iteration. having limits on per day additions is horrendous. will have to look for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free app is no longer valuable, the push to upgrade (you can track only three daily expenses) is ridiculous. It's sad, I won't use this app anymore. I would have been ok with watching ads to be allowed to add more expenses, maybe they should reconsider their business model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to use Splitwise, but the recent changes have made it significantly worse. The two issues are the daily transaction limit and the inability to convert currencies. The pricing model is also completely off. I would pay a small one-off fee, or perhaps even a small yearly fee for a good app for splitting expenses, but they charge far more than it is worth to me. There are good alternatives available that don't have these limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There were no limitations to the free version when I first installed it. Now they're getting worse at every update. I'd be okay with buying the pro version if it was a one off purchase, but a subscription is a no go for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed for money, can't add exp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to share expensis during trip or with colleagues"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much monetization, remember you are only used to divide a trip's expenses that even a python coder can do by learning for 3-4 months. You just added a lot of unnecessary stuff to sell. Not needed, stop capitalizing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the concept. It's convenient and fun. No headaches for the group participants involved. Recommended for travel in group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app and now it's useless unless you pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has been one of the best apps I have used for recording my transactions with friends and groups. I have been using this app since 2017. But the latest restrictions for pro-version made me disappointed. I decided to uninstall and quit the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fix that venmo integration faster than 2 months later and we can talk"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why premium membership for this🤦🏻‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"was a great experience until they put up everything basic and essential under a paywall recently does not serve the basic purpose of yhe group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for dividing lunch and other expenses among group of people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be one of the best travel apps! I recently downloaded it again to log some expenses for a trip and discovered that there's a daily cap of 3 expenses (with a required advertisement viewing). Beyond that you must pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee. I cannot recommend this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Kindly allow more than 5 transactions per day. Its a totally useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not satisfied with limit option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be good, but has been ruined by monetization and now allows only 2 expenses to be added per day with a ""free"" account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app! Makes splitting expenses so easy & seamless. App is user-friendly & super convenient!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time you go to put an entry, there will be ads and a limit of 10 entries. It destroys the whole purpose to track expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changes in paywalled services without prior notice to long time users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable with limited expenses per day. Have deleted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money minded now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app saves the hassle of remembering who paid for what and how much the other person ows you .... need some more features in free app 🫣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Freezes or crashes all the time. Bad UI too. So frustrating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work with venmo, then PayPal integration kept causing it to crash. Also not intuitive navigation around the app. Maybe it's just not set up well for Android? Will delete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can show ads or keep the price of pro reasonable. It's a basic app, you can't ask more than YT/spotify. Dumb managers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just play ads instead of limiting the number of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Losing its worth with its 5 expenses per day unless ""premium"". Deleting it. Uselss now. The one who suggested to premium it did a good job to bring down the rating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Random people who I don't know are (clearly mistakenly) adding me to their expense groups without consent. The app should not allow that - they should have a verification check."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad! Not allowed to add unlimited expense is worst feature! That's the whole point of the app and it's the worst feature! Don't use this app there are other apps which are not as greedy as them!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until paywalls were introduced. Now it's unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app and very user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to my favourite app and I recommended it to everyone I travelled with. Now that they've limited the number of transactions you can record, it is almost unusable. The fact that the pro version is a subscription service rather than a one time purchase is what made me switch to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice app, but the limitations of the free version are insane. Should be at least 5 transactions per day. Maybe consider adding a tier between Free and Pro?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't use it after three expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app.. And helpped us in our trip and made it easier 👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"SplitWise I such a convenient, user friendly, and functional application. I have been using it since I started staying with my roommates. External easy to use, filled with actionable items, designed such that there's no need to communicate your expenses outside of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started charging a whole FIVE DOLLARS MONTHLY 💀 if you don't fork up the cash, the app is pretty much useless for trips. RIP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I was having issues collecting payments on a weekly basis from a dynamic group of friends. There were people owing amounts to me all the time. This app has come to me as such a blessing - if maintains history of amounts owed. Awesome."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They didnt have to nuke daily people with limited expense and force to buy pro. I would rather settle up everyone and find an alternative app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Insanely expensive for an app that only lets you split three transactions a day on the non pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To echo a lot of the other reviews here, it used to be a good way of tracking expenses on a trip, but now has too many ads, limits on free accounts make it hard to use, and too many of the features are behind a paywall now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unable to subscribe from India. Plus I don't need it for the year, I use it primarily on trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app! It did what you wanted it to do and it did it perfectly. Now the free version is a fraction of what it once was. I absolutely despise companies that do this. Should've thought of a better business model in the first place. Gonna look for a new app. If anyone has any recommendations, let me know. 🙈"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was great, but now you have to pay for everything. Tricount is my new go-to. As good as splitwise used to be ✌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My friends and I used to use this app for every trip to track shared expenses. The recent pro tier and limiting the free tier makes it extremely frustrating and almost unusable. Limited transactions per day, making me wait 10s to enter another transaction. Ruining am otherwise fantastic app by trying to force me to use an overpriced paid tier...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates have added pointless barriers to the free version and made this unusable. Totally pointless except as a money grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Mann muss jetzt 3€ pro Monat zahlen um diese App normal verwenden zu können. Man kann pro Tag nur 3 Ausgaben hinzufügen. Wird daher deinstalliert."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise was an excellent app for splitting costs between parties. I logged in today to find it's that's trying to figure out how to monetize itself. Splitwise is hiding functionality behind a paywall, timers and artificial time limits that didn't exist a year ago. I hope the devs reconsider and put it a $5 premium option or go for something more reasonable. I'm switching to excel spreadsheets, this is not worth the self inflicted inconveniences the devs have added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No nonsense app. Very easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"zindagi aasan kardi hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined a good app by introducing a limit on the fundamental feature of the app in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Hoping to see individual expense settle up option, as it's missing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The forced subscription is cringe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden, they started limit on expenses entries, not at all good, had to shift all my expenses to other app. Very bad behavior"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is very complex to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was really great, have used it a few years for tons of stuff (and still do for 2 person living expenses, grocery, etc). But now it doesn't even remotely calculate things right for 3 people if any purchase isn't an exact 3 way split =( Huge problem as we use it for group trips where some purchases aren't even or don't include everybody!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"payment process sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting on the non paid members expense entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good until they start asking for a monthly subscription so you can have access to the basic stuff. If it was a one off payment, it would happily pay. I guess that's how capitalism goes nowadays... Just so you all know there are free app alternatives to Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but I guess nobody pays for Premium so, instead of making premium more attractive or the app a one time payment they decided to make the free version significantly worse to the point where it's unusable. Why not having a one time purchase app instead? Or some ad displayment for the free version? Or making more useful funcions for the premium version so that you can also budget all sort of expenses similar to YNAB?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new limit this app lost its usage for me. 30€ per year is way too much for someone like me who uses it for around 4 holidays or the like a year. 30€ for lifelong usage I would say would be worth it but this, no thanks. I will find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day is just stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"invaluable app can't do without it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be such an amazing app, it was simple but effective. Now, they limit the number of transactions you can add on there if you're a free user. For how essential of an app this used to be, I wouldn't have minded a 1-time unlock fee to get access to unlimited transactions. The subscription gives you access to a whole bunch of (in my opinion) junk. No one was subscribing before and no one still is. Charge me $20 for unlimited transactions forever and it's a done deal. Got to go look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app, but now they bombard with up selling. Today they say that Venmo broke integration, but I really wonder if they are happy it's broken so that people might choose the Splitwise payment option. I use this because my friend likes it, but I prefer not to use it anymore. 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am using this application for few years now and the application is exceptional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Usefull app, recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had been a big fan for nearly 7-8 years, but the new limits are absolutely awful. Essentially unusable without paying for the pro version subscription, not even a one off. Now embarrassed that I spruiked it to people for years. Greed ruins another great app, moving onto something else now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I enjoy Splitwise, and my wife and I use it often. However, the sad thing is if we do a group outing. Everyone in that group needs to pay or they will reach a limit. I don't mind paying. However, now I have to add the transaction for people who are not paying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"ใช้งานง่ายครับ เข้าใจง่าย มีระบบแจ้งเตือนยอดใช้จ่าย เวลาเคลียร์เงินก็ง่าย"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor UI in android."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app used to be our go-to app on our travels for settling up the expenses for years. It has been updated so you can't add more than 4 (four!) expenses daily, and the third and fourth expense is delayed by a 10 second timer. Well, I guess that's the end of us using the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. Now they started charging even for the basic features. It would have been okay of they started charging for new features but this is annoying to say the least."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Imagine limiting expenses per day. What a stupid decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging a bomb for the paid version,that too on subscription basis Keeping a limit of 5 expenses per day for a free version is a joke. I am uninstalling and going for other better free version apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice application 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect for vacation with friends 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's not possible to add income of a group. Example: Someone brings beer to a party for free. But the beer is mixed with other bottles. We want to split depending on how much each group member drinks. But the way the app is designed we have to split the costs of the bought beer when the costs are generated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for almost a decade. It's a nice utility app, but the current restriction added by the company just makes it useless for regular users. A premium subscription for the very basic functionality it existed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit is the cause of all problems"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Here's another app that requires more personal info which I'm not a fan of. It takes time to add multiple expenses and you are limited to 10 transactions per day before monthly subscription. Albeit, it's transparent. Timing of delivery is more old school than other bank apps that are more direct and funds generally available within 24 hours. I used this app for a trip but really see it more useful for one off splits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"attaching the bill to the expense was a good feature, but now it is in the pro version that is no good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is now basically unusable unless you subscribe to a Premium account that is ridiculously expensive. Try using your own calculator for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allow 3 transactions per day. Earlier it was free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good app then they came up with paid version and free part was useless .. i shifted then .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Useful but the new version makes it a pain to use. Countdown to add expenses and limited number of daily expenses are a deal breaker. I will move to a different app, even with a one time only payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. For friends, work, and so on. I recomend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable as a free app now, pretty much. Can only make 4 expenses a day and you get constantly spammed with ads. Terrible and dissapointing, given that this app used to work great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable. I used to love using Splitwise for tracking trip expenses and splitting with friends, but now I can barely add any expenses due to the app limits. Why pay for premium when Google Sheets is free?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic features are paid now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for limiting daily expenses to 4 in free tier. Shame! Looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good & useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads Very Annoying when you want to record an immediate expense, it constantly pops up with an add Not at all recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit to add expenses in non-pro version is really disheartening. Will uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became greedy - don't take away free tier services"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It added a ten second timer for expenses, and now also has a daily expense limit making it virtually unusable for the free tier. Greedy developers :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so very helpful for keeping track of big group expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1.First of all it is good app for managing expenses. 2.But when I use your app in between you put a limit on recording expenses, and asking for subscription. 3.That result me to take out pen and paper to note down my further expenses. 4. If i have to use pen and paper then why should i use your app?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove Ads. Using it since ages but can't tolerate the ad thing. Basic functionalities should be free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app when traveling with friends. Avoid having to split checks at venues. Also, a must have during overseas using currency conversions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM (will update if this changes) I figured I would pay the $40/year to add >3 transactions to a service I find useful. However, the half-baked features continue with premium. From this app, you CANNOT: - add people to an expense without providing an email address - itemize expenses manually - use an existing photo of a receipt to itemize - create a group so non-premium people can add >3 expenses This jankyness was fine when it was free. It is not for $40."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app.... But now, you even have to pay to add more than 4 expenses? What a total ripoff!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy and efficient way to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it is am amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Раньше было лучшим приложением для разовых подсчетов трат. Теперь, из-за ограничения на количество вносимых трат, пользоваться почти невозможно."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add unlimited expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limitations make the app had to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max of 4 expenses per day before needing to subscribe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never use Splitwise to transfer money, NEVER. They hold onto funds days longer than any bank"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad, they don't allow us to record more than 3 expenses, then this app is useless, I'm uninstalling, we have many alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This is not splitwise made for. 1st it should be free from aid without any charge as by doing so u r just decreasing popularity of this. 2nd there is nothing in this app so far that is to be priced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"What is with the limit on adding expenses!!! I mean, seriously. And the 10 second wait Everytime I need to add a new expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads have become too intrusive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app but limiting to 3 expenses a day makes it fairly useless for most holidays/trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Didn't like the strategy of limiting per day tranx entry. If I see an alternate, I'll switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An amazing app for all group budgeting needs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not displayed properly data"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting expenses per day is an awful new feature and ruins a great free app. Very poor way to force people to pay for premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three expenses per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they have totally screwed up the app by limiting the expenses you can add and making you wait to add an expense. it used to be very useful, now it sucks and some other app will do the same for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It just to be great but then they got greedy and made it so you had to pay to add more than 3 transactions a day. Venmo has the same feature now so I recommend switching over. Not as good but it's free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed with restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the free app limits the nuber of expences per days and opens annoying adds that cant be clised for 10 seconds every expence! 😢"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, now they force you into pro version.. do not recommend unless you are willing to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use. great way to keep track of expenses. wish it connected to venmo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for expense management in groups and individuals. Also, has lot of good features to visualise expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes separated parents shared expenses tracking and balances easier to keep on top of."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now it's all trash and full of bugs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to manage holiday costs with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's become nagware, asking you to pay for anything. Even things that were free before. Just never start using it or find an alternative asap (it's what I'll do)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transactions a day? Are you joking me?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be useful, but now the limit on how many items one can add per day in the free version renders it useless. The whole point is to add everything individually on the go. There should be a pricing option to subscribe to pro per week which would make it useful for managing holidays expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically useless without paying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Subscription model doesn't make sense. With Ads they would have made great business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a genius little app perfect for trips away with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now unusable. Don't download, use a better competitor app instead!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to love it, but now i have reached my limit after adding in 2 transaction. It feels bad and will not consider to pay the premium for the insincerity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"most disgusting update ever, immediately uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage app after the new update. Forced to pay a yearly subscription is a joke. App deleted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app for managing transactions between groups of people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit ? From when ? Too commercial"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can you Guys please add card payment option just like Beem it. Bet none of the other app will be able to compete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this for several years but have been forced to jump to a competitor because of the ridiculous daily restrictions of entries. I'm fine with paying a premium for advanced features like csv export or analysis tools but good luck trying to charge people a premium for what is essentially the core functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid version killed the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add unlimited expense which is quite disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app. Now they have become greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please people, stop buying pro. Don't encourage these greedy, money-grubbing, app-ruining decisions. What even is the point when there are tons of other apps that do the exact same thing for free. ""3 expenses per day"" has to be the most ridiculous and infuriating thing I have ever read. Bye splitwise, good riddance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"such a pathetic upgrade(?) cannot even add more than 2-3 transactions in a day. utterly useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to love it. But just went to go use it for the first time in a while and have found there is a limit on the number of expenses you can add each day. I dislike it when companies give you the choice between free and a pro account but then make it so uncomfortable they just force you into subscribing. I get they need to make money, but honestly this isn't a necessary service I can do it on excel and I already pay far too many subscriptions. I'd watch an advert to keep using it but won't pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How can these lot charge so much for a tool that accomplishes what a simple spreadsheet can? Try using the xpenshare Web app. The mobile app is coming soon along with new features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I’ve used Splitwise since 2012 and recommended it widely, but recent changes have made the free version frustrating. Now, you can only add 1-3 transactions daily unless you upgrade. There’s also a 10-second wait to add expenses. If pushing for paid plans, consider dropping the free version or making it more user-friendly. Current restrictions are too harsh."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version has now a limited number of expenses per day.. completely useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for updating expenses when especially group went for tour and spend amounts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Goodbye! You yourself degraded your model by adding a subscription model for the app's primary use itself.  There are many free apps and even open-sourced alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"$4.99 per month ...good bye Splitwise. The new ""Free Tier"" option requirements are not acceptable. Long time light usage user, occasional trips with friends was convenient. I referred many friends to this app, but no more, there are many alternatives including pen and paper or a shared spreadsheet. $40 per year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was OK. I have a tolerance for apps dying trying to monetize. This app started making you wait 10 secs between expense logs. The problem was.. it wasn't even paid ads. It was just the app itself asking you to upgrade to the paid version. Useless & annoying for no reason except to be useless & annoying. Finally, it limited the number of interactions to 3 per day. What!?!?! I guess the model is to collect $ on the basic app until an alternative is found, then wither and die into obscurity 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free tier is unusable due to the daily input limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was cool until they started putting 10 second ads after 2 transactions. And only allow you to put 4 in/ day before it max out. That's a bit ridiculous. I'm waiting for someone to make an improved app and this one to become obsolete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Formerly good app destroyed by enshittification."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Before they were not famous it was awesome app . Now , they kept 3 expenses per day to user ..i have add like 10 15 expensive per day with wife n frmds . i have no issue buying app but uts prices subscrtion is to much expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great App! I would have given 5 stars if direct payment option was available. Other than everything is fabulous 🤩"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new expense limitation is awful and make the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ads every time you want to add an expense...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved splitwise so much, been using it for years. But the recent updates to limit the number of purchases you can enter is infuriating. It makes it essentially useless on trips where there are a lot of expenses per day. I will be looking into just using a Google spreadsheet for tracking going forward"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best tracker!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. easy to use. great to keep track of expense between share housemates and travel buddies."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with premium features, legit never going to use again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Pretty good way to manage the many small costs of life, useful for sharehouse or friends groups to keep track of who owes what and does the job of adding and subtracting all other transactions within the same group. Solid app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst app ever. first these friends pay for you and on top of that they shamelessly ask the money back through this app. zero stars imo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"it was good until they introduced a limit in the number of payments you can add in your group to invite you to pay xD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The most basic feature of adding transactios to a group has been made unavailable because the makers are getting a bit too greedy. Premium feature is too expensive for what it offers. Most people just use splitwise as a basic calculator to split purchases. This can also be done with some effort on a simple phone calculator. Hence it doesn't make sense to pay so much for premium version. And now i cannot even add more than 5-6 transactions in a day. This is really weirs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense tracking app but can only add limited number of expenses every day, wow I'm saving a lot of money now 😅. Thanks to this counter intuitive feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a good app, they've monetized basic features and now there are better alternatives available so don't give them any money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads are becoming more and more obnoxious and locking expenses behind a pay wall just makes the whole app worthless. Used to be good but now ruined - skip this app and use a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding limit to the number of expenses have not left us an option to switch to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice Easy to use I wish premium is much cheaper"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have only one question. Why should I spend 999 INR yearly in pro subscription for seeing charts? Do we even need charts?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app few times to split travel expanses with my partner or for household with roommates. It is limited, but gives the basic functionality which makes it recommended. Now the free account is basically irrelevant, not just adds which I understand, but also a limit for only 4 actions a day... Very disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app until they updated and limited the daily transactions. I am ok with supporting devs through 10 second ads, but limiting the transactions to 3 per day just makes the app unusable. Will have to uninstall, sadly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love the simplicity of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and convenient for travel. If you have a big group or 3 or more this will make things simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The paywall is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bad after introducing pro features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Getting too greedy, even with the transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app got botched by forcing users to subscribe for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was great! Ads made it bad and recurring charges made it the worst. There should have been atleast a one time payment option. It was the worst decision ever to make it as a subscription service. Sad to let this app go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupidest pricing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good to maintain financial transaction between friends. But the capping of not more than 5 entries per day makes it worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is how you guys ruin you app, ads were ok, but transaction limit per day wow guys wow, what a business model to lose your users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a very useful app, but now in their greed they've put basic features behind ads and a paywall forcing you to wait for 10 secs to add an expense and beyond a few a day they don't even let you add the expenses. Basically down to useless without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"a really good app to organize a trip with friends or if you live with someone and want to have the expenses well organized"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fab App that makes group hangs hassle-free, especially with some ""friends"" who conveniently forget to pay up...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 2 expenses per day. Moving to another split bill app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app till they came up with greedy ways of getting u to buy premium. Subscription model is pointless for this app, one time payment wouldve made more sense. Another great app spoiled by greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 entries a day. 10 seconds ads. Got fed up with this app. Someone, please recommend any good app for expense management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great app!!! But how it has limited the access to only 4 expenses a day! And the price for premium is insane!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic app function is restricted because of ad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I suppose someone runned the numbers and concluded that turning the app unusable for the free tier would be more profitable. What amazes me the most is the subscription, which is completely disproportionate. Considering there are free alternatives, I see no future for this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"product for monthly subscription . nonsense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate splitwise. I've used tricount, but using splitwise on a trip with others who use it. Splitwise is not obvious how to put in an expense someone else paid, limits you to 4 transactions a day (unless you pay a subscription of $5 every month) and other annoyances. Tricount is much easier to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really? Pro subscription? Just show me a couple ads and get on with it. I don't need a monthly expense for something my notes app and a calculator can do in a marginally longer time. No point getting it if you plan to add more than 3 expenses in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super helpful and fluid app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"superb app. really like it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be great but they've made the free version unusable by limiting the amount of transactions per day to a stupid low amount and giving ads all the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've just randomly decided to put an add whenever you create a new expense, telling you that the ""pro"" version is free of it. Not only that, but you are now limited by a daily limit of expense you can create with the free version. I might just go back to using ms excel at this point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting users to add more than 3 expense per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unlimited expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm limited per day to add expenses. If you don't want us to use it free than make it completely paid but not free with absolutely nothing you can do when always getting blocked to pay for the app. Still sucks to have limit on 4th of may 2024"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A fixed one time charge justifies pro membership. The app is useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely unuseable. Indundated with ads and limits the number of transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The advertisements and the severely limited number of traction you can add per day in the free version make this app unusable. Look for another option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An important and an essential application to record expenses among people in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very easy and convenient. I do wish there was a way to pay with a credit card."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now they're really trying to push pro down our throats meaning no one wants to use it anymore. Will transfer to another service as soon as I can."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"putting ad is ok for earning, but Why allow only limited expense addition, Worst decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started to charge what used to be free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used Splitwise for a very long time, but now rhey made the pro version almost mandatory, as the free version is just for namesake, allowing to add only 4-5 expenses per day, that too with ads before adding each expense. That's a disaster, and all the recent reviews reflect that. Splitwise has gone from best to worst. RIP Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get it money is nice but there is no reason for this app to be a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushes pro a lot. Not very functional if you do not pay for pro version. Will uninstall after this trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"149 per month subscription. What a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is a huge payment to subscribe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since they have restricted adding expenses for free users, I have abandoned this app. It used to be my go to split expenses app but what a shame that the greedy management decided to ruin this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 daily expenses is not realistic. Practically, this is not a free app any more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The paid version has receipt scanning but there is no way to add discounts in the itemized version and then I can't add the note if the total doesn't match the items. Completely useless and waste of money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do you really think asking money for adding expense is good. Same on you. You could have added some new features in pro version but instead of you asked money for adding expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"superb"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a fan anymore after they introduced ads and daily limits!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a very useful and good app, until they decided to limit the functions and make it hard to use.. i mean, 3 transactions a day?? Might as well just make it a paid app from the start. Deleted this app immediately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You are limited to how many expenses you can add per day ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limitations are making me look for another app. Found another app that is actually usable without having to pay an exorbitant yearly fee. Real shame, because it's a great app otherwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a subscription based model and locking features behind it such as currency conversions makes sense. Limiting the number of expenses a person can keep track of doesn't, and defeats the purpose of this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best way to keep track of expenses with our family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy, useful, not bothering with random ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had to change my review. It's become riddle with ads and limits number of transactions a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful application for trips get together etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pls remove per day transaction limit since we need to mandatorily see ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great software 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is too slow. Transactions are not interfacing. Limiting to 4 transactions per day is next worst update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can somebody suggest alternative for this app?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A day 3 times, no even have experience then uninstall on next"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. Can't link venmo, doesn't track PayPal payments and is holding my money in their awful pay system that I refuse to sign up for. Beyond their terrible cross platform integration, they failed to create a basic HMI... This appears to be the Theranos™ of payment apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Borderline unuseable due to horrible monetization. I switched to using google sheets instead. It's almost all the same functionality and free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No proper translation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Entries per day is extremely limited :D horrible app, do not use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very easy to keep accounts with friends and family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update forces a 10 second ad before adding each expense. Do not update!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to split expenses. Very much accurate. Recommended to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you have to pay lmao"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ashore want us to get the paid version so made only 4 entries available per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Per day transaction limit is not good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Long time user of this app and noticing it consistently gets worse, bogged down by ads, wait times to enter data, linkage issues to Venmo and promotion of their own Splitwise Pay, etc. I've had a couple of issues recording cash payment and it not posting, causing confusion. Liked the app for many years, but at this rate, if Venmo figures out a better shared payments system, I may switch away. This app is getting quite annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's pretty good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Number of expenses per day are limited apparently. You deserve this 1 star for putting a paywall on the most basic feature of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like it better when it was free and had fewer pushes to move to premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After a recent update, each person can add up to three expenses per day. This made the app more difficult to use. I'll find an alternative for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for trips with friends to keep track of who pays for what."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Activities under different groups shows at same place, it would be better if shown separately"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Enshitfication because of paywall, not good app. Uninstalling ... Pity, used to be a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The main purpose of the app is to add an expense and split it. If that can not be done in free and it bugs you to wait 10 seconds then what is the purpose of being a free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ghatiya app hai settle nhi ho rha payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app for tracking expenses when working or traveling in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now fully monetising it with only 4 entries per day allowed unless pay for pro. Will delete after this holiday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the free daily expenses to 3 is pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unreasonable rate. Putting limit on adding expense is a decision you will regret"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"low class application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No better way to keep track of group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"very complicated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved it, now they push Pro and make you watch a 10sec ad & only permit you to add 3 expenses per day. Horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be my go-to app for managing expenses with friends, but recent updates have made it less enjoyable to use. The introduction of charges and ads has taken away from the simplicity and convenience that originally drew me to the app. While I understand the need for revenue, it feels like a step backward in terms of user experience. I hope the developers reconsider their approach and find a better balance between monetization and user satisfaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app works fine, but it's way too large for what it does. The free version has declined, and paying a monthly fee for the basic calculations the app provides is not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to skip a 10s wait to add an expense? So many other apps out there, thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app forces you to buy pro version by putting in ads and limitation to expenses that can be added. No logic to adding limit to such a thing. Strongly not recommended. Many other free apps abailable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Accurate and keeps tabs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I get wanting to monetize the app, but breaking the venmo integration isn't cool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its very annoying to see ad to upgrade every time I add expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Update: it's not something I need because I don't go on group holidays usually, but sounds like pro version had what I needed when I did go on a group hol. Also, it's easier than using a calculator and messaging everyone so changed to 5*. Initial: It needs a currency converter! Once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier to use. Probably not ideal if you want paying back each day but if you've got the resources to wait for the end of the holiday it makes sense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"4 stars only because of the subscription model for the pro version. Would gladly pay a one time fee to own the app, though."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"An app with the target audience of people that can't afford their own accountant. The same people that won't be paying $39.99 a year or $4.99 a month for even the most extra of features. If anything I could justify a small one-time payment, but I wouldn't even pay $0.50 a month for this service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app to track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without pro version This app is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using for more than 5 years. All of the sudden they make you watch adds and limit your daily transactions. Will not be using again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely limited adding of expenses. I used to be able to do a lot with the free version but now it asks me to watch an ad every time i enter an expense and now they even limit the number of times you can add expenses. Such a shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a great app.now they are made it as a business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy app to get use to using right out of the gate. The basic level has most everything you need for a variety of activities or trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. simple, and works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Solid app, but the 4 expenses per day limit make it unusable in the free tier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They introduced a stupid timer. Now I lose my time each time using this app. I hate this app. I will look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Il fatto che puoi fare solo 4 inserimento al giorno è ridicolo. Piuttosto fatela subito pagare. Cercherò un'alternativa"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bring advertisement based model...you apps doesn't comes under daily usage category.. people use it while doing trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to have a real free tier but not anymore! You will not be allowed to do any actions after registering some expenses. Greedy maneuver from the company. I recommend any another alternative to this useless app. Took me 13.4 seconds to find something way better on Google/PlayStore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't believe how frustrating it is with this per day transaction limit! Uninstalling the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app! The premium feature also has a receipt scanning feature. Would have been better if it could also let me add users on individual items that was itemized using the scan."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization killed app. Been using this app for years since its launch. The constant push for pro upgrade gets annoying quick. Would be more willing to pay for a pro version of the app once but not on subscription model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't begin describe how annoying the limits on this free version is. The pro version is *just* expensive enough to make it not worth it to switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically unusable since nearly everything is behind a paywall now. Better use Tricount instead! :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"no need for this app to be paid, I can develop its clone for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to recommend Splitwise because of how easy it was to track group expenditure, however the free option is too restrictive (only 3 expenses a day). It was a great app but I don't use it enough to pay for subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"such a brilliant app 😃"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 txn a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app to split costs! Amazing for holidays and just in general when going out with friends and family!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"RIP Splitwise free tier. App is unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has got worst after the upgrade!! Less than 3 transactions a day is a joke for free version... Was a big fan of the app but not any more! Thumb's down! Switching to other app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very Good and Helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paying to be frustrated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like others have said, the app is now useless at the free tier and the cost is too high to justify. Going to dump the app and try a different one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version only let you record 3 transaction a day which gets really annoying. Will need to switch platform"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Company got desperate for premium subscribers and screwed up the UI for the rest. Super irritating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer connecting with Venmo, says that it's not compatible with the most current Venmo version 10.39.1 - the pay with Venmo option helps to split monthly bills amongst the household. Will change my review back to 5 stars once this is fixed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Indispensable when traveling with a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No Costomer Support to call. When you have problems you can only email from the Support link."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a descent app before they blocked everything, make you wait, set limited expenses trying to make you pay for the full version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I don't like how the premium is now unavoidable, because of dark patterns enforced on users on features that used to be free. I think it's fair from them to expect me to contribute, but come on €30/year for an app that does some basic math?! And make me pay a fair price from the very beginning, don't ask me to pay for smt that used to be free, that's such a terrible biz model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm using this app for years. Now we need to pay to add expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is forcing me to again nd again to for pro licence. Totally disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used Splitwise for a very long time, but now they made the pro version almost mandatory, as the free version is just for namesake, allowing to add only 4-5 expenses per day, that too with ads before adding each expense. Splitwise - YOU SUCK. time to switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires so much additional info. It dosent even work. Why do I need to add email address and phone numbers????"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A good app in principle, but its monetization model is overblown. After a certain amount of expenses added, you are expected to pay €40 a year to keep using the app (the alternative is waiting an entire day). That's too much to deal with a minor inconvenience. I'd be willing to pay that amount once, or less than half that a year, but certianly not €40 every year. I'd rather organize my expenses the old fashioned way or use one of the many alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent way to keep track of shared costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying not to leave comments on the Internet, but I need to. It was really good app, useful, had a great amount of users. But seems that the same thing happened here, as with many other good apps, some ""great"" management came I believe, cause it was bought by someone else and decided to kill the app with idiotic decisions making it completely unusable. Congratulations of failing and killing very good work of the devs! Leaving, not coming back and spreading the word of how bad it is 👌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm using Splitwise for several years and always been satisfied with it. Recently it was no longer possible to enter multiple expenses a day. I understand that it does not has to be free but the pricing and what you get for it is not balanced. Just for entering more than 4 expenses a day and some graphs that tell nothing it's not worth of the price. I advice a ligth account for 1€ a month for an in between account.. I will not continue my premium membership and will look for a cheaper service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restrictions for free usage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is essentially useless. Limits number of expenses a day and shows an ads between each transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate this app and I don't want people to be able to send me money through splitwise pay but you can't cancel if you enable it. At least they haven't explained how in their documentation (because they don't want you to cancel it)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate using this app now for being too limited with adding expenses per day. Pro version is not affordable. Will uninstall this app soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good, very, very restrictive to force you to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 4 items a day without paying $5 per month? What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Keeps my mind clear. Love it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"""You've reached the maximum numbee of expenses for today, but Splitwise pro"". Gargle my nuts splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, they paywalled adding more than 3 expenses per day... I am currently using this app to split most of my expenses. This includes my mortgage with my partners. I just came back from vacation hoping to add over 70 expenses to the app and now if I dont want to pay, it will take 24 days to complete this work... I have no problem paying for a good app, but a subscription, not sustainable. If storage is a problem, at least add the option to use our google storage or something."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app by introduction of terrible payment model .Won't use again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For everything you need to pay, was great not it is not."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed, the app used to work very well, now you have to wait 10s before you can even do anything? They are pushing the pro so hard it's ridiculous. EDIT: Apparently you cannot add more than 3 expenses per day AT ALL, now that's just insane."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is perfect when traveling as a group!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another example of Greed ruining nice things. Started out as a great app, but really lost all respect and integrity since they started pushing the ""get premium"" narrative with limited daily expenses, timers to wait until one can add another expense, and all the other removed free features that used to make the app great. I truly hope your shareholders and board of directors hit their pinkies on a daily basis from now on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"P.S. Bunnies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why cant we update expenses more than 3 times on free version ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"From being a brilliant app to be absolutely greedy and limiting free users as much as possible to go for that pro version. Considered getting it but way too expensive for an app that does simple maths"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst limit update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Maximum expenses reached for the day?? This app has gone from the go to, to the totally usless list. Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use for girls trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is basically useless now. Subscription too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app limits the number of expenses per day, making it useless without paying a monthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not great since you can only add 3 expenses a day now. Other things are better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From awesome to trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have been using this application for years, mainly for holidays, but it's been a while and I am discovering there is now a limit to 4 entries on expenses. It is ridiculous. How are you supposed to you use it when you are on holidays? When you start to limit the basic concept of your application, it shows there is a problem, and that doesn't appeal to get the premium version. That will be the last time I am using it. Shame it was a good one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pay to use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My ex and I use this app to keep track of the kids' expenses. We use Venmo, and it was great. Recently, though, I can't seem to be able to pay her using Venmo. It's kind of annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was good untill they decided to make money but keeping too many restrictions in place."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"its the best app for trip or something like that with many people.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now still good but only with a pro account for everybody"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sirve, pero es muy limitado el uso"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version has become unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from being the best app to split money between friends to possibly the worst app because of the premium feature lock. I wouldn't mind paying for the premium, but the way the devs have pushed this update. Thumbs down."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cobrar por subir gastos? En serio??? Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed to a pay service for most features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible new update forcing you to use a monthly subscription for basic features of inputting expenses. Used to use this all the time, but will be deleting it now and finding another option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Why does venmo integration no longer work? Edited: developer responded. Changed from 2 to 3 stars. Will update score accordingly once problem is fixed. Thanks for the info devs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Edit: Thanks for the workaround. Issue: Isn't working with venmo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app used to be great, but it's useless without a subscription now, won't accept more than 4 items added per day. The charm of this app was that it didn't do too much - it's not worth the price of an AAA video game every year!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why I need to pay for simple calculator 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow...changed my life...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is great but now its paid, and its the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App is good and easy to use comparatively. Still it is not worth paying for for the facilities it provide. Charts is not at all helpful as a premium feature. I would like to see some basic information like total expense done for single member of the group. Or total expenses happened for the whole group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They say Rome didn't fall overnight, but splitwise proves that it can be done, in perfection"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App - easy to use, does it's function - no annoying ads - clean and simple user interface - highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Love the app. Some suggestions for future improvements: 1) Calculator when key-in amount 2) Add owner's payment details in profile Edit: limit on no. of transactions per day, no ads but need to pay to proceed, or wait next day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only lets you add like 4 entries a day for free... Absolutely ridiculous. Especially if you weren't using the app the day of."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Poor app , abnormal working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is such a money grab. And you can't import more than like 4 receipts per day. Trash. Burn it to the ground."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why I have to pay premium.... Just run ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy developers ruined a perfectly good app. £4 a month just to keep tabs of bills. What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app seems to have completed its journey from the best and most used app to the worst and least used app. It is so annoying that one has to pay 30 Euros/year for maintaining simple calculations that can even be done on a spreadsheet shared in Google drive. Not going to use this app anymore and moving away to a different one as there are plenty of similar apps available at the Google Play Store with great user reviews. RIP Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible UX after the introduction of per day limits and wait period before adding expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version sucks. It used to be good but now they only allow you to out in 3 expenses a day and wait between every expense. 100 percent a waste of your time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for keeping tabs on who owes what on group vacations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is now essentially unusable. The ads are annoying, but I could deal with them if I had to. Now, you can only add a few expenses per day for free. The pro version is not at all reasonably priced, especially since the only pro function I would use is to add more expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free. Now it limits amount of transactions. Will be finding another service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app.. but with the new changes with ads and limited expenses that can be added per day, it is time to go to a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New daily limit and time limit before inputting expenses all make this app more an annoyance than helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update limits how many entries to 4 a day and you have to wait 10 seconds between entries. It basically makes the app useless to me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Assumes your venmo email is the same as your splitwise email and then doesn't let you change it, so your friends will be sending money to venmo accounts which don't exist."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application for friends, easy to use, very intuitive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So simple to use and made our holiday spending easy to track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Big thumbs down for transaction limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App needs to find better ways to monitoze. Limiting transactions per day is not the way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was once a great app but is filled with ridiculous paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am trying to create group but not able to and if add people it's not showing any group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Suddenly can't pay using venmo. Says to check my app store for an update. Finally today saw an update available, updated venmo. Still doesn't work. Splitwise just says ""update to a newer version of venmo"" BUT THERE ISNT ONE."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved it until the free tier only allowed up to 3 expenses a day..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app continues to get worse with each update ever since the company decided to push most features behind an overpriced paywall. Now to make things worse the company has decided to make the app even more annoying for free users by adding a timer that prevents you from adding expenses until the timer is up. What's next I have to watch an ad before adding an expense???? This company is probably going to go under and lose all of their users if they keep up the terrible decisions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shouldn't be restricting users to add the daily expenses. Forcing to buy premium version is not good.. at least main functionality of the app should be available to all the users or else no point in running the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entry/day limit and 10s between entries unless subscribed to the pro version. Would pay upfront for a pro version but definitely not a subscription. Download something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really easy to use and excellent way to manage expenses with a group of friends. Genius"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a great app, but now it wants you to pay a monthly charge to log more than a certain amount of expenses per day and will have a 10 sec delay during most logging (unpaid version). When traveling, it's very difficult to keep up with shared expenses and this apps whole purpose was to aid in that process. Hoping they restore the apps functionality soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asks for money at each and every step"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too greedy an app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage app that used to be good but now unusable due to daily limits on expenses and the requirement to watch an ad every time you want to add an expense. Full garbage, looking forward to deleting it and not looking back"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Free version of the app seems to be a perfect way to keep track of who has spent what and who owes who what on a group trip of even a night out. And it's even better when you select the simplify payments button! Used twice with group holidays of 5 or 6 people and this makes it so easy to settle up at the end"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now: 10 seconds delay and very few expenses per day. An app to be completely deleted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro ads after every expense, and only 4 expenses per day, make it extremely irritating to do anything. Maybe ok for one-off expenses, but for tracking over, say, a trip, it's terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free tier is almost unusable at this point. Stay away if you tend to pick a specific day to tackle your bills. If you already invested in the app you can now add splitwise to the list of other mobile games that make you log in every day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and I hate how they have limited the free version. On top the pro is very expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 3 entries per day allowed for free version.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good, now runing for money,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome for expense sharing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was my go to to settle up expenses at the end of every month with my significant other... now that this has turned into a subscription model limiting to 3 transactions per day, this app is useless to me. Subscription models for apps are the bane of my existence. I'll be uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app unless you pay. Can't pay because I don't live in the country that the app thinks I live in"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Insane and disgusting monetisation push from the app that ruins basic usability and customer experience and forces to wait and watch adds for absolutely no reason"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years with friends. The new update ruined everything now you are limited in number of expenses as a free user, enshittification sends its regards."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit on the number of transactions that one can add without a subscription is too small and hence using this app now is almost impossible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the magic that saves me so much time and money hassle."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy app, suddenly started limiting number of daily expenses to add on the free app. Without any prior notice. Quite frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: unfortunately I'm yet another unhappy user. Been using it for at least 8 years and the app does what it is supposed to do very well. The issue here is about how aggressive the pay walls were set up recently. There is a 10 second ad for every expense added and still you get blocked after adding 4 in a day. No option for a one-time payment. Considering what the app delivers, the subscription is quite expensive. I refuse to pay that much for every user in my house. It doesn't make any sense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Super annoying to get ads for every single expense added. There's a new app called Settle Up! It's free and looks like they don't have stupid pay gates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super usefull app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be good. But it isn't now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app really works great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses per day AND advertisement between adding expenses - do you want people stop using the app? Because I am deleting it now..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expenses aren't splitting correctly and the status/balance are not showing the correct values."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What pro chee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Due to new changes it is not longer. Use tricount now days"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app long back its great app.. but now i have re install and now Its Worst!! just 4 expenses can be added with out subscription..... Too much ... So want to unistall and installing alternate app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is unusable currently (long wait times, max of only 3 expenses per day)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't add more than 4 expenses in a group. That is insane - defeats the purpose of app. It use to be great 2-3 years ago. But this pro concept & applying unnecessary restrictions are horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limitation is very annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a decent enough app for tracking shared expenses, but they've started hamfisting in their exorbitantly priced pro tier, and severely limiting free tier functionality for what is basically a glorified spreadsheet. So I made myself a spreadsheet and have started using it instead, and id recommend anyone else considering using splitwise do the same."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app to split expenses on any trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app! used for a trip to japan and everything went smooth between 8 people. can get a bit convuted at the end if you use multiple currencies and dont have the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for our future"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for groups traveling together. I especially like it because if two members (or more) go off on their own expenses can be split between them and not involve the other members of the group. Great job developer!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to vouch fo this app. Not any more. Really? Pay for adding more expenses? Developers have lost their mind ? Or are they scrapping the bottom of the pot for $? i hope,and i know it will happen, that a different app comes into power and takes over"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"To settle the expense user have to go to another payment app. That is a limitation i see for this app. But the ability to split the expenses based on %, shares etc is great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is great ..cost is not"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst from April 2024. Full paid to use. And lots of bugs in displaying balance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment options no longer work with newest version of venmo (10.38.0)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish only 3 expense per person pointless used it a lot in the past will delete app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful and easy to use app when it comes to organizing and calculating vacation/trips expenses with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app to me. However with recent updates, it becomes useless and being ridiculous with limited transations recorded and continous ads promoted. I knew it should have some fees, but the way team pushed users for payment was being nonsense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is paid now, so better switch to other apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously very very disappointed with them restrictions on the app. It was all fine until it was just having to sit through ads, but a complete prevention from using basic provisions on the app if just too much. A complete let down of all the users who have faithfully contributed to your data collection since decades."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No record for monthly and weekly expenses report ..need to improve"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"30 euros a year to register some expenses is too high in my personal opinion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app to split payments with friends to avoid any calculations. Rated 4 stars because I don't feel a pro version is worth the monthly/yearly subscription, a fixed fee for the app would be much more appealing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bloquear a 4 movimientos por día, la funcionalidad básica de la aplicación, hace que resulte bastante inútil"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to two items per day?! Are you kidding?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app for a number of years. Now it's unusable unless you pay for it. Not worth it anymore. A quick search online with point towards other free apps where yoo can Splid your bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"now no UPI attached with this app, earlier it was easy to settle payments as splitwise tied up with Paytm."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing users to buy the subscription plan. It was a great app before all the new limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for almost 10 years now. Absolutely no glitches and the ease of use is top notch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be amazing for post travel settling. Now you can only enter 4 entries a day without having to pay for Pro. Absolutely trash and a total cash grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a great app, but unfortunately their per day transaction limit for free users has ruined the app. I had been using the app for about last 5 years, but now I am looking for an alternative, They could have just added ads instead of limiting basic functionality to force users to buy premium subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"life is easy with this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad change the split 😡😡😡😡😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates have greatly reduced features for free tier users in an attempt to coerce users to sign up for pro subscription. Delays and ads between adding expenses and now even a limit to the number of expenses that can be added in a day. I will be migrating shortly, app has become unusable. (Note: my previous review was 5/5, but updates greatly reduced usability)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit on 17th Apr 2024 from 5 to 1. What stupidity this is... Completely understand any business needs funds to function. But this is beyond stupidity where you cannot allow to add more than 3 expenses in a day. It kills the complete usability of app. Been an occasional user of Splitwise, specially when going on trips, since past 6yrs but now this is utter garbage. We don't mind watching ads, but putting a limit on how you use this app is definitely going bring your users down."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now that they want you to sign up for a paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ye app pehle sahi thi, par ab 4 entries k baad paise maangti hai premium buy karne k liye. Recommendation is that only download this app if your entries are equal to or less than 4."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of transactions that can be noted to 5 for a day is totally uncalled for. Pop up for premium purchase are regular while inserting transactions, moreover these pop ups can't be closed before 5-10 secs. Have seen using this app for last 6-7 years but the recent changes have forced me to move to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We have used splitwise earlier and was great. Not knowing the update and transaction limitations we have messed up our trips transactions...it's painful to reconcile the calculations... coming from product background I would ensure to retain the customer base and charge a nominal platform fee for unlimited transaction entry. Unfortunately this would be the last time I use splitwise. Tried to pay for pro it's throwing an error for all payment modes cards or upi ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I will never pay that much for a subscription model for something that is just slightly more convenient than excel or.. a calculator. What do you think you are?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was very good for splitwise but last 10 days total balances are clumsy. I am unable to find how much I want to receive & pay . Try to fix this problem"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless without subscribing to pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without a pro version. Also what charges they are asking is not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app does not integrate with Venmo. I have the latest version of both apps and Splitwise refuses to integrate with Venmo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it works"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to love the app but increasingly it's becoming unusable as a free member with a low cap on how many expenses you can add and forcing you to wait 10 seconds before being able to add one. To the developers: please make premium features that encourage me instead of making your app a horrible experience to use. Much more of these annoying paywalls and I will unfortunately be deleting the app rather than becoming a premium member."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful stable app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Corporate greed has taken over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Take the hint guys. The monetization strategy is not working. Stop charging us for adding expenses and figure out some other way to earn. I've been using Splitwise since more than a decade and I've never had such a strong reason to find any alternate app. Most of the disappointed reviewers say exactly the same thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Free tier shrinked over time. It still usable but you can hit the limits easily now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sends to non-existent venmo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love it! helps keeping finance clear!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app became unusable without pro subscription, which is way too expensive for occasional use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You could have increased number of advertisement, but putting limit on no. of expenses...not so cool.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent eazy to use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on adding transaction hurts more than anything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Awesome App. But It will become a more convenient if we could Add expense according to the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very user friendly app.Highly recommended for group expense management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good.But expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible set of people asking to get pro without notice only for to enter 2 expenses per day if you don't have premium subscription. Better find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and convenient program"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently introduced multiple annoyances for free users, which can only be removed by paying. These annoyances include waiting 10 seconds between expenses and limiting the number of expenses to only 3 per day. Not cool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until they added a paywall and limited you to only be allowed to add 3 expenses per day. Totally ruined the utility for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Loved Splitwise for years, now they make you wait 10 seconds before adding expenses, I get maybe having ads throughout the app, but wasting people's time is another thing, especially when the app is basically for saving time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ad while adding an expense? You gotta be kidding me. It's not a rocket science of an app to make. Knowing that there are tons of alternatives available, this is a dumb move to pull. You can't play with basic functions like that. It was a nice journey till now but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is not for free anymore. It costs to add more than 2 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New free tier is impossible to use with 10 expenses per day as limit. Waiting 10 seconds to enter an expense, daaamn. They forgot about the customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I got this in order to quickly calculate the most efficient way to settle up in a group. But it does not calculate logically and net off to the fewest payments possible. In a recent group of 3, it had me pay person A and person B, and also had B pay A. Why not deduct person B's debt to person A from my debt to person B, and have me pay everything to A? That's what I wanted, and this app doesn't do it, so could be more efficient. Also only 4 transactions per day possible with the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I loved the app because it really saves human efforts for splitting bills among people. It helped me a lot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most of the basic features are now behind the paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless pay to use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"U need to use pro, otherwise expenses cannot be added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on daily expenses renders app virtually useless unless you consistently add expenses as you go along. Such a shame as the app was great before these changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new monetization options suck. I understand the company wants to make money with subscriptions, but the new limitations negatively affect the user experience by a high degree. Give us an option to see an ad instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Some time amount add karne ma galti Kar deta ha"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ya'll just had to go ahead and ruin the app...sorry but we can't pay or suscribe to everything. It's a shame...the app was very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Needs to upgrade to Pro after the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They killed the free version..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total a pathetic application. Thinks can be done in simple way, but this application all the unnecessary things in it. WASTE"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app . Pushing for pro version with everystep now ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now with the limits per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"By far the best app for expense tracking. Been paying for Pro for years even though I did not need the free features, just because I think good developers deserve to be paid. People complaining about free tier restrictions should try working for free! 30 euro / year is nothing compared to the time and stress this app saves. I use it to manage everything from household expenses, to going out with friends, to holidays. The flexibility and ease of use is simply best in class."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very sad.. it's not free .. it's chargeable .. free app has so much of restrictions that you will need to take the pro .. else, just five entries and there will be ad in every 2 minutes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many adds and paywall is too restrictive. Go with an alternative unless you are expecting to pay immediately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can now only add three expenses per day on the free version. Used to be a great app before this. Use something else. Correction: four expenses per day. However my point stands - I have now moved to a different free app with no limit on input so all good now. Update: we have moved onto splitster which is working great for us on our trip abroad with no limits on how many expenses we can add per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to share costs when traveling with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Totally needful application, easy to use and proper maintenance of spendings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now basically useless for expenses on a trip unless you pay for the pro subscription due to rate limiting. Don't upgrade!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to calculate how to split bills for dinner, trips, household and other things."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App could have been the best in its genre but chose instead to be greedy and introduce premium features. Totally unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is decent but I didn't use much and they are asking took premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous daily expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"nice app to greedy app == 5 stars to 1 star"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to add expenses after reaching limit per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I think they are knowingly making this dumb updates ,cap on how many expense i can add in day??? I can understand 10sec thing but this is next level"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for trips with friends. the premium also allows you to easily convert different currencies, which makes it very easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simple and easy to use. avoids any confusion or fights over money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, fairly useless now with only 3 free transactions. One of the worst monetisation models I've seen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy and accurate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to a be a great app for managing shared expenses however latest version has made this into a ransomware as it adds a delay screen and then only allows four expenses to be added a day. So it's now really become useless. So I guess it's asking to either move on or buy - the later I am not very interested in now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app before they started blocking you from adding expenses on the free version. Too bad, it's a useless app in the free version. Looking at all the other recent reviews, it doesn't look like the management cares"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the recent updates this application has become basically useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great functionality, but ads and feature limiting for free version are getting aggressive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Avoid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I am deducting 1 star because the no. Of expenses per day in the free version is very less i.e 3. It makes us literally merge multiple transactions into just 1 expense on the app which kind of destroys the whole purpose of the app. Please increase the daily limit to 5 instead of 3. It would really help out a lot! Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Very useful app earlier, have been using from a decade, but nowadays they restrict you if you are a free user, they introduced wait time for adding expenses, which is very irritating. Understand the need of business, but it simply killed the purpose of managing expenses without much hassle. Hence, reducing the rating (from 5* earlier). Hope team can restore atleast some of the basic things to improve customer experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Per day limit is pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app..thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for vacationing with friends and splitting multiple activity bills. Can't say enough good things about it. Everyone can keep track of their share of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really nice app to settle the travel expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for almost 8 years. It's unfortunate to see how features in free version are removed gradually. Limiting the number of entries per day worst update. Time to look for an alternative. There are hundreds of better alternatives with better UI and functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very helpful app. As an Android app developer I can say this is a well deserved 5 star app. Edit - paywall at 3 transactions is too much. Does only one person to a group need to be pro or everyone? I'll never have a group where everyone is pro so I might need to find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it WAS great for friends and familyy trips BUT the monetization model is the worst I've seen. Limiting the expenses for free users to 3 is very disappointing. Also its bugged. Reached the maximum expenses yesterday and I cant still add more expenses today."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There seems to be a lot of interesting features and ideas, but wow it's really poorly executed. - Can only add 4 transactions a day before needing to pay for premium - Venmo integration is broken (as of now) - artificial waiting screens when adding expenses?? There's cool ideas like groups, spending metrics, etc., but it's all useless if the core functionality just doesn't work. A spreadsheet is free and does this better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience with this app, not able to understand where the money is going and from whom I need to take."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Been a happy user for more than five years. Liked the option of keeping the finance out of your friendship 😜. Recent step of limiting no of expenses to 3 per day doesn't seems like a wise move. On top of that 10 sec ad before every expense addition, to remind you of the pro subscription, is like rubbing salt ! We accept business needs money but this is too harsh."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless app allows only 3 enteries per day. why someone needs this for a simple settlement instead of wasting time here better to build our own app with basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very covenient to track shared expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app BUT... I have been a user since the past 6 years and have been very happy so far. However, putting a cap on number of expenses per day is ridiculous - that too a very small number. And no notice for this! They do not care about their customers at all. I suppose it's time to move on to 9ther apps. Really disappointing!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit sucks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unusable app now that expenses are limited. I understand the need to make money, but the core functionality of the app is now gone is the free version. Not worth using unless you pay the $30/year subscription. Oh and they also have ads now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription model completely destroyed this apps usefulness"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay wall with 3 expense limit ruined it. What a shame. Very bad decision. Will stop recommending it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and versatile."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows only 4 expenses to be added per day without subscription and the Subscription Charges are too high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the ""pro"" update this apps doesn't worth anything, even if it's free, it's BAD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great but they decided to completely hamstring the free version. Moved all my money out and deleted. Venmo has an option for splitting money that's good enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads ads ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting how many expenses you can add per day for free versions completly defeats the purpose of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really nice one to manage and analysis the expenses. I suggest to extend the Corporate Service with more features and security. One improvement point would be, on the currency conversion. This is not allowing to come back to the original currency with same Forex. This one can act as demotivating factor. Or else it is 5 star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer usable at the free tier due to the free tier expense limit and not worth $5/month for the pro tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice , saved lot of efforts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They force you to upgrade. This app does not provide the basic functions it should provide for free which it previously did like adding expenses. Disgusting!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Doesn't let you change the currency!! There should be option to change the currency!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor after recent changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having to wait 10 seconds before adding an expense is one thing, but a limit of 5 free expense per day is ridiculous and makes the free tier of this app completely unusable. Will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful on trip or hangout with friend group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app for its simplicity and effectiveness, but recently, it has become nothing short of frustrating. It's failing to perform the most basic task it was designed for. It now constantly pushes for premium purchases just to access essential features. It's disappointing to see such a decline in usability and value."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only able to enter 3 expenses per day in free tier. This change has made things very difficult."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This expense-adding limit per day is totally useless. I'm a developer myself, and I think this business model is just plain stupid!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app a lot before and I didn't use it for two years almost. I remembered I had it and was very unpleasantly surprised by the waiting time and daily limit for free version. Used to be great, not so much anymore. That's not how you do business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely overpriced compared to the functionality delivered by other apps in the same price range."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't purchase pro at all due to technical glitch . And asks for pro to record more than a few payments. Completely unusable app for me at the moment . Worst thing to ever happen to humanity"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited for 4 transactions daily for free plan, with ads for every new transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not recommended for free tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful! highly recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is ad-filled trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The subscription price is outrageous, Imagine charging as expensive as Netflix just for >3 input per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If I create a group of expenses...so how the existing members can remove or delete the charges which I already have paid and created.This is huge disadvantage of this particular app.kindly solve the existing problem for better understanding services in future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise around from 2017, but now that it has limitation to add number expense I think id switch to some other app. Google pay would do it for free and everyone is already there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app untill they started with their ridiculous subscription push scheme. It should be simply a paid app from the start if they are going to go this intrusive route"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now they force users to pay for pro to get the same features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally unusable since the update. I save expense logging for the weekend and do it in batches. I can't do that anymore with the 3 expense per day limit. Been using this app for years and now and unfortunately won't be able to use it again. Save your app and revert to the latest update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lmfao 3 per day now, ads? You aren't special, what a ridiculous way to kill your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app lures people looking for a free app. However, the free version is almost useless due to certain limits. The main problem is transperancy. There is not enough information on the ""about this app"" field in the Play Store. The description in the field doesn't refer to all limitations of the free version. Only after app download and use, the limitations are exposed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app that helps you to keep track and settle funds with your partner and friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really Good option to consider to simplify the transactions!✨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting limit on daily transaction making this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible after the paywall, moving elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous new billing model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sadly adding multiple expenses now requires a paid subscription. 30€ per year is to much for a calculus app. I would be OK to pay 5-10€ once. Many much more complicated apps are less expensive then 10€."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good this app for using"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have made the free version useless! I'm not paying 149 per month to do basic math when there are multiple free apps similar to this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paying for adding the mutual expenses even after waiting for 10seconds ads! Not ideal. I am building my own app, sorry!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic and Worst !! Go for other alternatives ASAP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update April 2024. Allowing 3 entries per day on free version is useless. Uninstalling it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Honestly really useful for recording expenses between friends and even for travel groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed their monitisation policy. Now only max 3 items per day, which is unusable on holidays (the core reason to use it). Changing to an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of expenses per day? That's the pettiest thing ever. Disappointed. Never installing it again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting a limit on a daily transactions is a no go for free version. This basic thing shouldn't have been limited. Uninstalling and finding an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has limited use and it's just a scam for the paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"don't bother using it. You can't use anything at all on free tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was useful in the past, but right now it's too awful , no one will use this app to divide expenses and pay 40 dollars per year.. better right down in my notes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good idea but relies on everyone having the app and doesn't really take into account of people are paying as a couple for things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am a long term splitwise user and i have recomended most of my friends to use it for the expense sharing. Now its asking users to subscribe pro for add every 4th expense per day. Its very rude behavior to the users of it. Why can't the basic addition can be given as free. If any bulk users adding 20 or more expenses a day is ok to have pro and to use other options. But, add expenses limitation forcing me to switch to other apps. Splitwise need to have a serious call on this for the app users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro every time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best ever application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to have transparent split with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable after the recent update charging users $5/mo for adding more than a couple of expenses a day. No heads up given for this change either."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"well managed and very helpful app. Smooth with no bugs encountered yet. love the user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly a premium subscription is needed for the most basic functions. Absolutely appalling! I will return to excel or a pen and paper..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"splitwise pro lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and loved it so much. Would be willing to see more ads or pay a one time fee. But this new subscription garbage is uncalled for. Very disappointed with this decision by the app team. Time to move on to an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using the free version for years and I highly recommend it. Intuitive interface (does NOT pelt you with ads!) and never had a problem with functionality. Keeps shared expenses super easygoing even just for 2 people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes added a daily limit for the free version, which made the app nearly unusable. Their plan is to annoy you enough so you eventually give in and buy the yearly/monthly premium plan. Steer clear!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was great, free version now only lets you add a few expenses per day which makes it much less useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant for holidays with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's trash with the subscription model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Practically unusable as the free version because you are limited to 4 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop asking for money for a simple app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Practical, but paywall is too high and makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now, with the number of expenses limit in a day for thr free plan, it is not comfortable anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience, nowadays too much their own ads, everyone please uninstall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on expense addition not acceptable, uninstall app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed has killed this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App..very easy to split up all expenses equally.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app putting daily transactions limits, look for some other good apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They daily limit and ads are very stupid. Just get us the old splitwise back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a shame that they've sold out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add people unless you provide a phone number or email, and even then, you can't use that person until they create an account. Makes it hard to test the app. Speaking of testing out the app, the response time is horrible. Like others have mentioned they put a delay on new transactions so once you enter it you don't see it in the logs until you wait a few minutes or more. Since I couldn't test it easily I uninstalled it. Seems like it was considered best in class not too long ago."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Didn't realize there was a daily cap now. Kinda useless now and will need an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"a glorified calculator that does not even allow overrides to fix errors and imposes a limit on how much you can enter."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise from almost 8 yrs, it is a good app, however I am giving one star for the unreasonable Subscription fees. It is too high for an user who rarely use this. Rs49 per month or Rs399 per year is more than enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"your new freemium strategy is horrible. reducing the capabilities of the functionalities will kill growth"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new feature of limited entries of expenses is a poor way of dealing with customers. Till then splitwise experience was fine."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing that they have introduced a limit to the number of splits you can enter a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was perfect earlier, now they have started limiting basic functionality for free users. Total of 20 friends stopped using this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If user who use this app had money to buy pro subscription; I don't think they would be splitting the money in the first place. Know your customers first🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once i settled all my pending bills. Im leaving this app. They are now limiting adding records per day, and it does not fit my requirement. Gotta go with google sheets. Ive created more complicated tracking than this. It doesnt make sense to pay premium just to do some basic tracking. This app is no longer a problem solver, its a problem itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. I've been using this with friends on group trips for a year or two now, it's made life so much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The restrictions on the free account are too much now so I'll be looking elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Works well but forced timer on the ads are annoying. App seems to be in a decline. Your monetization approaches are hurting your userbase growth"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Destroyed itself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No text"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on adding expense is insane, that is the most basic function on the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the splitwise app works fine with keeping the data of amount shared."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was good when they didn't have only 4 transctions pre days for non pro users. While I get the need to raise funds for keeping the app functional. Hampering the basic functions to generate revenue is unacceptable. They could have developed new intuitive features like AI integration and smart analysis using AI and kept it for pro users. But the decision made by management is making company look greedy and money hungry. Remember there are 100s of similar apps on playstore itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Sometimes, it calculates perfectly. Sometimes, it shows I have to pay my friend1 but when manually calculated by each split, it wrongly shows the calculation which I have to pay to my friend2 also in friend1's to pay.... having trust issues with this app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not letting user to add their expenses. No need to put that limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Couldn't change monthly bills like electric (which change amts every month) the ads are a pain. I understand they are necessary but have a bottom or top banner ads to avoid having users irritated. I also wasn't even on the app for a full minute before it tried to get me to upgrade to pro. It takes me at least a half hour for me to find out if I even like the app enough... Give me some time before asking me. It just isn't very user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is no point of paying 4 cad a month for a finance managing app because most of your users are students who live in sharing. Whoever decided to add a limit to 3-4 expenses per day will be the reason for the downfall of this amazing app. Now I will look for replacement app asap or build it by myself if needed. Thank you team splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, but the recent updates have only made it worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to remove limit of 4 entry and find a alternate solution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much monetization is not good. I can't do what I used to do before. Becoming useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is not usable anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Really essential to organize the finances with my partner. But limited entries per day, and then you have to upgrade to a monthly subscription model? that's harsh..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for almost 5 years. Now you can't add more than 2 expenses per day for free..I think our group should find replacement for this.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Needs to find alternative ways to monetise it instead of removing the free features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New updates have completely ruined the experience. Can hardly input more that 5 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"REMOVE LIMIT OF ADDING EXPENSES"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app for tracking shared expenses but latest update has made the free tier unusable for normal use. They've added a delay screen when adding expenses and limited the number of expenses you can add in a day. Adding user hostile dark patterns like this makes us even more unlikely to subscribe. Ignoring those issues, the cost of the pro plan is too much for what's offered and there's no way to share a subscription with your group or family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An app that charges money for all the basic work..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super helpful with keeping track of household bills and a great way to avoid the awkward money conversation with housemates! never had an issue with this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes splitting bills very easy :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be okay, but not any more. You are now limited to adding three expenses per day unless you pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Works perfectly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything is good. Just need to add 1 thing provide Scanner also by which we can pay here as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a great app, but the limit on transaction you can add makes it unusable. Too bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente, el app permite llevar cuentas con varias personas o grupos de manera fácil y rápida. Es sencilla de usar y no es pesada."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recently introduced daily limit for adding expenses is ridiculous and I'll be leaving the app as a result. Three transactions per day is ridiculous. See you later folks. I'll be moving to any of literally dozens of free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and accurate calculations application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using Spliwise for years, until they block the free users with a daily limit. Should have kept how it was. I'm searching for a alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for irritating ads and only 5 entries per day in free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best and most functional apps in my mobile"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy, greedy app. Hopefully will be made obsolete by an identical app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cash grab. Continual regression in utility; constant interstitials asking for users to upgrade. Will switch to a new platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for a number of years and I just noticed that with the limits, the free tier is basically unusable. The pricing is also ridiculous, I have to convince a group of 5 people now to each pay 5 bucks a month to enter more than 3 expenses a day? The math is easy to setup in a google sheet so not sure what they think they're doing with putting an essential feature behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have recently started to limit the amount of expenses you can add daily on the free version. This app is now completely pointless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and a fixed number of expenses? Bad idea of monetization"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless since they started force feeding you split wise pro. Don't bother. Easier to use Google sheets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app, really a good utility when you sharing anf tracking expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was perfectly fine on the free tier and I wouldn't even mind seeing banner ads at the top or bottom, but with the timer and limited expenses per day it's just unbearable to use. I'm searching for another app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ever since they imposed a daily limit of 5 transactions on the app, it's become completely unusable. I've been forced to switch to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth to pay for the app to use it to its full potential. Just download a free one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely limited unless everyone in the party gets a subscription. Hard to convince a group of friends to use the service since everyone has to pay for basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app, until it started to limit my entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too many ads, time to rate it low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very ennoying features were recently introduced to push users to the payable version... It became very user unfriendly..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Holding users to ransom for adding expenses daily by blocking. Poor way to monetise your app developers. I am uninstalling Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be very good, but now they've made it unusable without paying with the daily transaction limits. Oh well, back to spreadsheets I guess"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"More and more feature stripped away from the free tier daily. Barely usable anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable for free version now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good efficient app to split bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent 500/500"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Five years of loyalty, and now the app wants me to pay for basic features? 🙄 #premium #subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Conned me into a year subscription. Will never use again. No one likes been cheated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"4 expenses per day is nothing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"At first , it went well but the amount divide into 4 people is wrong. Also it was mixed up that will get us confused. Pls fix it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!! Would be nice to allow to enter 'transaction date' as separate date from 'posted date' whenever they are different."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over a decade, and the recent changes limiting expenses and imposing delays on adding expenses are quite frustrating. However, it's a smart move by the product team to encourage users to transition away from Splitwise !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good yaar. I don't wanna type more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the crazy pay wall they placed now, the app become completely unusable. Over the years it improved better and better, but now they became greedy and became useless if you don't pay the subscription, nonsense for an app like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Look how they've massacred my boy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now unless you pay..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good when it was free.. now you are asking for unnecessary subscription charges."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was 5/5 until i suddenly ""maxed out"" on transactions with no notice!! Plus a countdown anytime I wanted to add the next one?? This is worse than a few ads!! Plus, $5 a month?? I can just use a Google Sheets at this rate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fantastic app for tracking expenses for groups traveling, doing activities, etc. They now limit how many expenses you can input to 4 per day, and they constantly hound you to upgrade to the paid version, Splitwise Pro. Very disappointing and will not be using this app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses per day to an unusable amount without paying a large amount. They got this one wrong. Will be moving to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nope, was great, but not recommended anymore since they added a subscription-based paywall for the most basic feature of adding expenses (as well as a frustrating ten second timer before that). I'd rather use a spreadsheet than this app filled with greedy dark patterns now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywalled and subscription based now, not worth the time anymore, a shared google sheets with a little bit of time spent on formatting is more effective now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was your user since many years... May be since 2018. But sadly, I will have to look for an alternative because you made your most basic feature as paid (premium) feature. Even sadder is that you are charging an amount which looks very high for a feature I could create using basic excel scripting. We like the convenience of use. You have hurt your core users to earn some quick money. Shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version now has transaction limits (3 per day) and you have to wait 10s to add them while it shows you an ad. Sad how companies have to add annoyances and make the app less efficient to force you to buy the subscription..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requiring a subscription to add just a few expenses? No, THANK YOU. Developing good apps, YES. One time fees, YES. subscription, NO. I will NOT support your greed. You used to be great, now you are just a great milking app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free app no longer able to input more than 3 payments what a money oriented decision?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have to wait 10 seconds every time you want to add an expense, unless you pay an extortionate monthly fee for the pro version..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't make any sense to cahrge for basic functionality. Could have aaded premium for advanced functionalities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too bad. Only allow 4 expense a day. This app is not for group as everybody need pro. Which is more than put trip cost 😕. Don't download and waste your time here."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"notification and monthly tracking is very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They use very annoying way to force to purchase premium, just waiting for some another good alternative to come up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but Daily transaction entry limit, looking for better alternatives now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are limited to entering 4 expenses a day. I used to love this app and recommend it to friends and family, thats in the past now. I understand money needs to be generated but nobody is gonna pay 3eur a month, thats ridiculous. I would have considered a fairly priced one time payment. Im going to start using Tricount from now on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removed core functionality and put it behind a paywall. I'd gladly pay a one-time fee, but a monthly subscription for an app like this is not reasonable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How can they limit expenses entry? Now this app is not worth."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cheap move from splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app for maintaining your financial splits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Automatically dues got settled up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A simple mathematics app wants you to pay a subscription fee after just 5 expenses a day..worst!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting only 3 per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Solves problems of splitting money when travelling in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Need to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app. it would be neat if it could with my wise account, so I didn't have to make the payment separately"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of 3 expenses. 1 star till fixed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best app for this function, but 3 expenses a day and forced waiting times makes it tremendously worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Retarded for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for keeping records of your monthly bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Super annoying with new limitations on the number of free entries per day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Péssimo ter que baixar esse app ruim pra ver as despesas Nao recomendo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I know why they changed it but awful now - limit to the number of expenses per day and cooldown to add expenses. Other apps that don't look this are available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app until your whole group have enough money to subscribe I'll find another alternative app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very simple to manage payments with friends, esp on trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rating reflects limit for recording expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly easy to use...makes money management on holidays so simple. I love the new feature which allows you to connect to your bank making settling up quick and straightforward."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very limited entries allowed per day for basic user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of 3 transactions and the subscription prices for just expense management are absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A superb tool, its missing a ""closing"" component. When all members have finsihed encoding their expenses, it should allow a user to close his expenses and when everyone is done, then it prompts everyone that it is closed and ready to settle the balances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth the subsciption fee. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Recently they added limits to the number of daily transactions to force users to upgrade to the Premium version. I hit this on my most recent trip and it was an inconvenience. Why should I invite new users to use the app if we won't even be able to add all our expenses? I have no issue with Premium unlocking extra features, but now a core feature is locked behind it, and I don't see why I should pay for basic app features all of a sudden."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is limited to 3 transactions per day, with ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The previous free version with unlimited expense input was what made this app great. There is now a paywall to get that same daily expense input. I am not going to use Splitwise anymore, nor will I recommend it to anyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise limits the number of expenses you can enter per day. This is ruins my experience and does not motivate me to purchase the ""Pro"" version. That should just have annoying ads instead. I will never use them again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day in the free tier!!! what?!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and fast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow. Talk about a fall from grace. This garbage developer continues to neuter the free version, only allowing 3 entries per day. I will use an Excel spreadsheet before I pay a recurring subscription for this app. One time payment? Sure. Get real."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice to matain record and easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add more than 4 transactions per day without Pro subscription and need to watch 10 second Ad for every transaction added after the first."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until they started restricting how many expenses could be added for free. Will not be paying for the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This used to be a great app. The monetization has made the features in this app so limited. I would buy the app if it were not a subscription model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use! so much better than doing the maths yourself!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Instead of forcing to buy pro, you can provide 1 to 7 days premium pack. In my case I just use it occasionally once or twice a year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added a limit to the number of expenses you can add per day for free. After being Splitwise user for years I'll be moving to a different service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using splitwise since 4 yrs but now it seems that the addition of transactions are limited which is totally disappointed...i have switched to another app .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do they have to be paid all of a sudden? Smh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is very nice app. It is useful for payment splits. I like this. Suggestion - Please add About section to mark alternate contact details or even link to payment method, if a user has any scan code for payments like Google pay, Apple, Paypal. Please also add a way to do a draft to review for others before we submit the expense details."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number if expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So much of advertisement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allows 4 transactions per day. Doesn't fulfill the basic utility of using an expense app. Very pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"These guys think they have built Youtube Primium, 149/month or ads per entry 😂. App is good but, we hardly use this once a month. And the premium is not reasonable. Minimum ad was fine, but showing 10sec non skipable ad is just too much. When we have free alternatives like PhonePe with same split feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont understand the decision to limit daily transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Boon to trip expense calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new 10 second wait per expense filed is really annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best. Not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great at beginning, now free version unusable because of Ads. EDIT: I switched to Tricount, 100% recommend doimg the same!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the entry of no. Of transaction will make you fall down. Thing and brainstorm before taking these kind of crucial decision. Uninstalling the app. PS:- was using the app since last 8 years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a great app. Now you can add at most 3 expenses per day, that is disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best for to manage group expenses,just simple with all possible option of splitting money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app, as a tool, is extremely useful, straightforward, with a nice UI. 5 stars for the app. The newlly introduced daily expense limits are clearly a method to force the users to pay. Are the charges justified? Imo, no. Especially when there's plenty of other fish in the sea. Unistalling the app for the time being. Will possibly check again in the future, hoping the daily limits are gone. 3 stars overall - taking into account the app, its usefulness, and the daily limitations and charges."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless after paywall after paywall has been added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Update: Splitwise has changed their policies to enforce a 3 transaction per day limit on their free account. I'm not inclined to pay $5 a month just to use this app, but unfortunately they do not offer at one time fee, which I would do. Taking off one star, but still a great app. Original: Awesome app for keeping track of who owes who, especially on group trips! Does everything you would want it to do in an easy and straightforward interface. Kudos!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expenses addition limit is too bad. Running Ad would have been much better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Makes family budgeting a breeze"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As a long-time Splitwise user, I'm deeply disappointed by recent updates. Limiting basic features unless users pay for a premium subscription feels greedy. Adding insult, they've imposed daily expense entry limits, hindering efficient finance management. An ad-supported model could have been fairer, but it seems profit trumps user experience. I'm switching to alternatives like GPay Bill Splitting, where fees and limitations don't domina"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant, easy, flexible tool to fairly and accurately manage group expenses in any currency."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is legitimately the worst cr(app) I've ever seen. It's supposed to ""simplify"" transactions. But it means lots of money going everywhere, and if you don't follow its debt structure 100% well you're screwed.. Just make it so everyone pays everyone irregardless of the number of transactions. And just deduct the smaller sum of two-way debts. Would be much easier to keep track of the money when it shows up on your bank account. This is just a mess, good luck settling any debt using this garbage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good for basic functionalities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limit is too cumbersome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise USED TO be great amd deserved five stars EARLIER. But the recent update has limited 4 entries per day for free versions. Since we add all expenses in one day, this daily limit makes the app unusable. If they want to restrict features in the free version, then they can keep a reasonable monthly limit. I am switching to another app due to the new update in Splitwise !!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app I recommended to all my friends not now it's a money grab. You have daily limits and it forces you to watch a few seconds advertisement to buy the monthly and yearly cost. It makes no sense why an app like splitwise needs $10 a month to run. This is awful business practice and would recommend others to find a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app, until recently, was a glorified calculator that made sharing expenses a little easier. Splitwise has turned it into a very expensive, very frustrating, glorified calculator. If you want to put in more than a few expenses per day, or if you want to avoid long, intrusive ad interruptions and 10-second 'buy us or wait' breks, use a different app. There are plenty. Edit: I was not informed enough about the owner of the company, so I've edited to make this review clear and direct."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restricting to 4 entries per day is too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesnt allow to add expenses after certain limit which is not acceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Per day transaction reduced significantly....they are becoming greedy...this basic feature doesn't need any maintenance so why are they trying to charge so highly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It was good but now it asks for premium top much , I understand that every business is to make money , but I will suggest to add more features first instead of asking for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"wait 10 seconds to read the full review.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is amazing and very helpful in managing expenses while going on Trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"now you have to pay :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Functions to consider 1. to be able to filter by category and see the details. 2. To allow create own category for easier identifying expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"unusable free version since can only input 2-3 expenses. do not download if no intention of paying monthly subscription for the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden we are limited to three expenses per day, with no warning"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day makes this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now they're making it impossible to use on the free tier. First they started making us waiting ten seconds between entries. Now I'm being told I have to wait a full day before I can finish entering my expenses. Absolutely ridiculous. I have no problem with the app being supported by ads, and I have no problem with them adding additional paid tiers with extra features. But to take the most basic, essential functionality away from the free tier is inexcusable greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"While advertisements are acceptable and can be bypassed using ad blockers, I've encountered a slight inconvenience with the pro subscription. It seems I must make inapp purchase (pro subscription) to access certain features and add new payment entries. Considering this, I'm exploring alternative applications. Uninstall!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Works pretty well except that they force a 10second wait and buy Pro advertisement on you every now and then."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was good, but never good enough to pay a subscription for. After many years of using it, I've ditched it. So sick of subscriptions for EVERYTHING nowadays. There are other free alternatives out there, I encourage you to use those instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It can't even calculate properly on who owes who the correct amount. Had to do it manually."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. Limits on number of transactions. Going elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"User experience has been made terrible over the years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful app, do what is supposed to do"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's become useless now without pro version. Good luck with all your pro users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free, pointless and impossible to use without paying now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great back in the day, but the mighty has fallen. The app is just a pay wall now and you can only add 3 expenses per day if you're not going ""pro""."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Limits on free users makes me unwilling to waste my time giving this app a real chance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hassle free split between the group, and real time update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Still trying to push this disgusting policy eh?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this application! The only app you need when going out with friends in vacations and need to intelligently keep track of all your expenses. Wormly recommend this application!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free app is useless.. only 4 entries a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Has been useful for years and understand the push to get people on subscriptions, but upwards of £40 a year is way too much for the value the app provides. Sorry. Would have happily paid around the £10 mark."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Superbbbb!! Money baggers are in Now "" Go Pro "" lol Worst app time to Uninstall... Time to Split Karo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"As with all recent reviews, I am shocked by the £4/month price for an app that does basic maths conveniently. I'd hope to pay a one off small fee or at least expect to pay 1/10 of that for the functionality. I don't need bells and whistles! It is still a capable bit of software, just over over priced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"greedy app owners."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How to kill an app with greed. Customer sentiment is underrated. I wouldn't mind ads but these free tier restrictions are ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Only 2 entries per day , and its ask to take Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 second ads + limited daily entries (3)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Textbook example of service enshittification. It was nice while it lasted. 2024 was the year they decided they'd gorged enough on AI training data and figured it was time to test free user patience to destruction. Adios amigos!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too expensive for what it gives. App will die."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was fine until it started forcing Pro!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now the app become useless after update, greedy people loose their major customers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited daily transactions make this app useless for things like trips where there are several expenses in a given day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nay to the daily limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After 3 expenses asking money !! Stopp using splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dikha di na apni aukaat"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New restrictions bully you into paying for Pro. The cost of this is far too high – £40 a year! I'd consider paying for Splitwise, but £40 is far, far too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app to record and split expenses with effective settlement (min. no. of payments for settlement) :-)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"a very good app for maintaining the udhaar and spendings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free and now you have the balls to charge after 4 entires. I hope you go out of business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with paywall after 4 expenses. It used to be great. Sad that they changed their practice. Moving on to another app. Reaction to answer from Splitwise: There was no confusion. The free tier used to be good (before you introduced your paywall), now it is not. End of story."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The have become too greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I USED TO love Splitwise and often used it. What was once basic and fundamental aspects of the app are now part of the paid version. They've simply decided to take value away from their app rather than continue working in development. Quite disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works ok, but everything is payed now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been a user of splitwise for around a decade. I understand every business needs to make money but putting a limit on the number of expenses that can be added shows how little they care about their customers. They could charge their customers premium for premium services but to totally prevent the customer from doing the most basic function is totally uncalled for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy to cap the number of expenses you can add in a day for free version. Have been using this for years and never had a problem but I guess devs got greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This has been a game changer for long trips and festivals. Pro features are good although I wish it wasn't subscription based, I just want to pay once."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This really really complicated APP needs subscription to work, because adding a few numbers together is so soo sooo complicated. 40 EUR a year? Spotify is 10 a month. Netflix is similar. How is it possible? Creating content costs millions of dollars. Adding numbers to each other costs nothing... But still you want more or less ⅓-¼ the price. I suggest everybody to DELETE the app immediately. It is pretty much useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From best for worst now. Not recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It is a decent app, but I've heard that they only allow 4 transactions to be recorded in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Real shame about the new limit to how many expenses you can add in a day with the free version. Used to be a great app, now rather annoying..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"this very much helped us on a girls' weekend away, enjoying food and wine. Once I got the hang of it, it was easy to use and split the payments equally between the group or just between one or a few. Saves the nightmare having to manually square up at the end, for which I am grateful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Super bad UI. No way to add more than 3 transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easiest way to manage group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app that really simplifies group expenditure, stops you having to worry about who has spent the most on a trip out. would highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good but then now they ask to buy,which is the worst and you cannot add more than 2 expenses in a day if u don't buy ... worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice and systematic app. Was able to settle complicated transactions very easily for the larger group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not so user friendly app. Settle Up app is simpler to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you kidding me? First the 3 transactions per day limit and now app is crashing on start. Are you purposefully sabotaging your app? Hey other users, please tell me alternative of splitwise. Splitwise has been a great and helpful app for so many years but it's time to move on. Bye splitwise ♥️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You suddenly can't add more that some 4 transactions on the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to share expenses on the move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the update, it's become unusable. Limited entries per day defeat the whole purpose. Deleting and moving to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable unless paying for the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been user for many years, convinced lot of friends to join and use it when we went out with them. Not anymore, basic feature likean expense is very limited (basic spreadsheet feature, should not be limited like it is, thanks but no)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Feels like SplitThrice than SplitWise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app to track payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Look for an alternative. They've ruined good app with a paywall. A real shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 4 expenses daily! What a great way to ruin a nice app! Don't bother, find something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app whilst visually quite compelling lacks a major essential function, which unfortunately renders it next to useless. The whole point of this app is that you never have to transfer any money. For this to work, when you are making a transaction, involving say three of your group of ten friends, the app needs to tell you who is the most in debt considering those three people and it should then default to that person making the payment. Without this being visible, things will never even out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited the number of expenses one can add daily"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience. Expecting Google to create new features like Splitwise on Keep App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be better but after the added pay walls it's almost unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Limiting transactions by day it's not convenient 😒 now I'm using another app instead. End of the story."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It forces me to buy premium by putting limits on the number of expenditure. And that actually makes the free version unusable. Its not worth it because monthly subscription for an app like this? Really? It's not worth it! The developers are too greedy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a fantastic app until they completely crippled the free offering. This app is pretty much useless unless you're 1) completely organised and add all your expenses as soon as they're incurred to split them over multiple days; or 2) willing to pay for ""pro"" features that are free in other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version became useless and annoying, especially for travelling expenses. Pro version price is overpriced for what is, plenty of other free alternatives in the Play store, or even a simple excel/Google sheets spreadsheet does this job as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Getting worse day by day.. more and more limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Everything is perfect about it. But that limit thing and 10 sec delay if you are about to reach your limit is not so good. Yes, I could pay one time payment but subscription based model is not so good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is no more usable. An option should be there to use the basic features of the app by seeing the ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a great app but the recent limits have made this almost unusable. Unreasonable to expect an entire group to pay for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become useless with only 3 transactions a day. For a casual user a subscription makes no sense. I'll be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Man this app is seriously encouraging competition these days."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited the number of expenses to an unusable 4 per day. The pro version is hidden behind a subscription model instead of one time payment. Have to look for alternatives now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy and functional to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useful only for pro members"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was such a fine app, then they decided to show ads every now and then which is still fine. But setting limit to the number of expenses you can add per day, is some greedy bs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't open on OnePlus 11r mobile phone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They put limits on daily transactions on free mode. Hate it now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"When it works. It's pretty good. Everytime you navigate away to another app, like a calculator, it loses the amounts already entered. Also, please remove the swipe feature within the app. Useless and also loses data entered on previous page when accidentally swiped or when selected a new method of splitting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier it was good now it is just an advertising machine. I got it, Everyone wishes to earn money, but these ads are non-stop."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switching to Spild. Uninstalling Greedy Companies. Daily expense transaction limit is a poor business strategy and Indians would say Adios to this app. Won't get Pro just for an app that I use like 4 days a year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Only 4 transactions allowed per day for free version is atrocious"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would have happily paid INR 100-200 per annum. But INR 999 for this is just greedy! Time to move on from once a legendary app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ripping up years of good will and taking user base hostage with free tier restrictions for forced monetization is disgusting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Make our life easy,, really productive, The only suggestion: View group totals, This month, last month, should start with settled up date. Photo feature goes with pro version only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now venture capital money has ruined it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads *every* time you add an expense. And you can only add 5 expenses per day??? Ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Capped expenses in free version has ruined Splitwise. It used to be great. After using once or twice a year for many years (primarily on group holidays), new limits on expenses on free version mean it's not worth using or recommending any more. Not close to being worth $80aud per year. Checking out alternatives and deleting account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 records in a day.. unrealistic.. deleting the app right now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Daily limit makes the app almost useless unless you get the pro version, which is way too expensive. Terrible change in policy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"unnecessary ads and only few times of adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years sporadically but now the app was rendered useless by the daily limit for the expenses you can submit. Bye-bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New waiting times are arbitrary and awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall'd. Not even an option for a one time buy, only pricey subscription models"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since they added the daily expense limit and the ads for every expense you enter, this app is not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just not worth it anymore. For an app the processed numbers, the maintenance cost shouldn't be so high to warrant such an high cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice and convenient to use with regular social circles, trips, and all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not fast enough"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a fantastic app ruined by corporate greed. It used to be the go to for expenses now it goes straight to trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have added a 10 second delay to irritate users into buying their product. Haven't seen a cheaper tactic by an app ever."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Huge paywall, time to leave to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app, please suggest alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"barely usable in free mode with limits to usage amounts at this point it's back to old school and you do the calculations yourselves."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a world of middle class"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's a pretty good app for splitting and simplifying expenses. However, they have transitioned to a paid model with a poor UX for those who want to remain free users. The main issue is the cap on transactions per day. I've uninstalled the app for this reason."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally made every feature paid which made it worth installing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying 5 dollars a month for a glorified pen and notepad I used this last year and it was great. Tried to use it again this year for the same thing and all of its basic functionality is paywalled. I'm not giving them a dime. It's going in the trash where it belongs, and I will do the same thing in the same amou nt of time with a google spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"paywalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you ll be very annoyingly tried to buy the pro version. disappointed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for groups of friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"waste"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New unannounced update of 10 seconds timer and maximum daily number of transactions renders the base version of the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Get some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for premium. Seems like they don't want that people can use their app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable with the free version. Will be looking for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment tier made the app useless. Should not force 10 second adds or limit the number of daily entries. Will go for a more reasonable alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, had been using it since 2012, got all my friends on it whenever there was some expense to be split. The recent changes have put limitations which make the app useless if used free. And paying 40$ a year for such a basic app doesnt really make sense. Save yourself time and headache. Use one of the 1000s of different apps serving the same purpose."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is the greatest example of failure of ""freemium"" model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be very useful but has now become completely useless after they introduced the daily limits in the free version. I wouldn't mind a one-off purchase fee like there is for many other apps but a recurring subscription simply isn't justified for users who don't really use it on a daily basis."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires an overly expensive subscription to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good except I had my phone in Spanish briefly and now the entire app is in Spanish. I can't figure out how to make it go back into English."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The payment push made it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a failure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The latest update made the experience of splitwise worse. I used to recommend it to all of my friends but lately it has been very bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was a good app once now its not usable due to limit and ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using it for many years, and it only gets better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How to send a company down the drain, step 1. Make your free app into a forced paid app with Multiple Ads and limit the transaction to 3. Beautiful business plan. Adios"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy and less to think about on holiday. Fab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The old version was great.New version has too many ads.And transaction limit per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes sharing with friends easy. Use it every holiday when we go away with others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be useful, now you can't enter more than 5 expenses a day after watching 10 seconds advertisements. Not worthy. There are better and free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for YEARS & the devs have rather recently decided to steadily chip away at every part that made it fast/easy/convenient. The increasimg ads and the exorbitant paywall have finally reached a boiling point for me. I'll be wrapping up my last existing group, settling up, and setting off for greener pastures. So long greedy devs! Don't worry though you'll be an (in)famous addition to some economics or behavioral studies classes... as a case study for what not to do..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use app that allows you to keep track of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gives incorrect information like crazy. Not reliable at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app for students and friends I just say Thanks Split wise Time 💕💕💕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"a daily limit to force people to pay premium, seriously?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once an incredibly useful app that was wrecked by greed. Ten second waits to enter an expense. Daily limits on number of expenses entries. This app is useful but ultimately just takes the place of a spreadsheet. I, along with the vast majority of your users, will not upgrade to Splitwise Pro. SHAME ON THE OWNERS OF THIS APP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new waiti time and max 4 expenses per day will be the death of this company. Everyone is already seeking an alternative. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yes. I want to see ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth the penny, pro version doesnt make any sense for such a basic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. They pay walled it to only be able to add 3 expenses per day which severely limits how you can use it. Unfortunately also limited to a subscription model at 30-48$ per year. A big part of these budget splitting apps is convincing others to get it so that you can do the finances together. I can't in good conscience recommend getting this anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Why will anyone pay for adding expenses. Your business model is itself flawed. You are simplifying something which could be done in a calculator. Still people will only use it for their convenience. Hope you never succeed with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoyingly not useful anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good but charges are very high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expensive premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removing basic features from non-premium version is the trashiest way to get more customer base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The login to this app from a new device is real pain in the back. While login it requires a code to be entered which they would send for verification to the login email id. But when switched to email app to copy the code, Splitwise app is resetting to start from login screen again with new code. That means you need to have two devices if you want to login into this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely usable without subscription. I'm not paying $4/month for a spreadsheet with a fancy UI, sorry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No more usefull after enabling daily transactions limit to feed expense data.. Install if you ready to buy ₹1000/year PRO purchase subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads and the daily addition limits is how you kill your userbase. The app should run in a freemium model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can now only put in up to 3 expenses per day. Horrible change to the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Capped the number of expenses you can input daily. They need a different method to monetize rather than pushing a pro membership"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now we need to wait an AD to add expense, this killed the app. Uninstalling now... Splitwise used to be an amazing and very helpful app, so sad it turned this way. Trying new apps now, Sesterce seems a good one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version was fine until it wasn't. The limit to add expenses in a day is 4. There is no use in getting the free version anymore. I also don't want to get a subscription and reward bad behavior."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a great app, but after adding an expense limit, it became almost usless. The price per month for such a functionality is way too high as an only option to use it. A big shame :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app. Now utterly useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit of adding 5 transactions per day on the free account is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the h3ll are you asking money for? For replacing people calculator? No thanks. I'd rather do the ""hisab/kitab"" the old way. 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even add expenses with out buying pro... Just find another app.. It used to be really good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simplify debt is the best use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dump pay wall. There are better apps out there that don't make you wait unnecessarily to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"offline entry not allowed and very limited entry allowed in same day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app ever for a group of friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy and convenient to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unuseful app after the last update limiting to 4 the expenses you can add per day. It's a pitty they ruined it like this, I won't use it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What was once an amazing free app is no longer good. Too restrictive in the free version. I'm ok to pay but make it a one time payment and not super expensive. Looking for other apps now..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Worth using this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting a pay wall ahead of the core function of the app is a really scummy move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a nice App but their greed ruined it. The limit on maximum entries per day is way too low and paying for the app on a monthly base is nonsense. A one time purchase for a few dollars would be more appropriate. At the end this app is nothing else than a excel file with a (more or less) nice UI..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app Jo paise daalo koii wapas hi nhi karta"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I like it a lot but now the limits on #expenses with free version are annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edited original review. Giving one star due to the bad decision where they decided to push for the Pro model and can only submit a limited amount of expenses per day. Bad decision and model. Will look for alternative after years of use and recommending it to so many friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is this daily limit things when there is already ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, finally it come with price. Just bit too expensive.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but now it's forcing users to pay for premium. Even restricting the number of times you can add an expense in a day which is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, so many restrictions for free version now and obtrusive push on expensive subscription makes it unusable. Shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get that you have to earn money somehow, the ""wait 10 seconds to add payment"" is fair enough, the ""reach the daily limit"" is too much, this change makes it a deal-breaker, it's just a premium app with a demo feature. Want a free app? Look for alternatives, but don't get caught in the idea that it has. A free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful for managing funds. especially big groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good tool to monitor expense among groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"new limit and monthly subscription with ads doesn't justify the value in the product, would be happy to pay one time fee at max."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app to track your expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would like to say that I completely dislike the app now. The whole point of the app was to add expenses to a list. Now you guys put a limit to the addition and want to squeeze money out of the users if they want to add expenses? Which idiot came up with this idea? No thanks. I mma uninstall and go with the competitors. Don't waste time on this app. You guys are the latest to get added to the list of companies who shot their own foot after Hashicorp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not happy with this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps ever! Simple, intuitive, full of features!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great idea, great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Post implementation of restrictions for free users, its been a nightmare. Planning to move on from this app to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The subscription model makes it useless - will find an alternative soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really unimpressed with the new limit if you don't pay for Splitwise Pro. Makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a 5 star app few years back. Now they are focused on subscription based model. There are better apps available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They make you wait 10s before adding an expense. There are free online alternatives that don't even require downloading the app and don't make you wait like that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous rate limit to 3-4 transactions per day... Used to be such a great app but the pro model ruined it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Using this app more than 6yrs. Now it is difficult to use this app since there is transaction limit. Please do the needful otherwise we need to shift other app. Thanks in advance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is going through enshittification."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but now forces you to pay for just adding a few items, don't use shitwise, it's not worth it,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For adding each expense, it is showing ads And limitng to add only 5 expenses a day. Always asking for go to paid version. Worst service from app. Migrating to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was a huge fan of Splitwise. It saved budget of our trip so many times. I recommended it to everyone. Recently I found out that the limit is only 4 transactions per person per day and ads. Great disappointment. Ok, ads i can relive, but limit is terrific. Good luck with your new commercial model. You lost 1 more fan."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I love it. But is just stopped working on my Zenfone 9 with Android 14. 😢"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app won't let me add more than 3 expense per day. Give us ad supported version or one time payment so we don't have to pay a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My brother and I used it in May and June 2023. What an easy way to keep track of shared expenses while we were trekking through Spain on the Camino de Santiago!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise used to be essential in my relationship and life. But they switched to a paid model, now it is virtually useless. Why would I pay for something I can do better on a Google sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introducing the pro subscription by forcing is really a bad impression on customer. Its customer choice to opt for pro or not you should carry your services wiyhout forcing customer to get the pro subscription. You can show ads to generate the revenue from other companies but you cant bound the customer to add only 4 expenses in a day or else take pro subscription. Really not like this type of forcefull subscription model inroduced by you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Es una buena opción, pero con los pocos gastos que deja ingresar a diario, no sirve de mucho. Mejor buscar otras opciones"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lame, 3 transactions per day? And If I delete one, I can't redo it and have to wait 24 hours"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started charging for everything, and a price higher than most music apps?? Not worth it for the pro, and basic got useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expensive subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 log of expenses per day is not enough. Another solid reason to boycott this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was fan of splitwise but no more. I am looking for another similar tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be great. Now absolutely useless unless you pay for the extortionate membership. You are limited to 3 expenses a day... Do not use for your own sake. Plenty of fully free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now free version has ads and transaction limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be an amazing app. They have dug their own grave by limiting daily expenses. Uninstalled, goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can live with the ads but a daily limit on the amount of transactions you can add makes the app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"used it many times for trips with friends. terrific app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the box"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What was once a free service now requires a subscription to use it properly. Terrible experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful tool. love the currency convert function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A versão grátis do aplicativo se tornou inútil desde que foi adicionado o limite de 3 transações por dia. O valor da versão paga não justifica as funções do aplicativo. Simplesmente voltei a usar uma planilha de Excel que cumpre a mesma função de graça."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Per-day transaction limits? Lol goodbye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of my favourite and most useful apps, but the new restrictions put un place to force you to pay £40 a year is ridiculous. Won't be using this anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"When I install the app everything is free but later they are removing all the features one by one and making it use premium version and it is very less often used. I don't think purchasing premium is preferred"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"ads suck though"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste due to the pay wall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simply the most useful and handy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This is a fantastic app...or was until they turned on an expense limit and ads for every expense you enter. If they had shown a little customer service and reached out with a first year discount for existing users, I would have paid. But so angry at the sudden change, I refuse to pay the small annual fee of $40 and will no longer recommend app to friends/family. Bad show Splitwiswe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not sure Friendly and full of spam ads , searching for alternative applications"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"good only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New business model is terrible 😕 you can add only 3 expenses per day🤣🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Definitely useful and a good UI, but the ads are super annoying and $5/month to remove them is way too high for something this simple. You're not paying content creators and the marginal cost of adding a new user is almost zero, so what am I actually buying here? I might pay $15/yr, but not $60."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New free version is unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became pay to use. 3 bills a day when you're doing it monthly is atrocious. Looking for a new app. Lost me and some friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"make life much easier!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"excellent in use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until they decided to charge five bucks a month for something people use a few times a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app experience has gone down since they've added limits on how many expenses you can add."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's like Tinder but for expenses. Designed to squeeze out as much money from you as possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have made it purchase only. I won't mind seeing ads but limiting the number of expenses per day...! Bad idea."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"doe free version unzwischen unbrauchbar. da man ein tägliches limit von 4 Ausgaben hat."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years, but now, with new updates, it became unusable as a free app. Only four expenses per day? Thank you, no! I will search for other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transaction per is very bad Increase the limit or Atlist ad timer any thing is fine."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is the perfect example of how to ruin a great app. It was so good that nearly all my friends used it. But now with this unrealistic limitation of adding 2 enteries per day, none of us are using this app and are moving to other app. Hope that's what the company wanted. Peace ✌🏻."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Best to Worst.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update useless and too expensive for a glorified excel sheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from great to useless rn"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The push for PRO is too bad, makes the app really unusable in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started charging, and Splid is good to use now. Splitwise used to be good when it was free. We are 7 people living in the house, can't pay $28 plus taxes every month to divide expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a long-term user of this app but stopped using it for a few years as I've gotten married and have less of a need to split expenses now. However, always remembered its excellent use case to track travel expenses and came back for the same. Saw negative reviews and they're absolutely spot on. You can't keep a loyal fanbase by rendering the free version of your app useless. The 3 transaction limit per day is a joke. I'm definitely one of your users you lost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice utility. keep it up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy, simple way to keep track of your friend or roommate debts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worked fine until recently when you get prompts to upgrade to pro version after every expense with added 10 second delay and can only add 4 expenses oer day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a fantastic app but they're now forcing you to move to premium, which is not worth it. An absolute disgrace. There are equally as good apps out there that are free. Don't bother downloading this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying to now sell for stuff that they gave for free before it a pain👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Same as others"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keep charging money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update of the app keeps crashing every time I try to open the application. I have tried reinstalling the app as well but it did nothing. After I open the app it freezes the whole screen and also keeps it that way unless I tap on the back button. All of a sudden it started behaving like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses per day? Why?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just pure Greed. It was alright when you implement ads and put 10 seconds wait time and coverd 80% of the screen with it. But to implement per day transaction limit you've reached a new low. I'll just keep manual tabs, not a big deal. Ridiculous for such a basic app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thanks for all the good times and trips! After the premium changes we just found and moved to another app (split... something ;)), but it was a fun ride with Splitwise. The 3 expense/day limit was a very bad idea. Best of luck!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not helpful anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free model has worked great for be, but now with the constant premium naggings and the 3 expenses per day limit it's no longer worth it. I will be moving away from this app as soon as possible, you can't expect users to pay you upwards of 30€/year to add more than 3 expenses per day. You are a glorified excel spreadsheet, this app ain't worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transaction per day? And in those transactions you have to see 2 ads!!! Are you serious? Time to switch to alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowing 3 expenses per day is insane. Add supported is fine, but limiting functionality that much will make me find another app for my next trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full of ads and limts! Unuseable... Dont get it, use the app: ""Tricount"" instead!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just updated and cursing myself... 10s for ad before adding expense!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"That's way too fast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great tool, but since they introduced the daily limit of 3 transactions it has very quickly become useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"All great ideas appear simple."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What greedy people. Are you not happy with the revenue from the ads? 4 expense per day limit ? Seriously ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier, it was good. But now it has put a limit which is very irritating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good now when started limit of transaction per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Been using if for quite sometimes, very useful during travelling, but recently they started to have ads and if we want to add more expenses it's becoming limited, user needs to subscribe first in order to continue adding the expenses. Quite disappointed 😞"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From tomorrow onward splitwise app not onnecting to the server"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for sharing expenses in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be amazing. Now they limit the amount of expenses you can log per day to force you to pay for their pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now that they have a daily expense limit, it's terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"such a great app!! especially when traveling with friends, thank you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is now obscenely crippled to the point of near uselessness, and the pro version is obscenely overpriced for anyone who only uses it for a few trips per year like I do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Whack that you can only enter a certain number of transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible upgrade"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice for tracking shared expenses in a large group. Do NOT use for sending/receiving payment. Information required goes way beyond minimum legal requirements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the best app for families and groups of friends. saves so much time and headaches"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The product was good until they came up with weird approaches to monetize the app. Limiting the number of daily expenses that can be added, expensive subscriptions, they've made it unusable. They brought us all onboard and have now added this paywall. Looking for an alternative that allows for easy migration of splitwise data."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app we loved so much sucks really bad now after the introduction of paid services."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I pressed back button accidentally and my entry got lost. Annoying. Then it got stuck after 10s countdown. :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent but now there are weird limits on everything if you don't have pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses per day, what kind of stupid idea is that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good Application to manage money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become unusable after the 5 entries per day limit. Uninstalling and looking for other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes it easy to track expenses when I'm traveling with friends and splitting hotel fees"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What happend? The free version used to be so good. Sigh.. not worth the price for annual or monthly fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Useful but very hard to understand what the actions on the app mean. Could be so much easier to understand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version has gone from being great to basically useless. Adverts and limits have made it horrible to use and impractical. Will be looking at alternatives as the paid version is stupidly expensive. What a shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Why to pay this much for just spliting the bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep track of spending"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely ruined the app. Adverts before adding expenses, I'm okay with that. But limiting the number expenses per day! Ridiculous! Why would I even take the pro version? I'm not even a regular user!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduction of the paid tier is overkill and has completely ruined the use of the app Totally fine to introduce ads/limit features etc., but instead they limited the core function of the app by limiting the # of transactions you can do daily"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many advertisement for pro purchase"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Anyone can edit others cgarges"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too many ads, need to wait few seconds to add individual costs. Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 2 entries and than boom 💥 ads to purchase the app. I have a suggestion for you give rewarded entries after watching video or interstitial ads. If you want to make money because everyone is not going to buy the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Suppr app excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Handy and I would have made a one time payment for such a useful app but you can get a reality check on paying a monthly subscription to add more than 4 expenses in a day. I'll enjoy migrating to your competitors you short sighted fools."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was really great application but nowadays they are asking for money to add expenses. Unexpected ("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"On the surface this sounds like a great idea but this app has caused nothing but organizational problems with my household. It's been a very confusing experience for everyone involved and I'm glad it works for a lot of people but there's just too many moving parts to make this a viable alternative to old fashioned paper bookkeeping."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It doesn't split expenses properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a favorite but with a recent update is limited to 3 transactions upload per day which is insane. Download ""Settle Up"" instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, the free tier is useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You added add and on top of that added limit for 3 enteries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"My roommate and I find this app indispensable for managing our expenses. However, one essential feature that's missing is the ability to mark individual expenses as paid. Add that and you're looking at a 5-star rating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful when traveling in a group. Simplifies life and eliminates the need for mental math."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application for cost splitting and keeping history."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good app! Now it just sucks Moving to Settle up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was the best app but now I frequently find miscalculations and expenses being wrong recorded to other people. Cannot trust anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another useful app that now tries to frustrate you into buying a subscription by limiting its free features. Not everything has to be a subscription. Go find something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier their app was good but now it asks premium for everything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love splitwise, even recommended it to many friends. But the app is very greedy now. 10 sec wait to add an expense. And only able to add 3 expenses a day. Premium is expensive for what it does. Switching to ""settle up"" app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now very 😞 bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Crashed after installation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"loving as we need to travel every month with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a really helpful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Perfect example of how to kill a great product in search of monetization. Good luck, I'm off to another solution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"अच्छे ऐप पर हग दिया डेवलपर ने। लालची लोग।"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty useless now with the new restrictions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"helps record transactions easily"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I do like this app, I got confused when ""simplify debts"" got turned on by someone else, but once I realised what it did it makes sense! Would be good to show info about it to other group members when it's on"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Becoming commercial. They should have started commercial that could have been better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit daily number of entries is really annoying. Moving to another, better, truly free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app to save expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update limiting the expenses that can be added per day just makes this app basically unusable for its main purpose which is tracking expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No ad. Best of best app for splitting all your expenses. Edit: I'm editing my review of 2 years back now I'm giving it 1 star as it has lot of ads and the worst thing is it limits daily entry of 3 transaction. And that too after watching ad. I'm shocked seeing the review from 4.7 to 3.4. You guys ruined yourself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Updated version is worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a good app to keep track of splitting amounts with friends or a large group. Very helpful👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ich schwör auf diese app nicht mehr, kann nur 4 Eingaben pro Tag adden, Wechsel App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"ready to use. convenient on phone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too greedy company, asking for more and more money, and too much restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just get splitser instead. You can add unlimited expenses for FREE and it doesn't have annoying pop-ups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is a gloried Excel sheet, with an absurd and unjustified pay wall. Simple things like adding an expense are limited daily and require an 10s ad each time you want to add something. A Google sheet does the same thing faster and for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"splitwise does an incredibly poor job of explaining to users how it works and how it's assessing who owes what and when. this limitation, and the fact that it's adjacent to Venmo and other cash management apps makes it feel like a complex feature rather than an app of its own designed to maximize the customer experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Down grading from 5 to 1 star. Of course they should push for premium. But they pushed harder. Been using it for many years. Probably it's time I look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool to track expenses in a group. Everyone in the group always has visibility of transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting submissions too much. moving to other free apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing people to convert to paid users!! DON'T RECOMMEND the app anymore!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Works well, love the new pay by bank feature too, makes things so easy. Can tell they are needing to make more money as they are pushing more into the pro mode. I do occasionally get a month of premium when it's convenient for a big trip but I don't use it enough to need it all the time. £40 a year is a lot for what it is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Giving maximum no of expense to add in a day is the the most useless thing that I have seen till date. Which is paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription seems very costly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is unusable, since the introduction of an daily expanse limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transaction limit is outrageous along with all the ads, I think I'll switch to an alternative. Any body has any recommendations ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would have happily paid a reasonable fee for unlimited additional expenses. Now I'll put the effort into switching instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ads started increasing which is bad. App is good and helps a lot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"just make sure to have all your expenses in before paying to save a head ache."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app! use it on any big holiday trips and always works a charm. also good for share houses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't bother with this app. It was good in the past but currently you get an ad between each entry and you only get a MAX of 4 entries for a day. If it was just ads, that's fine, but now that the app is essentially has a 24 hour useless period between every 4 entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has gone backwards! 1. Moving expenses from one group to another has thrown off the calculations which are now incorrect and the simply debt feature isn't working there. 2. Made a new group, added expenses, invited friends. Group shows all settled up, can't edit expenses to include more than just myself. 3. Sent an invite link for friends to join a group, notifications recived for new joinees. They are getting notified about other group expenses they are not part of. Get your QA in check"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app...can't update more thn 4 itseems per day... Can't make purchase of pro...fails while buying via upi"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly applying charges after 10 years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become too greedy to be useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not easy learning to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use while on vacation. No more check collection on your wallet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of entries on a single day is a deal breaker. Going to look for an alternative instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3+ expense addition should not be a pro feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Schade, früher wars mal ne gute App. Schaue jetzt was die Konkurrenz kann. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App sucks now that there is a limit to expenses that we can log everyday"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"we use for all sorts of things but Business Retreats & Forum are the best foe expenses...just made it too ez!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Everything I needed financewise during our vacation with friends 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now even the most basic function for which the app is existed in the first place is getting limit bounded behind a paywall. Ditching the app and going for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app, so easy to use. Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience after the new upgrade"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wth. Became paid app !!! That to 40$ a yr. Sigh. Everybody wants piece of subscription pie. Forcing every penny u can get out of consumer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Excellent application. (Well it used to be). Transition to Premium is understandable but it's even more expensive than Netflix in my region. Heading to alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was very good when free now charging for a month minimum is not fair. but useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pay $40 a year or it's unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to 4 expenses per day is insane for the most basic function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everythin thing os ok but waiting for 24hrs for entering one transaction is difficult so simply uninstall it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for tracking expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My review is same as other recent reviews. Unnecessary waiting time to create an expense and limited transaction of 3-4 per day has annoyed me enough to switch to a new app. The UI was interactive and smooth but the greed of developers (who are not able to find a feature people may pay for) will ruin this app for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 transactions per day limit in the free version. Switching to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would gladly do a one-time or lifetime payment. Subscription is just too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a daily limit ain't it fam. Find alternatives or prepare to lose users. There are thousands of similar apps to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The updated version is a robbery. You are limited now to 3 transactions a day and you have a 10 second timer when you want to add an expense. This is a basic app and we shouldn't be limited like that. I have been using it for years and will now look for an alternative. By Splitwise and your dirty move !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unable to specify venmo account, or turn off payments in app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but then they added timer intervals for how often you can add expenses. On top of that if you are a free user you will only be allow to add 4-5 expenses per day. Why have BOTH time intervals and a hard block??? If you want more freedom in adding expenses, use another option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"stupid daily limit. considering migrate to other platform if this restriction continues"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The product was good and the free mode worked well. As time went on, more and more upsells have been added to the point where I have to wait through a premium screen when adding my monthly utility bills. The free app has become intolerable to use and I will not subscribe and reward bad behavior. I'm searching for other paid apps to replace this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to monitor exp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update with free limiting options is really bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"please integrate an option for user to add their UPI ID in account details"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to pay to add more expenses, and watch 10s ad to add expense, why don't you just shut down the app and go f yourself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why bring premium?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. But the subscription fee makes zero sense. It's very expensive for an app which is easily replaced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits on expenses? Seriously?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update makes the app borderline completely useless. Everything behind a pay wall it's like I'm trying to play an EA game"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use and keep the account splits accurately"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless after adding a 3 expense/day limit. Going back to spreadsheets, sigh."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst. Useless. If you not upgrade yo will get so much add and you have a limit to write your daily expenses. waste of time. You will get so many other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy people - random Expense teacking limits - first u hook them saying free and then put in random limits and charge for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a simple streamlined app but now sudden limits on how many expenses you can add and wait times make the app a stuttering mess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful app. using it to track all my trip expenses, loan and borrow among friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can understand ads but making an appointment inaccessible after a few entries is stupid. You'll be losing a lot of customers very fast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes just made this app useless. Maximum of 4 expenses per day, plus a 10 sec ad for every input. What the hell? The premium subscription is expensive AF. I might as well find another app or go back to using spreadsheets. But I won't pay that expensive of an amount on a subscription basis for something that I can find or do elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The idea to impose a daily limit on something as simple as adding an expense is backwards."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app to use when travelling with a group of friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app wants me to pay them to add expenses. Absolute greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max of 4 expenses is somehow worse than the 1 a day they started off with. Your service does not deserve a yearly subscription, instead a one time purchase. I'm looking for excel sheets that I can easily use in a mobile format and uninstalling this as soon as I find a replacement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can't even put all the things from one trip than it first starts showing you ads and then asking for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added a limit of 3 transactions per day. Really bad move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Free teer is barely viable with 4 item limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Originally, it was a great app. However, after a recent update, you are limited in adding a number of expenses per day. Essentially, this renders the app useless if you are not a prime member."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Re: Splitwise v24.1.1 The implemented limits on adding the expense per day is really the painful part. Some of us can forgive the wait, Spltiwise can even put ads while user waits. But pls remove the limit when user adds expenses. Splitwise can even offer a different rate for the different type of users. We dont need all the fancy items under the full pro package, just create another rate for us who still wants to continue using the app but would use it for the minimum functionalities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the ads this app is of no use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now locked behind paywalls. 3 expenses a day is unrealistic. Have to wait 10 seconds for an ad before adding an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am using this application since 5 years. it's really helpful for bachelor guys to share their expenses. The experience is amazing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use! Makes splitting expenses a breeze....from calculating to paying. This app saves so much time and spares you the frustration!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app has made my life simple. I don't need to remember and write anything. Only just need to say, Bhai add on Splitwise. Rest all will be taken care of by this app. Great work Splitwise team.... Update: Reduce the subscription fee or make it one time payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 second wait for each expense is not a value add from a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Decent, but the pay wall significantly neuters it's usefulness. Tracking payments like this should not cost so much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go to app to handle trip expenses with friends. The new 3 daily expense limit is ridiculous. I would consider Pro but paying USD5/mo for an app I use once or twice a year is not acceptable. I would have considered a one time purchase. Another good app gone down the monetization drain..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So you became greedy! Super bad exp now with ads and limited transactions app is useless. Shifting to something else!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined such an user-friendly and useful app by restricting to only 3 transaction addition per day that too with 10 sec ads in between. Worst decision ever. Looking for a replacement app. Moreover the subscription amount is absurdly high, not even a one time payment structure. Just ruined such an awesome app. Worst decision ever."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good! I uninstalled it after having to copy everything to excel because the app told me in the middle of the trip that I can only load 2 expenses per day. What a jock! Just tell everyone right ahead that there is not free version anymore..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's a useful app, easy to use and I would absolutely pay for it if it wasn't so expensive. £40 a year is ridiculous. I would be happy to pay £10 a year, surely its obvious the developers would make more money this way? Probably a bit late now for them looking at the reviews how many people have abandoned the app. I'll continue using the free version for a little longer because of the history stored however would recommend new users find something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"had to purchase pro to settle living expenses but por benefits did not show up in profile."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible business practice to hide basic functionality behind a paywall. The app is now useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for more than 7 years. Recent changes to force people to buy subscription is a bad move. This recent trend of excessive capitalism has ruined one of the best and most useful app on Play Store. Kindly revert back to the old app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience after new updates making it exteremly limited unless you pay 2.99 euros per month which is too expensive for what it can do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit on expenses it's such a pain if you don't take a forced pro subscription. Will be switching apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The cost is too high"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad, they chose money over user satisfaction.. Asking for Money to do what was absolutely free previously. Uninstalled the app. 🙃"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this for years, now the free version is basically useless. Deleting it and getting a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic free version is restricted to such a small number of transactions, it renders the app unusable without paying a monthly fee. Only given 1-star because the option to award zero was unavailable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for subscription to add expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"with this limit of 3 txn per day have spoiled the app and entire experience. Time to switch the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand you would like to be paid for your service. I would've paid an one-time price but 30€ per year is ridiculous. And the free version is unusable at the moment. Sad you are this greedy.   There was no notification the monetization model would change. Now it feels like you lured users in with free features and once the users depend on the app you freeze their accounts and blackmail them to pay to continue using the app. I will change this review if you change the monetization model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad experience. Multiple adds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Splitwise, but thanks for the many years of service. Many users are disappointed now, and I'm looking for alternative app already. Pls recommend one. Thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This made our trip to the UK so easy to keep track of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love splitwise for trips with friends to keep track of who covered what"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to record and pay shared expenses with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for sharing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can only covert to USD which isn't helpful unless you use USD ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice and Easy to use app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was amazing app to manage group expenses. I would've put up with their decision to show ads for adding multiple transactions. But they're beeing too greedy by adding per day transaction limits. And the recurring payment option for upgrading to pro is too high for what it does, yes there are some added features with pro, but some of us just need more transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise is a great app, but it would be even better if group members could require approval before others add expenses. This would increase transparency and control within groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise makes life with roommates almost bearable, thanks to the way it easily allows us to split our expenses wisely. I recommend for anyone cohabitating in any way, even lovers!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app. I have been using it for settling expenses with friends for several years now. Makes the process so easy and transparent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect for trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer functionally a free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is incredibly useful if you're renting with people with whom you do not share a bank account. I highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app for managing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to capture who paid for what on vacation without much of effort!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to think this app was great. Now you went and changed it so it takes multiple steps to get my money. It used to go straight to Venmo. Now I set it to go to my bank, but it gets hidden in a ""wallet"". No thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is now pointless unless you pay the ludicrous price for pro. Plenty of free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is good, limiting daily expenses and monetising on pro subscription is atrocious."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"After many happy Splitwise years, sad to see the tough limitations on the free tier. Would be nice to be able to have a pay-once option for a given group. I'd happily pay that for each trip that requires it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible subscription model. Ruined the whole experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Fantastic until unreasonable limit to simply adding expenses - becomes unusable if not for a €30/person spend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update of limiting expense addition not good now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't tell you it is a monthly sub, only wanted to keep track of a holiday , only when you download does it then only work if you pay 3.99 per month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yeah. Why email?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"buggy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Even the basic functions of the app are not accessible now without purchase. To some extent, commercialisation is understandable, but such widespread profit-oriented motive goes beyond my understanding. However, the app is super easy to use, hence the 2 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"boo greedy developers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"hate it. whenever I see a note that i owe, i should see a btn to settle up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely worthy but limited transction for free users have been reviewed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use and simple way to track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"practically unusable after new update where only 3 expenses/day can be added. uninstalled and switching to alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wonderful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Takes some time to understand the logic and use the best split option. The features available have been restricted completely to push for sale. So today you can't add a foto, not add more than 2 expenses a day. Meaning this app is useless today. And if you want to purchase there is no lifetime offer either!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Only few transactions each day. Other than that a good app, but the greediness shows."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Too many ads, timed prompts etc. otherwise perfect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"too much helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app!!! is awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes life easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been my go-to app for the purpose it serves, for about 10 years now. Solid. Reliable. 👌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, but basically inoperable if you AND YOUR FRIENDS don't have premium. I have Premium myself but my friends had a really hard time using the app. Also it does not make any sense not to be able to use itemisation without uploading a picture first"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduction of splitwise pro ( a frustrating and costly model) made me uninstall this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helpfull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Prevents you from adding more than 3 expenses per day, and enforces a time delay between those expenses, to try and coax you to pay a $5 monthly subscription. Highway robbery for such a simple app. Been using happily for years but I very quickly found a replacement. Be more reasonable in your pricing and you won't lose more customers like me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Export function doesn't work even after paying so much for subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy to keep track of who owes money to who."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great, useful, convenient app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app ever for manage expenses for travel or events with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible changes. It has now become effectively unusable unless you pay for the premium version. I will remove it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hehe.not usable with out paid option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rated 1 star for making it pro and adding daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful during trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too costly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously?? You'll prevent adding more than 3 transactions a day? FU"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such as tragedy app. Limited to 3 expenses per day. Product managers should think more wisely. such a lame idea. Basic features should have been retained. Downfall has begun."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So cool !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Hassel free calculations. I am in love with this app, ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In the name of chart I get only single categorization.. Are you serious? Why I don't here drill down option. Why can't I have choice on charts.. Timeline of my expenses.. Etc I am paying yearly payment for what? To be able to add my multiple expense in a day? If I anyway have to export and do that on excel for analysis. Why am I paying?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is now unusable. 10 second waits for each expense and limit of 4 expenses per day. Got one wrong, deleted, still counted for the limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the only function of the app (entering costs) behind a paywall while other apps do the same thing for free is just not worth it. Get an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the perfect app with stupid subscription model and unusable free tier. One time purchase is acceptable but a subscription model with high fees while its used mostly once or twice a year is ridiculous. I'll look for another alternative. There are tons of free apps providing exact same features without predatory subscription model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 gastos al día de límite y un retardo de 15 segundos para venderte el premium me parece excesivo y muy invasivo. Creo que una modalidad con publicidad y sin limitarte tantísimo sería más acertada. Estoy moviéndome a Tricount, es una alternativa perfecta"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bit pointless, would be better f linked to payment methods"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really disgusting update for sure. Used to love Splitwise earlier but now have to look for other options like it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro is making everything so bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The max 3 items is sure annoying but the reason for 2 stars is that the permium version is actually bad and useless. It can only exhange everything to USD for full netting (why?) The receipt reading does not work AT ALL. The simplest online tool can do better in reading text & numbers this is 2016 tech. The premium charts and graphs are useless almost entirely. Nothing explains the premium at this point and worth switching to another app with up-to-date tech"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to work out expenses during group events."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't usually 1 star but lmao so garbage. Recently (and without notice) rolled out a sub only model so you can't add expenses if you're a free user. Insane that they think users would pay for a feature that's essentially just basic math. Just use excel or swap to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greediness has ruined what was once an amazing app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its barely usable if you don't pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolut rip-off. Used to love the app, but 3.99 for this service per month is a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 4 expenses a day now. And there are more ads. And You no longer can upload images. Is this company actually building new features or just removing old features and putting it behind a paywall. Dont download."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"La app se volvió virtualmente inútil después de que pusieron todo tras una muralla de pago. Hay un límite muy bajo de gastos diarios, lo que la vuelve pésima. Además, hay que esperar tiempo para ingresar cada gasto. Una buena app que se volvió pésina"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been a user for a while now. I recently uninstalled it due to the aggressive payment plan they started. Adding ads would have not been a deterrent to me. I have moved to other apps that do the same thing without charging a dime."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, just for adding infos do we need to Pay..….."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Godsend of an app for splitting costs for extended periods (weekends, holidays etc)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is the perfect app you can find when your group wants to share expenses with each other"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"West of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor business model because of current subscription plan. Free members can't add more than 4 bills in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I switched another app. For expense limitation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic version now limits you to a ridiculous 4 transactions per day. Time to switch to another app. Bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too limited now unless you pay for the pro version. Even if I could personally justify paying for pro, there is no way I'm going to convince all my friends to do the same."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All these features they took away to encourage getting pro are annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely basic functionality like entering more than three transactions a day is locked behind a paywall. Unless you are a mega power user, stay away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, but the recent update is disgraceful and makes it borderline unusable. You now have to wait for an ad to finish to add an expense, and you're only allowed to add 4 expenses per day unless you want to pay for the pro feature. Just an awful business model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not useful at all. they have set limits to add reviews otherwise you will need to pay money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was nice before it asked me to pay from 5th expense onwards"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thanks for the past 10 years. Officially deleted my account due to they have monetize the app very much. Full screen ads + 3 transactions per day. A failure move. Note: Please Google for SplitMyExpenses, is free! App to be released soon!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a great app for many years, but they started making some of the most basic features premium. Not really usable anymore. Such a shame. Am I willing to pay a few Euros for a useful app such as splitwise? Yes. But one-time. A subscription service for this little helper is ridiculous... Need to look for an alternative and so should you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits seamless entries forces to buy pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Only allows 3 expenses per day for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charge you money to enter more than 3 expenses now, you know, the basic functionality that should be included in the free version of the app. Happy to pay a one time fee for apps but I will not add a subscription for an excel sheet with makeup. Looking elsewhere for my new group expense tracking."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Would be great if there was a simple calculator in the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad decision to force everyone to be paid users by limiting number of expenses record"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand the necessity of funding for maintaining a service, but implementing such a significant change feels distressing. Please reconsider your approach to generating income, we users really feel betrayed by this update and this goes on to show why we can't depend on service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic decision to restrict 3 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not free anymore ; )))"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for YEARS and with the new update limiting tracking inputs per day I will now be deleting it. Sadly, this greatly limits the group expense filing and what was once a great app is now filled with ads and requirement to pay to input more. So sad to see it go and moving on to another platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Life without you is incomplete. 😅"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro makes this useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From unlimited shares of expenses to 3x per day. Transferring to other application. Not worth installing it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forces you to buy a pro subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app that makes group events easy to manage with regard to the money side."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Truly exceptional app destroyed by horrific business model change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For an app that is a glorified spreadsheet, a per-day transaction limit makes it absolutely unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update is a disappointment. When using the free version there's now a limit to the number of items (4) you can add per day. There's currently no option to have multiple accounts on a premium subscription, and each household member needing to pay for their own account is outrageous. Will be looking for a replacement app asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has been ruined by trying to force you to get 'pro'. Will not be using it again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing an ad to add expense would've been fine but not letting to add expenses till next day is absurd. Defeats the whole purpose of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They put a limit on entries per day. Feels like lootbox practices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a very good app. Now, not usable with the push for the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entry with add is absurd , will find a alternative and switch , hey developer our there ,if you are seeing this , you are great , but your team who is handling the advertisement section is going to kill this company, please make changes before it's too late . Sincerely - your user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow. Horrible change. I have no idea what happened to them. Find other alternatives. They are super, money hungry now. Great app is now ruined. They could have just put receipt image behind a paywall, instead of limiting daily transactions with so little allowance. Plus, they increased the pro subscription from $3 to $5 a month. At least don't raise the price if you're gonna put these bad restrictions. Move away from them. I have uninstalled it, and looking for an alternate now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise Pro? I'm never using this app again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes make app unusable. Cost is far too high for basic utility app. If you need revenue add more adverts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app forces you to buy the pro version if you want to add your 4th Expense. Pro costs $4/month or $40/year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the recent changes, they mess it up... Limited number of entries per day..disappointed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version used to be good. But now you are only allowed to have 4 expenses listed maximum per day. If you need more, you are forced to buy it at $4/month or $40/year. There are few others that are free to use: SplitPal and Splitser. I find SplitPal being better with more features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The addition of Splitwise Pay is nice but it's hard to send money for a single expense. Would love to be able to select an expense and just tap a single button to pay someone back for that expense. Right now I have to hit 'Settle Up' then 'Send via Splitwise Pay' then 'Next' then 'Pay'. Then I have to edit the payment record with the description of what I'm sending money for cuz for some reason the app doesnt save the description when sending the money. This part is clumsy & time consuming!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why this app is not completely paid so we can move to some another, what is this two- three transaction limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extreme restrictions suddenly introduced in pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"need i say more? the rating is trash for a reason"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Es muy triste ver lo que se convirtió esta aplicación, clientes que llevamos años utilizándola, debemos ver anuncios cada vez que agregamos un gasto y el limite de 4 es absurdo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't use the app anymore unless you pay. App is still free on the appstore which is deceiving. Its only a demo now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Baad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app but suddenly adding a shockingly low limit for adding expenses is scummy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. I use it to manage my spending."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Allows you to put in maximum four entries and then blocks you until you pay for the app. Avoid at all costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nonsense limit in daily transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get that you want users to buy your premium version but shoving the premium feature prompt every time I try to add an expense is not going to help and in fact expedite switching to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is a great idea, and used to be fantastic, until they locked down how many transactions could be added per day behind a very expensive subscription. The pro version might be worth a $5 one time buy, to charge that every month is ludicrous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app but it's incredible that they limited the free app to an unusable level. You can only add 3 expenses per day cmon guys 4 real? Terrible decision, will stop using after many years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My main and only app for splitting expenses. The pro version is worth every penny."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For everything they want pro version. Uninstalled it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pro version ads won't let you add any expense after 5 exp added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"luk at ze commence u guys gettin fudgeeeeed stop pay for basique feature plz"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good gear"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've used this app on 2 different girl's trips so far and it is so easy to use! we all just love it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Who the hell only wants to adds 3-4 expenses in a day that too with ads in between!!! Basically they are asking people to move to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a pretty solid app. Unfortunately it's completely broken since they forced the pro subscription to add more than 3 transactions... It's a shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore due to limit added for expense! Deleting the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app for a very long time but now that this paid subscription model has come into picture it has become super annoying to use it and I might look for an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Müll da zahlunsplfichtig, und damit schlechter all's tricount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect for maintaining n splitting expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for years. My housemates and I split everything, now my husband and I do. The new pay walls really make this unusable. If there were family plans or if one person in a group being pro stopped the nonsense for others in the group, I'd happily pay $40! But $80 for my husband and I to divide in peace when I could just use a Google spreadsheet to do the math for us is... extreme"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"add revolute or Google pay as payment option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Apps greed to earn the money has become a headache only 3 transaction a day....wth"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying money to potentially pay more money to people lmao"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are very intrusive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If you travel with friends and split the bills, one person can be in charge of paying for restaurants, one person can get all the cabs, another can book events, and you can use this app to settle the difference at the end. I love this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app without issue for years but now the free version is basically unusable as other reviewers stated. Will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good. But the new pro purchase cost is too much and the number of free entries are too less. It was a good app before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have used the app for years for tracking expenses during travels. However, not a fan of the recent changes where they are pushing users to upgrade to the pro version. Would consider upgrading if the fee wasn't so high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limits are ridiculous, everything I behind a pay wall now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This App is seriously the bedt invention for Group outings, or weekends even famiky vacations and it keeps waitstaff happy not having to split bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have their subscription and even after spending money you don't get proper analytics you require. I will suggest other to use other apps instead of staking split wise subscription. Also they have restricted 3 entry for non subscription users as well as ads. Better to look for other apps, there are lot of app for splitwise usecase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app is really useful but have to pay a monthly subscription is not a good idea. If there was a lifetime subscription it would be better (with a good price obviously) This is a really good example of how to negatively affect a good product"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Almost unusable unless you pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"immense greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why your app disabled third payment app and if disabled remove paytm why its showing paytm there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are now limiting the number of expenses per day even with ads. I can't remember to add something the next day now that there's a (new) limit added for free users in entries per day. Switching to a new app I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be the best but now it is useless if you don't pay for the pro version. They limit the number of transactions you can add per day. Why???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently added ads to the app with waiting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A fantastic app which dug their own grave by limiting it's basic features to pro users only. What a fall from grace."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why restricting the free user to add expense? It's just a calculation which can be done using Excel, will uninstall this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not working well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has become worst and developer has become greedy. Will surely stop ysing this app and start maintaining excel worksheet again. Thats way easier. Its free and doesn't restrict me or forces me to view ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for managing payments among each other. 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"DON'T DOWNLOAD IT. I've been using Splitwise since 2016. With their recent changes to the free version, the DAILY LIMIT for entering expenses is FOUR! For my own sanity, I will only work on bill expenses max twice/mo. To remove the max limitation (and now ads), you'll need to purchase their recurring subscription. I could've dealt with the addition of ads for using the free version. However, that max daily limit is a great way to show other businesses how to lose loyal customers quickly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After years of using it they ask for money to add more than 5 expenses, greatly, going to another app. So smart of you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"horrible with the new ad for forcing people to buy the pro version, what happened Splitwise??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great but now they have the worst monetisation campaign. Hide some nice extras behind a paywall, don't make the basic app unusable without paying. And don't make it so expensive for what amounts to a nice spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app will show ad everytime u wanna add something plus limit to daily expenses that can be added Worst App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why? Why put a limit on the amount of expenses each person can input? What a horrible idea this app decided to do. The whole reason for using the app is to make it easier to track expenses in a group but to limit it to three transactions is crazy. Excel does the same work and for free. Absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be good but now need to pay for subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used splitwise for around 7 years, but I'm switching to a similar app that doesn't limit how many entries you can make per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expenses update is minimised. Its not fair"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be incredible. We could add as many transactions as we wanted in a day, we could add photos for free and then slowly but surely they decided to turn every single feature into pay to use. Unfortunately have had to go for an alternative solution, it's getting unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gr8 app, luvd it..very usefull for keeping track of the daily/monthly expenses.. Kudos to the developers ✌️ 🤘"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transaction per day? Comedy... Now tons of apps out there which is far better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until they had a limitation of 3 inputs per day. Pushing every basic functions towards pro version. Not an useful app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Your recent update now forces everyone to watch an ad for splitwise pro. What a joke. Been happily using this app for free for years. Looks like a lot of people are unhappy with the new restrictions on the free version. I will also be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad model to reduce adding of expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying ads. Looking for an option. Will uninstall it soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A maximum of 3 daily expenses for a user without pro plan. That would be useless for this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added in unskipable adverts and daily limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"a great app to track your group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"User for 10+ years. They've added handicaps with 0 communication for the free version of the app. Time to move to alternate tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience with daily limit kn expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a very long time user for 5+ years, but now it has become unusable thanks to the developers greed. Can't add more than 4 expenses on the free version any more and the subscription is ridiculously overpriced for this service. I will move to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for family and friends for years, now. there are new limits as they push pro. I'll have to look for other alternatives. The basic functionality used to be ad supported."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Well, some basic functionality has been moved behind a paywall recently. Can't recommend this app anymore. We moved to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this app takes the stress out of travel with friends. focus on fun and not accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic monetization strategy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent change"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As a paid user of the Pro version, I'm displeased that they haven't added any improvements in years. Rather than spend effort there, the developers are ruining the free version for all the people I split bills with. Pro version has itemized bills, but still cannot edit the items (must add and remove). Still cannot do shares per item (e.g. someone is paying for another outside the group, or had double portion, or when an item has a quantity like for beers)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this for years on the free tier, didn't mind the ads. Now you have delays and you can only do so many expenses a day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be an excellent app, which has now been rendered absolutely unusable due to the heavy push on monthly/annual subscription. The fee is pretty high too for what it provides. I'd be happy to pay a one time fee, but instead in these conditions I'll be looking for a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads were started that delayed our addition of new transactions. Now, I have to wait a full day to add new transactions or else buy subscription. This is absurd. I ll find a new app to switch. The subscription is really high. If it was a one time fee, I would have tried to buy it. But current model is absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? Ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously expensive pro subscription model for a budgeting app with now bare basic features that do not suffice. Used to be a great app that I used enthusiastically for years. Now it sucks and they tanked it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful for group holidays and paying friends back or keeping track of whose turn it is to pay for dinner. Would definitely recommend giving it a go!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become junk trying to force the freemium model. Totally annoying with artificially added delays in expense addition. And then forced limits per day. This has been done in bad faith by some PM trying to drive up metrics. Classic bait and switch at play. This app is gonna rot and die soon. Somebody will come up with a free version and eat their lunch dinner breakfast, snacks and drink their drinks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using it for years and absolutely won't mind paying yearly subscription but it's way too expensive for this app! Its crazy. Do they expect every user to be willing to pay that amount??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is limit to number of expenses which can be added. And they want us to purchase pro version 149Rs monthly charge for such a basic app ? Are you kidding me Splitwise. Even a 5th class dropout from white hat junior can make this app. Disgusting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really bad decision of limiting entries per day even though there is an in app advertisement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app to track cashflow. After newest update this app require you to subscribe for basic funq. Will be looking for a replacement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"5 stars for how it splits the bill. Zero stars for assuming that the email address I logged in with is the same email tied to my venmo account, and that my friend's email addresses are tied to venmo. Huge mess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was most famous for tracking finances in my friend group. But due to the paid version this app is ruined now. There are free app available online where we can track our finance better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging is fine but limiting the expense addition bad. I will find another app to settle now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Bro, stop. I'm not paying $5 per month for a glorified spreadsheet. Why charge 1% of users $5 per month when you can charge 5% of users $1 per month?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing the pro subscription is really annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Poor performance. Doest not work after entering a few expenses and keeps asking for upgrade."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently full screen adverts with a timer have been added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until i discovered a limit on adding transaction. I have recommended this app to my almost all friends but now all of us will shift to new alternative.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is successfully killing it's loyal user base. Profit motive cannot come at the cost of customers!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Chiming in to say the same as everyone else: Used Splitwise for many, many years — but their recent changes have really made the app completely unusable for anyone not using the Pro version. Uninstalling and moving to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My best choice for split bill app before. now they put some limit for the expense you can put and imo it strip the core functionality of the app that we lookin for. Hope they remove the limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use Splitwise all the time for group meals, days out, even paying household bills etc. Super easy to use. Means you often don't have to exchange any money at all as I try and even out with friends and family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I must say, this used to be a good app, a very good app. But since you started aggressively promoting your premium version, it is impossible to use it. I am now searching for a new app and I will soon stop using splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally disappointed by the subscription prices!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"after some time it's just ask to buy a paid version and doesn't allow you to add new expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wants me to pay 999 per year now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice update for killing user base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, as well as they are annoying users to buy their pro subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. At start it was great and free version was awesome.. the they reduced the daily entries limit to 10 transactions Then they again reduced to 3 transactions And now they have led to only 1 transaction limit in the free version. It is the worst.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years, I really recommended it, but lately it's been a disappointment. You can only add one expense without advertising and a maximum of 4 per day. Rude that they take advantage of people who already use it wanting to charge for everything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Te hacen pagar para poner transacciones"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a great app, until the daily limit messed up the whole experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time of transactions also needs to be there, also use simple English"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become expensive Cannot add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont like this Pro Subscription. I will move out of this app soon!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and slow. Ugly interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This is also paid for few activity"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has literally become unusable, since the limitation on no. of entries being put behind a paywall. Rather than making better features available to ""Premium users"", the app has made basic entries paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a category defining app. This should not have been monetized through forcefully halting adding expenses at the count of 10 in the free version. I'm sure they could have grown in other ways. With such a wide userbase, they could have gone into accounting software and made millions of users on day 1. Yet they destroyed everything in one shot with the stupid move. Unfortunate, Regrettable and Sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This arbitrary limit feels unnecessary and punitive. It forces me to manually break down expenses or wait until the next day, which defeats the purpose of having a real-time expense tracker. Splitwise is essentially asking me to jump through hoops for a basic feature that was previously available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a cornerstone app. Since implementation of the daily transaction limit, however, it is no longer practical or reliable. It is now practically unusable on group vacations, when transactions abound, without shelling out money for the Pro tier. Look elsewhere for a dependable app for bill splits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another one down behind a paywall. 4 expenses per day with 5th after an ad, or else pay premium. Sorry split you gotta go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"don't even start"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful app. Greedy decisions made this a 1 star app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and limited entries behind a pay wall kills this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be okay but now with 3 limited transactions a day, it's pretty useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits the number of expenses. The primary use case is behind the paywall. Good luck with retaining a loyal user base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits and timers make the free version of the app really frustrating to use. I'd rather use a spreadsheet at this point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They purposefully made the free version basically useless and pro is overpriced for what it is, there are free alternatives. Now I have to migrate, which is really annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling because I can't submit more than one expense a day for my groups. This is absolutely ridiculous! Let me see a million ads instead of just blocking the MAIN FUNCTION of the app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app for splitting up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bonne application, depuis la mise a jour. On ne peut rentrer qu'un maximum de 10 dépense et ce avec 10 seconde de publicité... Sinon il faut payer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making the free experience worse as a way to force people into the paying tier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is more or less useless without Pro now! I would be down to support the app devs if they valued their product reasonably valued. C'mon £4/month subscription! Seriously? I can see myself paying that one time or £0.99 a year max for such a basic utility. Perhaps devs wanna re-evaluate your pricing model. You can probably get the same (or even more) revenue with economy of scale and have more people satisfied. I am moving to a different management app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't use the app without subscription at all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing app! Now you have a max of 4 expenses in a day unless you want to pay for pro. I will be looking for a new app or just keeping track of the math myself. Very disappointed and I don't think I'm the only one. Seems like a big mistake Splitwise..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"World 3rd class app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now. Terrible app. It used to be great. Sadly it's fallen out of touch with how users actually intend to use it, ie adding multiple expenses, in effort to make people pay for the paid version. You now have to wait for lengthy ads before you can add an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great App. Would have been 5 stars, until they suddenly started throttling the number of transactions you could add unless you're willing to fork out a ton of money. Way too expensive for the simple functionality they're offering. There are plenty of other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for splitting bills w the crew"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise for years. This new update requiring a monthly subscription is ridiculous. I would have happily paid a once off fee, but the amount for a monthly subscription is what I pay for spotify! There is no correlation for the amount of functionality you get. We're uninstalling and finding a new app. There seems to be many other options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With venmo group, this app is officially useless to me. Keep playing your ads every two seconds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'd give this 0 stars if I could. When using the free tier, you can't enter more than 4 transactions per day. This is basic functionality of an expense-splitting app, and should not be paywalled. Ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"gracias a esta app no volví a pelear por dinero"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do Not Waste Your Time Do Not Install The App USE Alternative apps Instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App only allows you to add 2-3 expenses in a day and not more. They should at least allow you to add expenses after watching ads. And for the pro, they should add a lifetime fee instead of a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't want to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now it just sucks. UNINSTALLING."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for 10 years, was amazing and have always pushed people in my friend/work circle to get it because of how easy it is to use. Now the app is not usable cause you need to pay $50 a year for the subscription. The free version was great for the basics and I occasionally get the paid one for big trips or events but unfortunately will now have to find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The ad feature was very irritating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Will be looking for an alternative expense app. Daily limit on expenses makes it borderline useless unless you are adding as you go, which I don't. Even then, lets hope you don't need to split more than 4 times in a day. Sadly, the new business model for most companies is now to take away free features and put behind a subscription once they've attracted enough users. Hope they make a U-turn on this but I won't hold my breath."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Got greedy and included far too many adverts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has put up a paid wall for the basic functionality it always had."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 entries can be add daily And no option to add date and time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What an idiotic way to lose your entire market base. Do you really think everyone in a group is willing to pay for an app that they use to penny pinch?! Stick to your Venmo style monetization and stop limiting transactions. The splitwise app is a ridiculously simple idea that is easily copied and its only edge over other apps was that everyone used Splitwise. But I suspect that will change really fast."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Very simple and user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Low to charge by wait time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just one word - greedy. Have already switched to another app, so I hope the forced ad update was worth losing customers like me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Moved to tricount, you should too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please keep this service free, just put ads. Surely your monetization team is doing something wrong, when the app rating is getting lower each day. Just wait until a new competitor shows up in the market. Won't be long people will get out of your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version unusable by the dayly restrictions on adding costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wihtout pro versions is completely uselss now, as they introduced expenses limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice, well organized, and effective. it's perfect for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Killed itself by limiting entries and making it paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't recommend the app since it limits adding expenses. The core functionality is behind the paywal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Decision to limit to 3 transaction per day is a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be 5 stars, now is pretty much unusable. Very disappointing move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The date till PRO wasn't introduced it was best in the Market, free version is turning bad to worse day by day, charging substantial 1000 for a year is way ahead of a race like charging for a OTT platform subscription. Note worth it now, back to Excel and calculators"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not opening on Android 14. I recently upgraded my phone and it is not opening."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be 5 stars, now unusable. The app is not unusable on the free version, can only put in a few expenses before it blocks my access for the day. Change please or we will change"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. So many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The nagging timer for non-pro users makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy App, disappointed after using for so long..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app used to be great, now it's not even remotely useful without an exorbitant subscription. Switching to tricount for now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Qual app vocês estão usando agora que o split wise não dá pra fazer muita coisa e está bem caro?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From a best to a worst app, it has ruined itself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new pay wall, you can now only add 3 expenses per day unless you go Pro. I've been using this app/website for years, but I'm now looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The biggest concern is, only 4 bills per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was working best but not now because its crashes since morning and its happening again and again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Installed splid for unlimited entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant app for tracking and dispensing group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app until a recent update which placed simple features behind the paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app experience and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited the amount of transactions I can add in one day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just horrible ! 3 entries a day only makes no sense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They literally have screwed up, from being amongst the best in the splitting space to the worst. Their new features just sucks. (You can add upto only three expenses a day) Are you kidding me? Literally moving me and 10 others to alternate applications."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Solamente 3 gastos por día la hace inusable y no tenemos economía para pagarla mensualmente en dólares."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to simplify payments splitting among friends. The free version is enough for casual use. No ads. Intuitive interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"muito pratico, recomendo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the new features that have been added under the free version - limiting expenses to only 2 per day and waiting 10 secs between each expenses. That is crazy. I had no issues with the app until this horrible update. Please fix this update back to what it was else will have to quit using this app. Who is going to pay a premium just to split a bill occasionally? Y'all need to rethink this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you kidding me that you want people to pay $50 per year to be able to split expenses now? Shove it dude. How ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using it from past 10 years.. Suddenly asking for paid version and stopping me to add expenses in between.. not trust worthy to data here anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling splitwise asking for payment to proceed!! Don't fall into fraud business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update forces a 10s cooldown between expense inputs, and limits users to only 4 inputs per day. This directly impacts long-term users who rely on the app's core function, without subscribing to a ""Pro"" plan. If it's critical, revising limits may be a fairer approach instead of fully disabling users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had been best, but 3 expenses a day, really bad move. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would someone pay 150rs/month if they need to use splitwise. If a group of 8 people uses splitwise they have to pay the 1020 rs for calculation of miscellaneous expenses!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update completely ruined the app, putting the most basic features behind a paywall. Find something else to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was very useful till the time it was allowing unlimited entries. Now with three entries per day has forced me to search for better app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Zero rating😒😒"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience with entry limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nobody is going to pay you there are so many good options available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update to limit the daily transactions of free users to only 3 transactions, and pushing them to buy PRO for that expensive price is nonsense. This app does not provide any feature that would worth that much money on a monthly basis. Increase the free daily transactions to 5 and lower the monthly fee to at least half."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for shared trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Downgrading the rating of the free app from 5 to 1 stars. After almost a decade being a a regular user, the new changes (limiting transactions to 3/4 per day) basically render the app useless for my use case"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using it for years I will be looking for a replacement app. The silly timer until you can add an expense was the last straw. The paid version costs twice what it should. I hope they go under as a company"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"la limitation du nombre de dépenses par jour, surtout à seulement 4, est une honte. C'est censé être une fonctionnalité de base qui ne révolutionne rien... La version gratuite est mal calibrée par rapport à l'abonnement PRO."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible update to limit transactions. If this is how you treat your users, they will leave. Make Pro better instead of the free version worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to pay for it when it wasn't limiting the entries But now, you just lost me by putting that as a premium feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full of ads and limited free functions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a very decent app, all the good features have now disappeared behind a very expensive paywall. Which means you either pay a lot for a good looking *and easy to use* excel file, or you have a completely useless free-to-use application. Would sadly no longer recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Irritating as it asks money for simple adding up split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Got complicated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now cant even add 3 expenses, before waiting a day to add more. Essentially unusable now without paying, which is simply too costly for the offered functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy if you need to split bills among a lot of people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent for group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app... Easy to track Money going IN & OUT.. 💵💰🙏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No stars for such a failure decision, just to lose all their happy users....the update is just souch annoying...sorry uninastlg it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's no more free to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you ever decide to go back to the model where I can add more than 3-4 transactions a day without paying, please let me know. Good luck!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable after its 3 day maximum expense limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new update, the free version of the app is next to useless. Unless you plan on purchasing their subscription I would use another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined credibility by restricting the entry"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was great until they started trying to force the app into a paid subscription for everything. Fine if you want the features, but if you wanna split more than, like, 2 expenses a day? Be prepared to pay up -_- sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm generally ok with some ads and even some waiting time. But if you don't relax a little on pushing the pro version we will look for another app to track our expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but the paid thing killed it for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic idea take all the hard work out of splitting finances between friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good before they introduced the limited-splits-per-day for the basic plan."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is good and i have been using the app for about last 10 years.. But the way they are pushing to subscribe for pro and limitting the daily number of expenses is so annoying and at the same time feeling betrayed.. Hence am checking for alternate option.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app worked great, I had several accounts with friends, but now it forces you to pay for a Pro subscription, it limits all functionality. They take advantage of the fact that our accounts already exist and limit their use. Do not use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day? You serious?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using for a while but now switched to paid model which is very expensive for what is offered and considering the alternatives. Will be a pain to switch but is what it is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying monthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good for basic use. I know developer needs to earn but I feel limiting no. of transactions per day is going too much. anyways regular usage doesn't need much of that too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use work great, changed the business model and made it less user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand that having to maintain the app has expenses. It's Okey to remove some feature like adding image. I can accept one time purchase for the app(may be some limited functionalities)... but limiting the number of daily expenses is totally unacceptable. once I settle up the expenses here I'll probably move to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a disgrace!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be amazing! Unlimited expenses and barley any ads, now its full of pro ads and now limits only transactions a day!! Its literally rendered the app unusable ?? And 40 pound a year ?? Who in the right mind finds that good value? Think its time to look eslewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed ruined the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I hope we can archive selected groups —settled up or not. I have several where people still owe me a little amount, but I'm no longer expecting they'll be paid since it's been years; but I also do not want to totally delete them, which is the only option given right now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible daily limit feature added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the experience instead of making the product better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are better ways to monetise your app. This is a joke now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update removed basic features. Do not download."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic app. Now you have a lot of waiting if you don't have the premium version..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great. They are now excessively pushing users to a paid only model to access even the most basic features. I never thought I would rate it this low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dear splitwise, make your app payment free but ad is still fine"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why not Shift to ad based revenue model? Like the other apps in the space. Have been using this app for almost 10 years now! But the transaction limits are driving me away to the competitors."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The only 3 bills/day has lost all your customers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Initially impressed, I quickly grew frustrated upon realizing the developer’s tactic: entice users with a few free transactions before imposing a hefty fee, effectively gating further access. This subscription model feels like a blatant cash grab, disregarding user experience for profit. Disappointed, I’m compelled to switch to a genuinely free alternative, as this approach is unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use although I am not sure how to delete an old group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's sad to have to write this. Their attempt to monetize is against their core value. You could use ads in a better way without hampering user experience. If it's easier for me to create a spreadsheet with built in formula to manage spend compared to waiting for your limits and pay walls to expire, then you've killed the product. Feel sorry for the people behind. You served us well, but i wish their was better way to monetize than bullying. I'd recommend trip based, daily pricing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Delay before adding expense is overkill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1.It allows other person to change the amount 2.Number of transcation per day is too much limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything useful behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app taking access of Phone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version now useless as can only do a few expenses per day and have to sit through add every time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"PRO too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy app for holidays. must use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a stupid app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a great way to share expenses. By pushing the Pro too much, they have introduced annoying features just to force users to use Pro, which has a monthly subscription fee, too mu h for me. There are other solutions that do not introduce these annoyances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years, including occasional pro subs to access specific functions when useful. It's been brilliant. The recent changes significantly limiting the functionality of the free version make it pretty much useless. I'll be moving to Tricount or another similar app as a result unless/until the changes are reversed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy motherfkrrs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"We have used Splitwise for 7 years, but after they made the free version unusable and the subscription is way too expensive, we switched to a different app. Fortunately the export from Splitwise is working in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use. no need for premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's taking lot time to load"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its no longer useful as a free option because of the new subscription changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only enter 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transaction per day is the worst thing they did against customer satisfaction. Uninstalling now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch paywall. 0/10."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Definitely recommend this app. It's super easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app, but daily transaction limit in free version is way too low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Maybe stop being greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What happened?! Used to be a great app. But now it's kinda useless. Definitely find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since long I have been using this app, but recent changes in this application forcing me to uninstall this app, why there is limit on daily entry, worst change ever, worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst app now! asking for payment everyday for splitwise pro! charging way too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywalled the heck out of it Trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was my favorite splitting app for almost 10 years! Now the free version became unusable. The value of Splitwise doesn't justify the pricing with so many free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horribe after setting 3 free entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is ruined with daily entry limit. Time to look for another application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice adjustment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty much useless after limiting expenses that can be put up in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New restrictions render the free version functionally useless. Farewell."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The updates make the app absolutely useless unless you pay for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for travelling with a few of you. particularly using different currency."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid app only allows 3 inputs and then limits you, completely pointless.w"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app,, life is soughted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"splitwise is great for groups. whether it is for a trip, ongoing expenses, etc...The only thing is when multiple people pay, it doesn't explain how balances are split up and it can get confusing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Self Destruction step!! Eventually it's all money game now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's been almost a decade am using splitwise. Good implemented thoughtfully. very handy managing expenses with frns or other groups either it's a trip or a loan or other personal expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Spammy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was the biggest fan. But the 3 transaction per day is just ludicrous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have added a timer in the latest update that makes you wait to put an expense on, trying to force you to pay. It's literally a waste of time, I'm finding another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, now it is unusable due to limits for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A limit of 4 expenses per day app wide is crazy.... Looking for other options or going to go back to Excel."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update has completely ruined it for me. This is not the correct monetization method. Will not recommend this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ads nightmare"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awasome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entries per day and wait for 24 Hours. Nobody gonna purchase the plan. Not needed anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate losing basic functionality in the name of subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using it for almost 5 years, but the recent update of limiting the transaction to 3 per day with 10sec add. Thanks, guys. I'll continue with the legacy way from now on !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing incorrect status in groups and friends and forcing people to buy pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great but now it's limiting the amount of expenses you can log on a day, so moving on to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I was introduced to this app to keep track of expenses paid as IOUs and I pretty like it. I don't have to worry and remember if I owe how much. Just use this app. 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. I use it for all my trips and tell me friends about it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit to 3 expenses per day. I will not pay for app that automates adding and dividing more than for Spotify or HBO XD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update is a pretty bad way to monetize. Limiting adding expenses to only 3 per day is absurdly low and the 10 second ads before adding each expense is super annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"There should be a feature of group people for a particular account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App gets really bad after they limit number of expenses user can add in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free usage is so less that it's barely useful The app literally says: Hogaya aadha hisab, ab kal aana 🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ad is annoying but fine. 4 expenses a day is ridiculous and makes the free app pointless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing app very easy for roommates to calculate the expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It feels like Splitwise is cheating to get us buy the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"755oe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. You have to pay even for basic things."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment for pro options is fine, but stopping the normal feature and forcing to make people buy, main reasons why mod apks are updated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to recommend this to friends. No more. Ads every time you add an expense and capping the number of expenses per day at 3? Disgusting. This was only mildly more convenient than Google sheets. Good bye you greedy fools."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best team to enjoy Hassel free transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making free features to paid. Good job. From the best app you are going to worst. From 4.6 rating to 3.5 ,you know something went horribly wrong."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. Lots of good features to keep the calculations simple. Would be great if it could read from receipts to further automate the process. Recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was perfectly functional until it started limiting the amount of expenses to add and added a 10 sec cooldown for just using the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now aftet 2-3 expenses it block and forces you to go for pro. This is ridiculous from split wise. I guess now its time to search other applications likewise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now bogus app..No use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for team dine outs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It asks me to upgrade my subscription to pro version to add the split details. I have added only couple lists. This is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to limit adding more than 4 transactions a day. They are clearly out of touch with how and why their users actually use the app. Everyone's going to find an alternative at some point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App ✨✨✨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads for entering expenses is terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now there's a limit to how many expenses you can add per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App generally works great, but they way that they're now trying to push a Pro subscription is super annoying. No longer being able to upload images, ok, there's a cost to that they need to cover. But having to wait for a timer to add expenses, are you kidding? Build new features we want to pay for, stop trying to make the app an annoyance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Can't delete group or change name of group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They limit expenses to 3 per day for free version, which is too small."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"USED TO use this once wonderful app. Splitwise became greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be so helpful for splitting expenses all day long. But now it has become inconvenient bcz only two splits are allowed in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Was tracking my expenses through manager app, but Spiltwise just tops all that app, Even tracking for spends with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much of ad is ruining the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst approach for revenue generation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of entries is super frustrating and annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente app, muy fácil de usar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really handy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making this a yearly paid service is just greedy. They should just have a lifetime one off payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was good until the recent update to limit the number of expenses that can be added per day to 3. Adios."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Do you really expect me to pay the same amount monthly as services like YouTube and Spotify (actual content platforms) to use basic what-used-to-be-free functionality on a calculator utility app? This app now limits you from adding expenses if you don't pay up. Garbage bait and switch tactics. Get all your friends to install and then they introduce a paywall for basic features. Don't fall for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Functionality is good but movement to put many features behind a paywall is short sighted. The real bummer is that as the person who set up the group, even if I pay the monthly fee it doesn't cascade to the individual users. I'm going to find another app for this function in the future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"sorted money problems in the best way.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really disgusted by the latest changes giving all that friction, forcing wait times and limiting the daily expenses. Really bad business model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool for managing trip expenses with a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires payment after 3 expenses are added in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is great, but too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid subscription model is unsustainable for this product. Free or one time purchase alternatives exist."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app after they monetized. Worst decision to kill customers. See ya"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app did not connect to my Venmo, so I lost $90. I got constantly locked out and the customer support was unhelpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't believe the basic functionality of this app which is splitting money is now a facility of a paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very third class app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's not letting me add multiple expenses and asking me to take pro subscription so I have reduced 3 Stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been a user for over 6 years and now they have added a limit to the number of expenses you can add per day. I'll be looking for an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's annoying to be restricted from adding expenses which is a basic functionality unlike other services provided by the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Suddenly changed and limited the number of entries under free version without any prior notification or heads-up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sucks that they charge a subscription now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paying $4.99 for this app evey month is rediculous. They may have to introduce lifetime fee or reduce the monthly cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If your app have only paid version then plz mentioned it why we wasted time space for your app.we have other options also"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made life easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the go-to app for managing group expenses, but greed got the best of them, and now they limit even the most basic functionality in the free version. It's not worth it now, look for other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great. But for a light user who used to input all group expenses every 3 weeks or so, the limit of 3 expenses per day and an ad for each expense are just ridiculous. The monthly cost doesn't justify the added value for me - I will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a meme of a decision to limit the free version so much. As it currently stands, this app is unusable unless you pay the yearly fee. A shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Screw the pro. Post ads if you need income. Don't limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Screw your limit on expenses. I ain't paying you for pro and uninstalling application right now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is going to die soon because of subscription reminder stupidity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't know why the app publisher become greedy. I had been a fan of splitwise as it was very user-friendly. But now they have allowed only 3 expense entries per day (that too with 10 secs ad in between) is just ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So I'm suppose to remember all the expenses for yesterday because now I number of expenses are districted. Way to kill your customers guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am an user since a long time but have planning to discontinue after the recent changes in the subscription model. The prices are too steep for the features offered."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The dialy limits on adding expenses and the annoying pop up when i try to add expenses is too much, monetization of the app shouldn't be on the the expense of the basic features of app. In the end this app is just a luxury not a necessity devs should understand that and there are many apps that provides the same functionality for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is buggy. Just click on add expense button and go back due to any reason, it counts that as entry made. And then without making any entry, you've hit the daily limit - whoa! - now go get a subscription! Splitwise is actually killing its customer base, by not introducing a proper revenue model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I wouldn't mine paying for the pro version. But too pricey for how much I use it. The free version now is impossible to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app aggressively pushes users towards its pro version, creating a frustrating experience for those seeking basic functionality without constant upselling. limited features in the free version diminish the overall user satisfaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good app but limit on transactions is disappointing..only 3-4 allowed in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They went from free and functional to $4/month, I'd have paid $5 for the entire app without subscription fees but not monthly for basically Excel with fancy font."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've gone way too aggressive trying to encourage people to get the Pro version. I was considering it until these changes but not anymore. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now they are pushing all users to go for pro option. Just 3-5 additions only per day. Looks for alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has very little use unless you pay for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid money for premium but hasn't been activated."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Its a nice app to split share the money between friends, roomates, groupies etc..have been using since 4 years...helps to reminded about debts with others.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Company became too money hungry. I understand any business would need money for its operations, but they went about monetising this app in the worst way they could have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely unusable in free version now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app specially for group travel. Have been using it for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor free version, also subscription charges are too high for Indian users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was the best app until the recent update of 3 entries per day in free version. Atleast that min free entry limit should be increased. Finding alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a way to destroy the app by introducing a limit on daily expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they are moving all features behind monetization. Time to move to alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you even have daily limit for adding expense......"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Zero if possible. Too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrific experience, timers before you can tap on things and extremely limited functionality with one expense per day. Plenty of other apps that do a much better job."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update this app became totally useless. I understand that creators want to persuade users to buy a subscription plan, but the way it was introduced after latest update is ridiculous. I am pretty sure there are other, less aggressive options to to this, please consider changing it in next updates otherwise I will have to find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be free but now you can only add 4 expenses without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Definetly the best app ever!!! I'd like to give it 10 stars!! EDIT: Now it's full of ads and with maximum daily expenses. This is not free anymore, don't recommend. I just unistalled and already got another similar app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's nothing more that I can say that hasn't already been said by the many years-long users who are now abandoning Splitwise due to their surprise exorbitant fees with absolutely zero notice from the developer. Zero stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was my go-to app before. They've made it impossible to use now. The minimum transaction limit is ridiculous, that too with separate 10 second ads in between EACH expense. Will be moving on to an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new split wise is horrible #boycottsplitwise Find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was excellent before. Now i have to delete it beocz of the worst new policies and limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst part is the dev of this app has become so greedy that he hasn't even reverted the change. This app was never designed to be turned into a paid app in the first place"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Daily limit makes the free version unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very thoughtful app. bowdown to the founders"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid Pro requirement! Deserve a 1 star for limiting the number of expenses. Waiting to switch to an alternative expense sharing app or using an older ver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The developers have become greedy lately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously used to be one of the best app but due to daily limit I've deleted the app and started using other free app which are providing the same setup. Downfall of great app begins."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adds ruines this app. It's unusable. STAY CLEAR. I'll just use Excel."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplifies expense tracking and splitting. Everything clear, everyone happy. Would love an in-app calculator when add8ng expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great application but adding restriction to basic stuff is rendering it not usefull. Giving free earlier and then putting restriction later is not fair. Allowing only 5 and for every entry keeping wait time is not fair"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App showing full of mistakes. Calculations are not correct."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app before but limited entry functionality is killing its use case in your mobile phone. Removing it today after long. Why would someone pay monthly subscription for easy splitting solution when many apps already available for free. The facility is not something we use very seldom."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!! App will only allow to enter 4 or less transaction a day unless we purchase the paid version. The app will DISPLAY ADS and still will allow only 4 transaction a day. There are BETTER APPS out there. NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD THIS. very disappointed with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"De 5 a 1. Era la mejora app para llevar cuentas. la usaba a diario. El hecho que te limiten tanto las funciones más básicas no tiene sentido. Espero recapaciten y vuelvan a su modelo anterior. Estuve tentado a comprar la versión pro pero el costo no me parece acorde."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a perfect app for settling trip expenses and keeping track of expenses within a couple, but recent changes have made it unusable. 4 expense per day limit and 10 second advert for Splitwise Pro to add any expense. Really dissapointing what Splitwise has done here, and I hope other customers speak out too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its Paid even for the very basic functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most stupid business move.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Add search 🔎 option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app works well to keep accounts of how much each person owes. I also find it useful to be able to share a list of groceries among everyone. I didn't give 5 stars because the paid feature of scanning receipts isn't very accurate and it's confusing to try and correct the things it got wrong. I resorted to manually adding things up with a calculator instead of using the scan receipt because it was so unreliable. It's such a good cool feature, it's too bad it doesn't work better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing us to use pro for basic features is bull***t. Will have to look for alternative after using it for years now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great easy tool to use and manage transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently become unusable due to heavy monetisation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I will no longer be using this app. They limited free entries to 4 a day which is ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a limit on daily expenses makes this app useless for group holidays etc, I'd rather ads but no expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The devs got too greedy. Putting a paywall for everything. 10 seconds to register an expense is ridiculous. And a maximum number of expenses per day was what convinced me to finally switch to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to remember who owes u what and what we owe them. I use the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier users are now limited by the number of expenses they can add per day. This makes the app pretty much unusual."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bad after recent update. too much restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new updates and paywall limitations this app has become unusable. I'll be moving to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is very restrictive and almost useless. The pro version is too expensive for this kind of app, is almost like a spotify or netflix montly subscription. I would pay for a one time purchase at this rate. I would search for an alternate app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's now an absurdly low limit of 4 entries per day! Will be switching to something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"update ruined this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice 👍 work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Maximum of four expenses per day is completely inhibitive. App is unworkable on the free tier now. And it's not as if there aren't countless alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day is the most aggressive and anti-user push to a paid tier implementation I've ever seen. Looking for alternatives now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version used to be fine with the occasional and for pro, but the recent changes have rendered the app so difficult to use. Will be swapping to a competitor app soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pay to use is kind of annoying, we have to wait very long to add splits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I see I'm not the only one being disappointed after using this app for years. Used to be great but more and more stuff is being paywalled, and decisions like having to wait 10 seconds and staring at the upgrade to pro button when tapping on ""add expense"" just makes me want to look for an alternative option to Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app. The daily expense limit is what changed my review from 5 stars to 1. I'll be looking for an alternative because it's not worth paying $40 per year for this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great until recently when they limited the expenses you can put in and the timer between adding expenses basically to force you to buy a subscription. As so many others I'll be looking for a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 entries per day in free tier ... without any announcement and no onetime payment option ... very disappointed ... will look for an alternative ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a really great way to divide and pay your expenses 👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Reduced the limit to add expense makes this useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very Annoying ad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do you realy think that people will take the yearly or monthly subscription to just add there expenses in a group or app. Think again before monetizing your services otherwise you will loose 80-90% customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No option to add advance payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like the app, I use it very often, it has easen up the process of bill splits when travelling. The only improvement I would suggest is to have an option to view all the recurrent expenses scheduled monthly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good and easy to use for storing all the payments and bills as a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's real good and only takes a short while to figure out. Reaaal niiiiiiiice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the BEST app if you do social activities as a group and share the costs. just download explore and experience the convenience of this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a user for years but the limit of 3 transactions per day makes this app pretty much useless? If they wanted to find a way to quickly destroy their user base. This is how. Definitely developers going ahead without any cx thoughts in mind.Not even an email notification? There's better pay models out there. This ain't it. Just make it a paid app and don't offer a free version if you want people to pay anyway. Update: Found a new app, split pal and have migrated everyone to there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As others have described, the move to the subscription based version has left a sour taste. Especially with no warning. Could've handled punishing through a few ads to keep using what was an excellent app but it's curtains for Splitwise for me, unfortunately"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing for group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for over 8 years. After their latest monetisation update, that sadly comes to an end now. They implemented a limit on how many entries you can make per day and have started added blocking screens that ask you to buy pro or wait 10 seconds to enter a transaction. I would gladly have paid a very fat one-time fee for this app considering how much it has helped me, but I cannot justify a €40 subscription. I will likely self-host Cospend on my Nextcloud instance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a totally bad idea to limit transaction bye bye app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please avoid this app. Do not support this company and their unacceptable business practices. There are free/cheaper alternatives that do the exact same thing as this app and you should use those instead. Limiting the amount of items you can add a day and bombarding us with popups makes the app useless to us. It's a shame too, I would be happy to pay to use this app even for the basic functionality (ideally a one-time fee), but asking $5/month is simply unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Entry limit sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only limited to 4 entries per day... then you have to upgrade to subscription based service. unusable app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled this one after found a better app which allows unlimited entries....."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good and useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you have Splitwise Premium. Absolutely 📉 of Splitwise. Who asks for premium for converting currency and pictures of bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"not that easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible after 2 transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled as u have pushed the daily cap to enter data. Shifting to Paytm. Im not gonna pay a penny for such a simple task like spliting bills. That too so much high. 10-20 rupees a month is Max that I will give for such a small usecase"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After this limitation it's very annoying to wait for next day while I have to keep note of the expense somewhere so that I don't forget to add it to splitwise next day. You guys should at least give 10 transaction per day for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically useless if not on pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never going to recommend this app to anyone from now. What kind of decision is 10sec waiting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to add more than a few expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you guys out of ur mind? Showing adds is fine but only 5expences can be added? Or buy premium? Premium for what? To split my bill? U guys have lost it... I am using this app for 10 years now.. but uninstalling it right away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"first time user, it's easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for paid subscription even for basic use. Not worth. Would be 5 stars earlier when free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a long term user and fan of splitwise free. While I appreciate the good work and the need to be paid for the work - this is not an app that is worth such a high price and that too for monthly subscription. You need to price this reasonably and sensibly to make this work. I'm not happy with your intrusive insistence and severely limiting factors incorporated into the app now. I'm looking for replacements or will get one created soon!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye bye Splitwise as you put the daily limit for adding the expenses so i switched to same kind of application it mean you forget that there is 100 application like Splitwise and if you do like this it means your customer can switch to other application as well in the end you will loose your customer like me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Initially, Splitwise was perfect – everything ran smoothly. However, the recent inclusion of ads, timed prompts for adding expenses, and a limit of 3 or 4 expenses per day has made it frustrating to use. It's disappointing to see these changes, and in my opinion, it has transformed from a great app to a subpar one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new paywall, nonstop ads, and limits to the number of transactions you can log per day have made this app painful to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I echo all the recent one-star reviews on the new, unreasonable monetization model. It was a great free app until the 3-transaction a day limit made the free version unuseable. I would have tolerated a lot of ads and data mining, but not the new price or restrictions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As others mentioned, used to be great, but horrible now with new free user daily transaction limit. Stay away unless you like paying a subscription fee for your basic apps..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you can only add 3 expenses without adds, then you have to wait for each expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be free, now you have a certain amount of entry per day, disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app to date I've found to sort out group expenses in an easy way"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Iam using Splitwise. But, With recent updat, It's blinking when clicked on Groups option. Unable to enter expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the 3 entry limit. I know you want to make money, but this isn't the way"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic functions should be free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Otherwise would have given 5 star for the help it has been, but the new monitosation policy and over proces monthly plan took it all down."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a convenient way to keep track of expenses with various groups. Several features were behind the paid version. The core functionality is simple but functional. The app has now moved to a largely unusable paid-only model which limits free users to tiny amounts. I would be willing to pay for better functionality or the service, but the monthly subscription model is expensive for the features. I will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced to wait to add an expense simply because I don't pay for pro, lol. Absolutely ridiculous. Uninstalling in a few moments. What a horrible app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If they don't fix this daily 3 limit thing in one month of this comment, I'll start making my own app. -- a software developer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Easy to split expenses with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise since a long time. Used to be one of the best apps but now they have put restriction on entering the expenses which is quite annoying. To get the full access, we need to take a subscription which is again too expensive. They should either reduce the subscription price or can include third party ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All but forcing the users to upgrade to a costly subscription model for the core functionality, probably not well thought out. Someone would have thought about the kind of backlash this monetization strategy would bring, no?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shittiest app ever was using it for some time with a group of friends it worked fine then it started bugging so bad no we have no idea who owes and who paid up and thw amount was getting quite considerable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be a useful app but now the dev has become greedy and only allows 3 entries a day for free which won't work for a lot of audience as there are other alternatives which are still useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now due to the the limits on expenses and pay wall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was an avid user before, and loved the app. Unfortunately, the new usage restrictions make the app practically useless and I'll have to find an alternative if this doesn't change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Found a better solution. Splitpal. Very convenient app than this greedy fellows. Used to be very good but now it's useless. Now I use Splitpal without any trouble."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"30jan2024: the app is forcing me to purchase Pro package, to add more than 3 expenses per day. Not Worthy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Earlier it was good. Now 3 transaction per day? Seriously? You are killing your users basically. Gonna uninstall soon. All the best."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new monetization method is pathetic and should be rolled back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very unethical practice of forcing the user to pay for even the basic services. End of an era for Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is unusable now now that its behind a paywall. This used to be a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates disappointed me, I am using this app since 1 year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is just worst. You can't add more than 5 expense in a day. And they have introduced ads in between expense. They are pushing the users for the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quite handy app. I use it regularly with my friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Pls allow add/edit only to the admin/creator of trip. Save sharing for all expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With recent updates, it became a useless app. Uninstalling. I understand that people must be paid for their work, but competition is competition. There are plenty of free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great now company's put everything behind a pay wall and app is more or less unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's useless now with the daily limitations and banner ad before another entry. Not worth a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I always loved this app... But the recent update has made the app from best to worst... Show ads on the app as sections but don't force users to buy pro and watch ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An excellent, easy-to-use application for monitoring and tracking group payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"everything is now paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Quando não tinha limite para cadastrar despesas era melhor. Arrumem outro jeito de monetizar. Dessa forma ficou inviável de usar o app. Vou procurar outro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed has taken over, realy bad move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became unusable in free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update just made the app unusable. Limited entries and ads while adding each expense is just too much. Having ads is understandable but making the app so annoying just to get money out of it is just a bad strategy..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app frequently. It was very useful and easy to use.(5 star ratings for your past performance) But., now it is very complicated and confusing. Calculations are also not correct. I won't recommend this to anyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until a daily limit for expenses was added. Now it's useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"That's how you spoil your customer experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edited from 5 stars to 1: It used to be one of the best apps out there but now they have a subscription model with such small limits per day, like only adding 5 expenses daily after a whole trip. I'm sorry but $40-60 a year to use your app now is too much. Literally one of the best apps out there. Makes money be the simplest part of my relationships."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great prior. But recent update kills the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. However they started to enshittify the user experience. Choose: pro ads with a wait or limit the number of expenses. But not both. I'm already looking into alternatives to migrate myself and my friends to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's just killing the customer base with the new update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not really great as the app is slow with less features. Earlier it was very user-friendly. I do not recommend this app to anyone as there are many free apps which are more efficient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Quitting Splitwise as pro version is expensive and free version has vey little to offer. I was a long time splitwise user. But now I'm switching after the aggressive pro model promotion. The basic version is unusable for a person like me. I paid for pro version before when it was 49 INR. But now 149 INR is too expensive. Please don't compare with competition. Be unique like splitwise was before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a 5 Star app before the daily limits. Pretty much useless on free version. I'll try other apps and see if it's worth paying pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paisa Paisa.. har jagah paisa chahiye inko.. jst uninstalling it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible business case to monetize the app in the manner it is currently. App is basically unusable now. Good luck with that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allows 4 daily expenses before I have to pay? No thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app.. 100% recommended..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't bother, Settle Up is the way to go now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but after they started limiting daily entries and introducing ads in between it became very frustrating to use the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be my go-to app for group travel expenses, but with limited entries per day, I've decided to shift to free alternatives instead. didn't mind the other paywalls but this was a dealbreaker"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 updates pee day and so many ads! Man I don't wanna add split wise subscription as another expense in the groups 🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing paid by limiting number of entries on free accounts. If it was a one time fee I'd have bought it. But this subscription service stuff is getting put of control. Not intetested in a company that operates like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update with expense limit makes it useless to share expenses in trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new version pretty much forcing you to buy pro is the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pricing is a joke. Charging 5-6 eur a month for something you don't need that often. There is daily limit of expenses you can add. I will be moving to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but daily limit of 3 transactions ruined it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great tool for sharing expenses in a group, can't recommend better app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable unless you subscribe to premium 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow! We used Split wise on a recent trip with 2 other couples. It was so easy to enter expenses as they were incurred to keep a running tally of who owed whom. There is also an option to separate out that sunscreen as a personal purchase without extra effort. It usually takes weeks to settle up on these trips. This time numbers were verified and checks written before we were on the plane home. The monthly fee is affordable and can be turned on and off as needed. Simple, functional & quick"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has become disappointing now. They must have cracked the correct revenue model early on"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wait times to add expenses until you buy Pro, limit on number of expenses you can add per day. Would rate 0 stars if it was an option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app for years. But introducing max 5 expanses daily if you don't buy premium is unacceptable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"muy útil en viajes y organizar los pagos en planes con amigos"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a brilliant app, and I didn't mind the occasional ad for the pro version. But the recent changes have rendered it borderline unusable, where you have to wait for an advert to finish before adding an expense, and they've massively reduced the number of expenses you can make in a day. I'll be switching to an alternative. Don't bother downloading."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Came here to update my rating from 4 stars to 1 star just because of its recent update. Been using splitwise from past 5.5 years. But downgrading to version 23.4.1 worked for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst Limited entry for users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great way to sort out payments for a Girls weekend away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Was good before, simple, all I needed. Now, basic features are behind a pay wall and I don't use it enough to justify paying for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and blocking entries with daily usage limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth to pay 40 pounds per year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's good but can they also add advance money tab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payments expire?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I've used it for 6 years and have had no complaints. Now the app has been updated to be barely functional unless you buy Pro. Limited transaction submissions per day, ads and timers before you can add a transaction... it's annoying as hell. Rather than wanting to pay for Pro and support the app, I'm more inclined to just stop using it and do this in a spreadsheet again. Pro used to give you new features, but now they just put the primary functions behind a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. But has become 'totally' unusable for free users. Subscription price is too high for such a basic bill splitting app. Greed can kill a wonderful app and how!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"These bastards are forcing to buy the pro version. There are limits to transactions you can add. This is just a basic split app and it should be completely free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's become useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sudden push to have users pay £40 per user per year for pro and also gutted basic functionality to mak the free version useless. Use excel, google sheets or pen and paper, it'll save you from this stupidity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are trying hard to sell their pro version and using cheap tactics."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"La app estaba buena. Hasta que agregaron los límites para la versión paga. 0/5"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For an app that used to be great, the way they have approached monetisation is completely unreasonable. Ridiculous yearly price"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had used Splitwise for the last couple of years. Now, there are both ads and a limit on daily transactions on the free version with a ridiculous subscription fee for the pro version. It's splitsville from Splitwise for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was an actual evangelist for this app, I probably got 20-30 people to use it because I was such a fan. Limiting the free experience in this manner is a really really stupid business idea. A 12 year old could re-code what the app does in a weekend and I guarantee this move is music to competitors' ears."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App now essentially unusable without premium which is far too expensive for what it does"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is so useful when travelling in groups!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App is good but friends are not... Don't use this with your friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They killed the app! Buying pro is now mandetory. One need to spend 5 USD/Month just to settle us expenses. No way! 5 USD/lifetime would be okay. There are better alternate with more features for the free users. Splitmyexpenses is one of them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rip off!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using it before it was Free, but now everytime asking for Pro Subscription not taking Entries of Expenses addition. Its not worthy to pay for Pro Subscription for such app. There are many Similar Apps on Play Store Free of cost, I Have Uninstalled it Now. Users are Recommended to go for other Alternative Apps (Freely available on Play Store), Not at all Requirement of Pro-Subscription of Splitwise. Really a Pathetic Decision for earning via Subscription Model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good. found it tricky changing from euros to gbp. otherwise really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Something is wrong with the payment for pro! We tried multiple times from different accounts too and the payment update did not reflect on the payment profilo or splitwise couldn't sync it! And of we don't update pro the app cannot be used. So basically we wasted one hour on our vacation figuring this out and went back to our old ways!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to uninstall the app as they have added a timer and make you compel for PRO subscription and it is annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been a fan of splitwise for years now, however the recent update pushing their customers to buy their pro version is just absurd. 3 entries per day with ad running the background is annoying. They should have kept atleast the basic features free and then maybe give add on features in their paid version. I'm sure they are going to lose their customer base soon if they continue this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used splitwise alot but recent change of 10 seconds wait is worse & greediness."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a great app, but the new payment model is crazy. Make it a once off paid app. I don't use splitwise enough to pay a monthly subscription. The subscription price is also ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Basic feature of adding expenses is limited and much more harder, and the application forces the user to buy the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes vacation with friends so easy to keep track of who owes who money!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, then they forced ads every time you put in an expense and also enforced an expense per day limit. 1* now and uninstalled. A lesson in greediness for them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad enhancements to limit entries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1. I need a spreadsheet to split trip expense 🫠 2. Install Splitwise 🤓 3. Oh sheet.. bullsheet..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they limit the expenses per day, this becomes a terrible app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"wonderful accounting tool. would def recommend. jus request the app makers to add more icons for variety of expense heads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Someone in the management knows how to kill user base.... Switching to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This rating reflects my unpleasant surprise towards the harsh restriction on the daily number of transactions. This app is no longer suitable for my use (recording expenses with travel companions). I also will not pay a subscription for something I use only occasionally."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This product has enshittified overnight with the introduction of a paywall after 3 transactions in one day. Fire your head of revenue product, they clearly don't know how to balance things like user satisfaction or retention."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be great, but they've recently decided to limit the number of expenses you can enter per day (4 per day max) without a 4$ a month subscription. Absolutely unacceptable to do break core functionality like this without warning and for a service that should cost a few cents a month to run at most. I'll be looking to switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a really good application up until they introduced splitwise pro and limited all their features even for users who have been using it for years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They recently changed their policy and do not allow more than 3 transactions daily on the free account. They did not handle the policy change well, they didn't even notify the users. With this change the app is almost unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a decent free app for managing group expenses, but now there's an ad before adding every expense and limit of 3 expenses per day which is ridiculous if you're using it during a vacation. Putting such a basic feature behind a recurring subscription simply kills the app for me. Would recommend using one of the many alternatives if you're not planning on purchasing pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After update now I can't add expenses to any of my group, it asks to get pro version with monthly or yearly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add more than 5 transactions per day anymore if you dont have a premium subscription. Pathetic!!! Moreover after each expense added you have to watch adds before adding another one. Have become such an unpleasant experience with splitwise. Time to find a new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable after new update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise since years and have recommended this to so many people. But the recent update has killed the main feature. How can an expense app restrict expense entries, absolutely ridiculous. If spliwise don't want to lose the customer base they need to bring back free expenses entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for 10 years and it is now totally useless after their recent update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was fantastic until they changed, without warning, to a subscription model. It is now essentially unusable unless you dole out a hefty annual fee for each user. Awful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pro feature is not working, charts doesn't show up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update has killed this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great option for friend/family trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Less hassle in computing our expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even have a calculator. Garbage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor marketing strategy bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"much advertising to buy premier otherwise it's good beneficial"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid update, uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now that they limited the free access, soon they are gonna go downhill. Don't worry some other app is gonna offer something better. Good luck splitwise team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses per day with the latest update. That's the stupidest thing I ever saw. Me and all my roomates will switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise for years but it's useless without paying for Pro now. It's not such a necessity in my life that I need to pay for it. Back to excel for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using Splitwise for 4 years and now you ask me buy a subscription to post and manage my expenses? Hahaha great business model. F u and your business model 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and I have been a long time user. I frequently recommended it but the new paywall makes the app unusable without costs that are unreasonable for the tool that is being offered. Huge bummer. I will be finding an alternative ASAP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to see where money was spent and calculates all the even shares of things."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing for tracking group expenses, takes the awkwardness out of asking people to pay you back"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has entered their enshittification stage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent, simple way to keep tabs on spending and settle up at the end"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is straightforward and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be great but the sudden restriction to only 3 items/day makes this unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, have been using it for a while now :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit is a terrible limitation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but they have turned greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app for roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App freezes, can't join group, won't sign me up, horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable on the free account and not worth the subscription price. Will have to uninstall unfortunately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money? . No thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Y'all ruined it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update with Subscription fees is very disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses on free version. What a waste."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit to 3 entries per day! This is absurd! Will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant way to manage group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"$5 a month is an absurd price for this. It was convenient when it was free, it's absolutely not worth $5 a month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Anything useful is now behind a pay wall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great way to track group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't understand what goes through the minds of devs when they pull stunts like this. I can think of a 100 better ways to monetize an app. ""Our app is mostly used by broke college students. How do we monetize the app you ask. $40 a year, yeah that should be right and let's take away adding expenses as a feature to make sure everyone buys our subscription. This is the only way to monetize"". After 10 years of using the app I would have paid a one time or even a small subscription. Good riddance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I used this app back in dec 2023 and this app is super useful it can do all hefty calculation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max number of 3 entries per day without subscription. Was a loyal user before, and I am going to uninstall it just now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made unusable by adds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free app is too restrictive and the monthly subscription charge is too high for an app like Splitwise. Need to look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full add's Worst to use nowadays. There are many other apps with same features, I say use them then this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the best of the best of the rest!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for a long time and it was great, until the developer's greed kicked in. Now, there is a daily entry limit and ads kick in wanting you to upgrade to Pro, that you cannot skip for 10 seconds. Their asking price is much too expensive for this type of app. I understand wanting to cash in on hard work, but $0.99/mo, $9.99/yr, or maybe a one time $29.99 fee would be much more reasonable and likely would've been an instant upgrade for me. But now, I'll be looking for a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined the app with an effort to get more money by wanting you to upgrade to pro. The app is convenient, but not worth spending money on when you can use Google sheets for free. Sad that you can't even put in an expense without seeing an ad or being limited in the expenses you can ad Would not recommend since all they want is your money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To add an expense .. play an add for 10secs.. there are so many free apps that comes with better visualisations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, now you have to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Yrr 1000rs. toh jyda mang rhe ho. Ye koi tarika hai bhik magne ka. Itna toh hotstar nhi mangta."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is worser after limiting the functionality of adding expenses in recent updates. Dude don't kill your customer base. You're doing great you can invest the ""Pro"" feature functionality in other in-app elements instead implementing it on adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since a recent update, the most basic feature of the app (recording expenses) is locked behind a recurring paywall! Only 3 or so expenses can be added per day now, which makes the app unusable without paying - there's plenty of good free alternatives by now, good bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expenses entry limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy devs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ""Settle up"" app is much better. Splitwise was a great app ,but now, with all of the ads and subscriptions, it is not. if It was one payment, I would consider it, but now I just need to find a better one 🤡. I should I pay when you have all other apps that are better and FREE. :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app to split the cost of stuff with no fuss. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Interesting app for Group tour"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grabbing new features make app unusable. I'll now be using Monzos free features which are much better and actually useable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You want to monetize. That's fine. This wasn't the way to do it. Your app wasn't sticky enough for people to feel compelled to subscribe. Your app also wasn't revolutionary enough not to be copied. Someone didn't do their user research, analytics, or testing. And, despite the negative reviews, hasn't done anything to hold onto their user base. Honestly, piss poor work. Notice I've used the past tense. Splitwise is no longer an app I'll use, as it no longer meets my needs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Highly recommended EDIT -- lots of ads... Uninstalling.. don't install"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great payment management app especially for roommate bill splitting or friend groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"absolutely love this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good. Easy to use. Would recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome app for keeping track of shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute stupid update to put a limit on adding expenses .......I understand ads to keep the app free but how can you literally kill the only one thing that's the app meant to do ....never using it again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowed to add a few expenses a day and have to pay their foolish membership to add a couple more expenses. Tricount much better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for years to track group expenses on trips, only to find that the free version has suddenly been made much less usable now with daily limits and countdown times between adding expenses. I understand the need to monetize, but this app is great for sporadic large groups and there is no way you're going to convince a group of people to pay a monthly fee just to split the occasional bill. Unfortunately will have to find a replacement tool now unless a change is made."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It was an awesome way to keep costs tracked during a group trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for splitting the bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bekar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Same as other reviews. I've been using this for years and now we can only make 4 entries? In fact, I just made 2 entries and it already maxed out the entries? Maybe cause I edited some previous entries? The cost to upgrade to pro is quite extreme too. Maybe a $1 or $2 per mo would be fine, but $40 is a bit much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't see my own line items of what I paid. I only see what borrowed. I have no way of knowing if I entered all my expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Work on you app. I can make a better app than this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Every new version is a downgrade to free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"By far my experience is good with splitwise. I have a suggestion for you guys can you please add some kind of description like field in groups that would be great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To get the full review, you'll need to wait 10 seconds for a an ad to load. Changes made are a huge step back, avoid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore since the new paywall - you can only upload 3 expenses per day with the free version. There are plenty of free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are fine but to limit the number of expenses per day, that's too low."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates severely limit daily transactions (3/day) and impose an obnoxious 10-second waiting before being able to input expenses, all to push their overpriced Pro subscription on you. Alienating the user base is a terrible monetisation strategy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic app. They've put up a paywall that makes it almost unusable. I assume they got purchased and or something and now they just want to squeeze users for cash. Really only a matter of time before someone comes along and makes a new ad supported version of this that doesn't suck"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously you could add any amount of expenses, now they have a Pro version that unlocks this BASIC feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally confusing not helpful at all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go-to app for sorting out trip expenses with friends. Now, they added a $50/year subscription to use the app. I would have paid a one-time price for the whole app, but adding a subscription is just being greedy. There are many amazing free options, don't bother with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used Splitwise for years with no issues. Now it's basically useless until you upgrade to the Pro version. Super disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why did I have to pay for more splits... Stupid. Free options available elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It used to be great. With the push of features towards Premium only, I have switched to Tricount. The most annoying one is the limited number of transactions you can add within a day with a free account. Definitely too low for trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This pushing to get pro version is annoying. I used to use this app frequently, but now I can not add more than 3 expe ses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is no longer useful without premium. Not at all a good way to force customers to purchase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transaction daily limit? I am sure there are alternatives!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless app now - only let's u only add 3 expenses per day + makes u wait with a timer. talk about forceful adoption to splitwise pro. plenty of other free apps available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Long time user of splitwise. Excellent until latest update. New update introduces a paywall/subscription for basic features (limits number of expenses per day, 10 second wait time to input expenses etc). Unfortunately, the new update and subscription is a deal breaker for me and I will be moving to an alternative app and deleting splitwise. Thanks to a formerly great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update now limits your expenses to 3/day. Won't be using this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"love it before payment limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New version only allows to save 4 expenses a day. It isn't useful anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update rendered this app useless. Free features are worthless. Not willing to shell out so much for basic features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I cannot pass not a human verfication"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money deducted and subscription not provided for Splitwise pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good but now they've restricted the amount of expenses you can add in a day and adds every time you try to add an expense. Have deleted add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad ...pushing to paid pro app. I am deleting this app. Don't use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent limited features is too unfair for non-premium users who have depended on this app for a long time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is too limited and pro version is too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"an excellent app. perfect for those crowded vacations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Moving previously free features behind the subscription wall is a lousy developer approach :/ (I'm talking 10s waiting time and 3+ entries per day)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They put a daily maximum which is only around 5 and spam that you buy the premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst in OnePlus"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses per day? Really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the recent changes, Splitwise is unusable without a subscription. You have to watch an ad before adding every transaction and with a max of the transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add up to 4 expenses a day. Just make an also FREE but not capped Google Sheet to track expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"convenient and easy to use interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise pro ruined the app. Not longer viable to use for trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like another reviewers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great. Now it is just a money grab with a very expensive subscription system. Not impressed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bye, you've ruined this great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great, but why are they now forcing a subscription? The app creators are super dump. This app can be easily replicated, and now there are many excellent alternatives available. Why lose your market!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's getting very annoying with ads. To the extent that you can barely use the app anymore. Tricount or Splid are better and we are uninstalling Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really great app but all the ads make it almost useless. There's a maximum of 3 expenses a day when you're not a premium member and ads in between adding each expense. $5 feels excessive for an app that is not used daily but rather only on occasion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's now become useless without Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too bad. Lots if way to make money out of this app instead they chose to do it in worst way possible. Cant add more than few expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit makes the app not usable anymore for free tier users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Outrageous that you are asking 5 dollars a month for something that was free for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was the great before they implemented the new restrictions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thanks team for creating this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible that they're ruining an extremely helpful and useful app by limiting transactions and implementing wait times. Guess I'll go back to using my spreadsheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One Star for the new update. You guys forced to only make 4 entries in adding expenses, if the splitwise premium is not taken. I will see for some time. If not removed, will uninstall the app from. Guys, please be aware that, people won't pay 999 per year just for calculations. Please keep it as before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good when there was no limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't believe you can only add 3x expenses per day since the last app update. This is so so so unrealistic. I had previously used the app for years without any issues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing daily limits is a di ck move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses a day may be the stupidest business model to attempt to get people to buy pro I've ever seen. Will delete and not recommend to anyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be alright and pretty useful. But now its useless unless you want to pay for the pro version :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thank you for the service. But now we switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free user limits, forcing to buy monthly/yearly subscription for expenses tracker is too much. Instead show ads in case free user or ask for one time payment. I feel Google spreadsheet is better now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was free to use until now, I had a good few years using the app for anything budgeting. Now you can register max 4 expenses per day. Ridiculous, will migrate to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic paywall introduced for something this basic!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was annoyed with the ads but I could understand that it would generate revenue. Although, the change to limit users to add expenses was a really poor move and made me uninstall the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The new ads and limited entries feature has ruined the experience. Will be moving to a new app soon enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I really like the app, it is very useful and intuitive. it would be 5 stars if it would be possible to combine all the currency without additional payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is dead. Was using this for friends to keep track of dinner payments and stuff. I ain't paying a subscription for that. There's plenty of alternatives. I'd rather use pen and paper than to pay for this overpriced app. I dont need all the fancy graphs and other nonsense. Lemme buy the app for 5 bucks with basic functionality and be done with it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless now that you can only put in 3 receipts per day. Switching to Tricount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you have been good app, but after limit tranaction , i am switching to other app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty pointless in the free tier after recent update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Please go back to your previous model. Stop the ads. I've already switched to Splitkaro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: Jan 2024. Many of us grew up living with roommates and friends, and using this app has helped all of us in so many ways in the last 5-8 years, but not anymore due to its restrictions of adding expenses. That's sad. There should have been a better way to monetize it. Splitwise will take the hit while users moving away to other options. Changing to 1 star. Anyway thanks Splitwise. The must app who share their expenses. Awesome. Good part is it's available on web and mobile; the advantage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to simplify the expenses in group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tumhe paisa chahiye? Ye lo paisa"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes are just horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used tk be a great app but now I suddenly have a limit of expenses I can add every day... Think I'm going to convince my friends to download another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't strip features from an app you've built. Either get new features or just stop advertising the free-ness. Don't make it incredibly difficult to do anything as a free user and still claim it's a free app. Horrible management decisions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app before their GREED took over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for these many days. Now it is asking for subscription to add expenses. There are lot of free apps. So uninstalling this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent paywall implemented breaks functionality for me. Only download if you are willing to pay the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limites de adição diária de despesas irrisórios. Acabaram com esse excelente app. 💔😭"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They made us pay for things that are free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too expensive to subscribe to and too limiting to reliably use in free version. Would happily pay a small once-off fee, but subscription rates are exorbitant."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless as a free app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a fantastic app once upon a time but you can only add a tiny few charges a day which makes it unworkable as a free edition. So overall avoid this like Covid-19, its a moneygrabbing app and you can use free alternatives off Google Play."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the newest update you have to wait to insert your expenses for 8!!! seconds.. after adding some it won't be possible anymore for this day. I was a big fan of the app, but now.. can't recommend it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 3 expenses a day without warning. Ad supported or something like that would've been fine for free users. Sounds like you couldn't sell the data, so you need to monetize to get acquired. Poor leadership move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free, but requires payment now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app! makes life so much easier in terms of keeping track of bills, payments and other expenses! highly recommend to everyone!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not possible to add more than 3 costs per day unless you pay for the premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - have been using it for years and suddenly am facing a payment barrier. Terrible business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Devs are greedy as f. Paywalls are everywhere, they just ask money for everything and it's crazy amount of money. Just try to revert your version or find another app. F u to whom may concern, hope this greed make you come to an end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for absurd pricing Edit: Moved to Splitkaro app. Amazing UI better than Splitwise. No ads! No bs!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Big mistake in my opinion. Rather than try and find useful features to sell to pro users the devs have purposefully made the free version less convenient. For that reason alone I've lost respect for the devs. To offer new features and great additional service to a paying customer who opts in is appropriate. To take away something that was provided for free previously, real slimmy. Would be 1 star but I can't deny that app was useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The service this app provides is very basic as compared to the price it is charging, not worth the price"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for 5-6 years , and loved it. Now they are trying to monetize this by limiting daily transactions limit for 3 or 4 , most people may not average 3-4 transactions per day but there may be a day in a week when they end up with 4 -5 transactions. Also $40 per year subscription model is unreasonable. For their own sake something like $1 per month is more reasonable, otherwise we will go somewhere else. Adios Splitwise so long"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is great for trips I've had with friends and family. It makes it so much easier for everyone to throw in expenses as the go and not worry about saving notes and coordinating later. I especially like the option to change how to split the charge as it gives you all kinds of options. App works well and never had any issues at all. Really recommend especially for anyone who used to be the excel sheet maintainer for big trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Phonpe wala option add kro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be fantastic. I have been using it for years, and have loved it. Now the limitations are unreasonable. The daily limit either used to be high or unlimited(I do not know for sure, either way, it was not a problem). A month ago I noticed it went to 5, which is insane. Today, I was greeted with a limit of TWO daily entries. This is ridiculous, thank you for the export feature, I'm going back to Google sheets and then making my own app. Good job running your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and absolutely loved it. Then you had to get greedy and change it. I'd get a free daily limit of 10-15, maybe. You changed it to 5??? Now it's 2???? Yeah, no thanks. I'm moving to Google Sheets. Congratulations on butchering your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great and a bunch of features for free. Now they're really cracking down on people who have used this service for free and limiting expenses etc. Scummy behavior because now we can't switch as we are still in the middle of calculating expenses 😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had used this app lot of times but recently on a trip, I used this again and realised that they have expense entry limit for a day unless you subscribe to their premium plans. They could have kept adding expense and basic bill split free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When the developer/management gets greedy, this is what you get"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why did you return the limited register per day again?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version has become unstable now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful app when travelling with buddies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bruh what was that recent update? app went from 100 to 0 real quick"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!Easy to manage expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This new limitation just KILLED this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version limit is too small. Better to remove free and make it completely pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used Splitwise for years and have been paying for Pro since 2019. My friends who aren't paying for Pro can't enter expenses anymore due to your new absurd rate limiting. So instead of getting them to pay for Pro, you've now lost me as a customer instead - there's no way I'll support your blackmail."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You built an app that divides numbers by 2 and then adds them together. It's not rocket science. Why would you introduce a limit to the daily expenses to make people pay up. It makes no sense, there are 500 alternatives, you can literally build your own in a day. So no, I am not getting SplITwiSE pRO, I'll just uninstall the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"seems to have issues that have gone unfixed for those on the android os (eg to adjust an unequal split). Hope this gets picked up and rectified soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid app, can't add more than 3 transactions/day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely aggressive free tier with only 3 daily expenses available, making it pretty unusable. Such a shame. Used to really love this app. Will be switching to another."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too mannnny ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much for subscription. One time purchase would be justified."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhai ab Iske ka premiun le.!🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ad in basics features waah…..…"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using split wise from 2015-2016 but planning to stop using this application due to recent changes. Now there's a daily limit for adding expenses that too with added advertisements. Just ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise's recent update is exactly how a brand can kill off its customer base. I've long used Splitwise, and recommended it to many, but the limited daily entries (and the annoying long ads in between) have made it unusable. I understand that companies need to monetise their offerings for revenue. But doing so at the expense of basic features is a decision that'll cost them many users. I'll suggest at least including 10 daily entries and the basic functionalities in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately Splitwise had to monetize so now limited to 4 entries a day. So it's kinda useless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only useful if you pay for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to deal with sharing expenses with friends, either for trips, at home etc. Love it's UI, ease of navigation, managing multiple groups and simplifying shares."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is only useful with pro. Without pro, you are limited to two expenses per day, making it basically useless. Pro version requires ongoing subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ad is coming which is annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Did they really think limiting 3 expenses per day was going to help retain users? I don't mind paying for more features. Or like every other app, I'm okay with other 3rd party ads as well. Split wise doesn't have a monopoly on this product. It's an easy switch for me simply because there are apps doing the same thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This has become a worst app with tons of restrictions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Just make us watch ads to monetize. Your users are most likely frugal like myself. Enforcing us to buy premium by limiting non-premium users to only a handful of transactions per day is not the way. It's been a great ride, but all good things must come to an end I guess. I'll leave 3 stars since I cherish what you used to be. Adios 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"need to have options to UPI gateways to clear or settle amount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great option really. makes your life so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"now you can add only 4 expenses within a day in free version. another good app destroyed, hope the managers are proud."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand that the developer needs to monetize the app, but taking the basic functionality away is a new low."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ghatiya policy hai Why to pay 999 per year for the premium subscription This is way more than expected It should have been 199 per month Developer bhaiya koi nahi lega... Kamana hi tha toh soch ke badhatey... Dhero app hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you add a timer to your app? It's unnecessarily long and just another money grab. You had a good app that I was happy enough to purchase for when I went on holidays or big trips. Because of this, I looked elsewhere and found Monzo does the same thing. So now, why would I use this at all? Shot yourself in the foot there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes for limiting the transaction to 3/day is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm with everyone else. Restrict extra features and have ads, but don't make me wait in between expenses. I will be researching other options immediately. I would also happily pay for a lifetime subscription if they had offered and I think many people would."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become worse after decreasing the limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a stupid monetization strategy, only 4 expenses per day and 2 of 4 are 10 second delays to force me to upgrade? It's not like splitwise is the only app out there for this. Used to use this all the time, but switching to Tricount now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app makes you only angry and brings complications to your life. It gives you the taste of what the paid version is like and starts slowly taking it from you once you're already dependable on it. Paid version is great i guess. Too complicated ui never the less."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For managing group expenses, eg for a trip, this application is extremely useful. Function - wise it's impeccable. Edit: well that turned bad unexpectedly... Now that I use it, after adding 3-4 entries I was treated with a nice message saying I reached my max expenses for a day and forcing me to buy premium.. That's a terrible practice. So use another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"awful. Used to be a great app, the daily limit totally killed it. Would have been more appropriate to gave some ads for free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit on adding expenses, and the ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What should be a brain-dead simple tool is so stupid. Add a person to the group and somehow he's not part of the split of the stuff you already entered. Because it can't handle filling in expenses after the event?? Anyway, just installed because the group wanted to use splitwise, will uninstall as soon as I can... JFC"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"money hungry subscription model with 4 payment per day for free users. switching to any other alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience presently"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limits per day ruined the experience for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand the need for monetization I really do. But this is the worst way to go about it. Just place an ad at the bottom or add an ad after every 5-10 entries. Make premium ad free. It's so unbelievably stupid to limit entries. I'm going for alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introducing a monthly fee and limiting expenses??? What a way to ruin an already functional app. Guess ill go ask chatgpt to keep my tabs and expenses FOR FREE."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding limit to number of expanse you do per day is most stupid thing they have done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app until Splitwise Pro was required for things. The popup ads and expense limits are going to force me to find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If there's one thing I don't want to do, it's pay for the ability to keep track of payments to someone else. Why do people always have to take a useful app and, instead of offering added utility for a fee, they just hold ransom formerly free tools and demand a fee for them like highway robbers? What a sleazy decision. Shows a lot about the integrity of the organization as a whole. Gross."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it was good, now not worth to use with the new update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Implemented a pay wall without warning limiting users to 3 expenses per day unless they subscribe and pay. App is worthless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App started money grabbing (""you have added too many expenses for today"" after 3-4 transactions recorded)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great way to share cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Disappointing new pricing model and paywall - like most other reviewers, I'd pay a nominal sum for this useful app but not a £30+ subscription! I won't delete it yet in the hope that Splitwise will heed these comments and reconsider their approach. Will move back to a simple Google Sheet if they don't, however. Have awarded it 2 stars as I've had good use out of it for a year or so now and would have been happy to pay a modest sum to keep it - but not this kind of money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What money grab joke, making as pay by limiting the expenses we can add in a day to 2"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added limited addition of expenses...? Not gonna use it anymore. Thanks for your services."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use it and it was great but the app became useless with the last update. Don't waste your time downloading it, you'll have to pay an expensive subscription to use basic functions that any other app would give you for free. Ridiculous!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless app. made me select tiles on atleast 20 images for resetting password and even after that it kept popping new images. Please avoid such a useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It starts forcing me to buy splitwise pro after adding few of the expenses saying if you want to add more expenses then buy splitwise pro...they should have told that before we even started using this app....when we are halfway there then they do this witty but so cheap trick"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app asking for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is too restrictive without the ""Pro"" version. A least there were no upsells or ads in delete account flow. 2 stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes trips easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit if 3 expenses a day is totally unacceptable. The subscription is too expensive for its limited use cases. Will look for alternatives after this trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good till recently, suddenly they want every one to pay Rs 1000 every year, only 4 transactions per day allowed in free version.. Don't see much value now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great while it lasted. Goodbye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Chtiyapa"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unfortunatly I had to revise my 5 star review from back in 2015. I've used and recommended this app since its early days, but recent changes are disappointing. The new daily limit on expenses and mandatory subscription for basic functionalities are restrictive. Consider a one-time fee or lifetime subscription instead. Many of us, including a large user community I brought in, are reluctantly looking for alternatives due to these limitations. Please rethink these changes to retain your loyal user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like many people in the reviews, I am an old user of this app and I love the way it simplifies the splitting and tracking of the expenses. Recently, they have restricted the users from adding more than four expenses per day if we don't purchase the pro version of the app. Very bad decision IMO."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nonpoint to use this as only 3 entries a day allowed!!! Useless with entry limits..even 1000 bucks for a year pro is a ripoff"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced a very low limit (2-4 approximately) on how many expenses per day you can enter per day in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So many restrictions if app is not paid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing, easy to use and so helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was excellent. Now they try to force buying the new subscription by limiting number entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Soon to be dead app. Free version is limited and pretty much useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for sharing expenses. I am using since it was named bill monk :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They're so many ways to monetize and you guys picked the worst one possible, uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I absolutely loved this app and would use it to help with finances in a share home or making outings with friends and family easy. I will know be on a war path to make sure ethis app is never downloaded again. Putting your expenses behind a time paywall is disgusting behaviour and you should never make a single dollar. Rubbish business. You should be ashamed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was amazing but looking for other solutions with the daily expense limit. not worth the price point for pro as a subscription for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app but now it's filled with ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used the app for a couple of years and it worked well for splitting expenses on trips especially. The change to only a couple expenses/day unless you subscribe made me write this review and uninstall the app. I would have payed a one time fee to support the developers but will now use something else instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years, and the new limited transaction update has made me swap off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously this was my goto app for all expenses, but after the pro version (which is too expensive), it has become completely unusable. The free version is limited to 4 expenses per day which is very less, and it also has 10 second waits. It's time to switch apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions a day is a joke. I don't enter transactions daily, so I literally can't use this software anymore. Uninstalled and deleted my account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best apps until they introduced the paid tier limiting regular users to 3/4 expense entries per day. Now it's garbage, even to add the free entries there is a 10 second ad delay. Not worth downloading."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is now going down, after they have started showing adv, that was still fine now restricting to add expenses 😡😡😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy company and you have just dug your own grave. You could have just added ads if you wanted to mint some money out of the user. But stopping from adding more than 5 expenseses will drive people away..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't install only 4 expenses you can add to more asking to take subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's convenient for group travel, group daily expenses tracking. Just that it needs Pro subscription to get the full function & add more expenses per day. Overall it's good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Love the app. It became way too expensive. I'm outta here!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Four people traveled together for a week & took turns paying for dinners, accommodation, groceries, taxis, you name it! And at the end of the trip there were a couple of etransfers to settle up but were minimal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they silently removed the ability to add receipts/photos to expense entries without paying for Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, does all the things you need for enjoying a trip with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was really good before the latest update. After adding the daily limit, it becomes the worst app. Really disappointed with this change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are evolving. Just backwards."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a convenient app in the past but now they are charging a subscription so it's just not worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do you need to pay subscription fee just add expenses? This was my go-to app with regards expense tracking since 2018."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Grim. Recommended by a friend, looked great, started doing a multi-person holiday on it, and almost immediately ran into the stupidity of having to wait a few seconds before you put anything in, and only being allowed to put three things in before it stops on you. That makes it useless - little above the level of an IT scam."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They introduced a maximum number of entries in the free version. Use another cost sharing app instead of this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dissapointing that there's a limit on the amount of expenses you can put in, for more than 4 expenses per day you have to buy premium for 30€/y. For a calculator? No thanks. Fixed it by uninstalling and manually installing older APK (23.6.1). Also UI is not the clearest, took me a while to figure out how to add people to existing expenses (you can't add them from the list anymore, you have to type in their name)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for more than 5yrs now but unfortunately the recent limitations, and ads in free version will force me not to use this app anymore. 💔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic ad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really handy for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 3 max per day ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth your time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Having to pay for attaching a receipt is a pain in the posterior. Not being able to pay through the app is just unforgivable. It's a good idea, but a waste of time and effort as it doesn't make life any easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Goodbye freeware"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling due to the new limitations in adding expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great idea, but I had 3 sync errors in just 20 transactions. The only solution was to delete and redo the transactions (which uses up the number of your daily free transactions). Annoying behaviour and I would have expected better from such an app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become freemium the worst possible way. Time to migrate to other apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free expense limit is 3, but my app only allows two."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to only 3 transactions per day is outrageous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was great before, but now with the recent update on the free version you can only add a (very) limited amount of expenses per day, like 5 or 10? just rubbish."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App.. I used it in my all group travel .. easy share no need for collecting cash from each members .. the App is user friendly and give reminder too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update takes away its sole use, allows limited transactions and says you can't add transactions beyond a limit. No point using this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Predatory lock in"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"And this is how you break something nice. Free version is now basically useless with the limited expenses. Moving my accounting to another service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You don't have complex enough product to charge fees."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update made it unable to use the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent for trips and handling roommate shared payments. I joined before splitwise pro started being enforced. I'm debating on leaving because I don't want a subscription, I'd rather pay a one time fee to use the app for the basic features. I'm looking around for equivalents because of the restrictions made enforcing a subscription splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app after update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One of the best of its time, used it for many years. Now the worst of all. Ads every 2 seconds, can't add more than 5expenses in a day if you are not a paid user. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to have more free features, now they even restrict how many expenses you can add in a day when free. Ridiculously expensive for being a mildly more convenient spread sheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been a super useful app for years now, but recently started limiting what you can do with the app in order to force people into paying for a premium subscription. They can take those awful business practices and shove them somewhere the sun never shines. I'm now looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until they introduced the limit for free version, simple bill split use cases don't need the paid version. Such a sad decision by splitwise. Will be going for alternatives now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So great for group expenses on trips and useful too. Saves so much time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not working properly it's not showing group which I have been added and providing notification for the same group.not worth using you can see alternative for the same."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible way to force people for a pro version.... guess what, my friends and I are switching to one of many substitute apps available!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for group finances. Free version works perfectly. Planning to support the devs in the future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing but sjnce last ypdate you need to watch an ad to add an expense. Ridicolous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started charging for features that were previously free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limits basic features, predatory subscription model and dark patterns"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the cam!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage expenses with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be good but they ruined it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shows ads for adding transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a great, simple app to balance/combine group expenses. Now they want to make me subscribe for basic features like adding more than 4 expenses in a single day. I get that apps need to make money, but this isn't the way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it's impossible to add expenses without watching ads, and I can't add more than 4 expenses per day. It used to be a great app, but now it's unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be cool but now the free version doesn't allow more than 3 expenses PER DAY. That's messed up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent change made the App experience terrible with ads and limitations. I not willing to become a paid user, so I'll need to find an alternative App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely ruined the unpaid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Liked the app but now in the free version you not able to add more than 3 expenses a day and watch advertisement before evry entry i would highly recommend to switch to a diffrent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sudden push to move to a paid subscription for a ""Pro"" version. Even though statistics and graphs were behind the Pro version you could use the app just fine. Not anymore, it adds wait times between adding expenses and limits you to adding only 4 expenses a day, so miss a couple days and suddenly you can't catch up. Definitely not worth it anymore and will be moving to an alternative or the old pen and paper approach (which won't take much longer)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely worst, after the update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is super convenient to help us with all the expenses calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible option to upgrade to add expenses? Very annoying service. You guys were good for so many years. Why are you guys so greedy now?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless now without paid version. gross"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good while it lasted... ""daily free expenses"" really? I like to manage the expenses of my group and now I'd need to ask them to let me use their app because of the limit, guess i'm finding another app. Edit: typo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes has made this great app worst now. How can a person who is on trip is limited to some xyz transactions a day? It's high time to look for some alternatives. Adios Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is now unusable with only 5 transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What's with this per day expense limit , why do I need to buy pro for basic split expense feature , there are many other apps which are providing unlimited expenses per day for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New daily limit is just stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Getting unusable ... switching for Splitd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Exhausting expenses limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for 3 expense per day, I'm not gonna use this app further thanks for your service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I rarely rate apps, but I made sure to open up the playstore just so I can say how awfil this garbage app is. Ads with every expense you add and a limit of 3 expenses per day. I know people need to make money but have a bit of shame, this is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To the one who thought it was a great business idea to create a limit for expenses entered per day: 👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was used to love it, but now we split up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely user unfriendly change with limitation of entries per day. What the hell are the product folks thinking. Watch another app taking over this space soon if this is not removed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit? Can't use it for trips with friends now. Switching to open source alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great UI"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is with waiting time every time I add expense? Uninstalling this garbage. It was better before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can you not make basic functionality premium?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not letting me put expenses more than 2 at a time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why this restrictions on limited number of entry. You are having add also. Very poor experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Atleast 15 transaction should be allowed per day. It's worst update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Many restrictions. Thinking to move to some better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously? Nope."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app sucks now after the limits on number of transactions in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for years, but now confronted with serious limitations when not willing to pay a hefty amount per month/year. I understand keeping an app running costs money, but please inform users upfront about this, offer an advert option or look for other sponsorship"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"with the new 3 transaction limit per day, this app is now useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I really liked this app for six years, they then limited the number of transactions that could be added per day. It's now useless for budgeting holidays. It's a real shame as it's too expensive. Id have happily paid half the price"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, I would have bought the Pro version, but the developer got greedy and now it's a subscription model. Not paying!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad monetization strategy by limiting 3 expenes (Hampering user experience)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You randomly change the usage rules, add timers and force people to pay premium. I understand the need to make money, but showing ads is better than forcing a ridiculous $40 per year for an app that has over 10 different alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You got lost for the money, so sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously this app was good. But they want money for everything. You can't add more than 3 expenses in a day and for adding every expense, it will display ads. Such a stupid move by the developer to push users to buy Pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They make you wait in between adding expenses to try and bully you into buying the premium version. I've rarely seen a more passive aggressive marketing strategy. They don't even have ad in there, they just tell you should buy the premium package. Lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Congrats on destroying a perfectly functioning app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Scummy. They remove already existing features, then make you PAY money to get the old features back. The ethical way to do this is to make NEW features that are paid. Don't charge for things that have always been free. Again, very scummy company. Avoid at all costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are so many less obstructive options to monetize, but unfortunately, they chose the worst of them. It's been helpful so far, but I'm out now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Used to be good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After 4 expenses per day u gotta pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day? Or buy your paid version? This limit is irritating and not a good way to charge money. I am shifting to other app. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can add only 3 expenses a day, or you have to take premium. May be you can switch to ad's model, just a suggestion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"On utilisait cette application dans notre couple pour gérer le budget mais depuis peu, SplitWise impose ENORMEMENT de limites et de contraintes dans tout ce qu'on pouvait faire, jusqu'à afficher des popups incessantes pour passer à la version pro (30€/an ou 3€ par mois!!), à limiter à 3 transactions par jour et à interdire les photos de ticket. Franchement, si c'est pour décourager les gens, continuez, vous êtes des génies. On se casse de SplitWise et on va sur SPLITSER qui est gratuit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"CORPORATE GREED. UNINSTALLED."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app...easy to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is no more free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restriction on 3 entries a day made me to restrict the use of this app and switch for new one. Bye bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible paywall now, used to be fantastic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really nice expense managing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has advertisements now. Very jarring"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a terrible decision by the management to severely restrict non-premium users without any prior communication to the users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Frequent user for household and trip expenses for many years. Limit of 3 a day is too restrictive for trip usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simple and a user friendly app. Thanks for creating this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until they monetized it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing life saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why is it limiting my expenses lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"expense adding limitations are absurd. extorting longtime users into a subscription is terrible practice. do not get the app in it's current state"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great application until it was free in its basic version, now it has became totally commercial with making only 2 expenses per day, I have been using this app for more than 8years now looking for other applications of this type RIP splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Like Splitwise, it's a great tool for group trips/events/vacations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please make it mandatory for a user to not be able to uninstall the app until you clear all the balances. Mere bohot Paise chale gaye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day lol... Basically useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was using this app since last 5 years but the recent changes have made it impossible to use, I get the pro model and charges but it should not hinder the basics. Looking for an alternative in the play market to switch. This is unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was a perfect app and Recommend to ally friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was great app. New changes for forcing people onto pro has kind made the app 💩 now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst idea to make the app a paid app for the same features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a geat app, but the new focus on the paid subscription by punishing free user (ads before every action, maximum amount of actions) instead of adding on what you can get to subscribe is very grimy, not a good look and makes me want to check other similar apps that is not a pain in the butt to use. Would not recommend anymore since this new thing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. We now use this on every trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to find alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Classic example of greed! I'm simply amazed at the audacity of the developer. Asking $4/month for what is essentially an excel spreadsheet. This app was just a conveninece before, not a requirement. Now that it has ceased to be one, it gets the uninstall hammer! Oh but wait, due to the unashamed greed on full display, I am giving this 1 star review to bring it down even further."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant, makes girls holidays and nights out much simpler 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I will uninstall it soon if they don't remove the limit on daily additions. Just show ads and keep the app free FFS"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"data stealing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, but stupid decision to limit adding expenses for the free version. You can put fearures behind paywall but not the core functionality. Find another way to charge users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using since long time but now they provide only 3 trx per day for record... With advertisment.. Uninstallijg and searching alternative option s."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For each expense if I have to look through 30sec pair of ads. This is absolutely ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for the last year or so, and it's been great. I used the free version to keep track of my expenses with my boyfriend because we split costs often. I deleted it today because they implemented a new change where you can only add a maximum of 5 expenses per day, and they also added unskippable ads between each expense you want to enter. It's like they're forcing me to buy the premium version now. Absolutely disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad since the subscription has come with so much limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless with the new limits. Will migrate to a better app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed. Have been a loyal user since years. Have also used the premium version for some time. But locking most basic features behind a paywall is simply unacceptable. Maximum 4 expenses per day? Seriously? The wait time is also ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling the app. Too many ads and asking to pay again and again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am using Splitwise from past 5 years but from past few months only 3 transactions are allowed which is making the application pathetic. Developers should have brought some additional premium features and making basic features non premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Timers and limits on the number of expenses you can add for free each day make this app no longer useable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is pretty useless without pro. It's ridiculous that one can only add 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yearly subscription 999 is very costly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wish it had a function to beat friends if they dont pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic attempt at squeezing money from people, now splitwise is only allowing to add 3-4 expenses each day, and blocking adding any more expenses. Such a predetory move!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app ruined.. the limit on daily transactions is just ridiculous! going back to spreadsheets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I too have been using this app for around 7 years. Loved it. Recommended it to everyone. Great features, straight forward. But then you decide to monitize by limiting people on the free version to 4 entries in total a day, 2 of 4 are 10 second delayed. I am no longer using this app after this trip. I would have been willing to pay a 30 or even 40 dollar one time fee, or pay 9.99 a year. But then you come out with $40 a year, 4.99/mo thats almost as much as Office 365. This will be goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible limitations for the sake of attracting premium subscribers. This is not how you do it, sorry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The story of this app is how to kill the best app in market with ""smart"" marketing. This app got very aggressive policy to force people to buy the pro version. Basic version become basically unusable. Limit of 3 expenses per day is a joke. Whoever came up with this decision should be fired"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app of its kind. None of the others even come close. Worth paying for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for years. I used to appreciate the app and referred it to more than 50 friends. But their recent changes attempting to monetize the app are the worst. I don't mind paying a flat fee of $10-20 to purchase the app for lifetime. However, a $5 monthly fee is too much and just not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"All good until you need to enter more than 3 transactions a day. TBH the price is unjustified for what's it worth. Would happily pay maybe around $15-$20 one time. If the developer is worried about the storage fee, just enhance your app to use dropbox or something similar."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I didn't read the reviews until after I downloaded the app. As the others have said, the app is basically useless now. The limitations make it impossible to really evaluate the app. Caveat emptor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app saved a large group of us from having to worry about splitting up charges at the table, bar, or transportation, and allowed us more time to enjoy our vacation. This was a peacemaker and a sanity-saver in the end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything locked behind paywall. unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for about 5 years. It's convenient but does not provide much service beyond a nicely made Google sheet. I don't know why, without warning to its users, they thought they could charge $40+ a year to add more than 4 expenses. This has destroyed its functionality for free users. Do something else to better monetize - banner ads, 30sec video ads after 10 expenses, or a more reasonable subscription cost (~$1/month). Transferring my data and making aforementioned Google sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great - used it for years. Now, they only let you add 3 expenses per day unless you upgrade to the $40/year subscription. Splitwise is dead, no way I am paying $40 subscription for something I use 2x per year. Splid, Tricount, Cashew would all be better alternatives. SPLITWISE IS DEAD :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Reduced my rating from 5 to 1 since the last changes forcing subscription are too much, they should have tried another route"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app that they randomly added a cap of 4 transactions a day, two of them with 10-second ""pay for premium"" delays. Really lame that they destroyed the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden without any warning you are capped for daily transactions. Very unethical"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting basic features that previously existed as free behind a paywall. seriously basic expenses addition is limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app now basically useless without paying for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of transactions is the worst decision by splitwise. It is very irritating. Looking for an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We have been using this app for a year. It is unusable since one can only add 3 expenses a day (and having to wait 10 seconds per expense) in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic ad prompt when adding expenses, used this app during whole college life, bidding farewell for now. So long Splitwise. Had a good run."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your time downloading it. It was good back then but then the developer becomes too greedy. After just adding 4 expense you need to buy there pro plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"2017 - Such a simple and easy way to keep track of expenses. No blame game and everything is accounted for in this app. I'm recommending it to everybody that I can. Update 2023: Not recommending anymore due to forced ads + huge push to paid subscription. No warning in advance either - they clearly just want your money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Imagine paying money to keep a track of paying money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great tool - perfect for splitting any sort of costs. have used it on multiple group trips and really love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is a bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update forces people to subscribe, 3 new items a day? Unbelievable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great until they got greedy and limited to 3 transactions per day without a subscription. Also making you wait 10 seconds per transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not working properly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst experience with the app,,, one guy deleted the group without settled up the balance,,, need to add the feature so that not everyone could able to delete the group before settled each one's amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ever since they locked extra entries behind a paywall, this app has gone downhill. Used to use it regularly, now I use a better alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic and greedy developer..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Superb app for split with your roomies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was satisfied with the app until the recent change. It is very inconvenient and too expensive to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"While I acknowledge the need for app monetization, imposing constraints on expense entries, coupled with a time delay, within the free version seems counterintuitive. The apparent strategy of nudging users towards upgrading to the PRO version doesn't resonate well with me. If the monthly subscription is half the current price, then it will better reflect the value of this app... At the current pricing, I would not recommend this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used splitwise for years. Locking basic features behind a pay wall is so so stupid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"La versión gratuita deja subir 3 gastos por día y en cada gasto debes esperar un tiempo, esto hace casi imposible el usar la aplicación sin utilizar la versión pagada"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this for years and was happy. But now the enforced transaction limits to bring people to the pro version are too annoying and the pro price is too high as it is per person using it. Will switch to something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would be less annoyed if the paid version was a one time payment and not a monthly subscription. It is otherwise completely useless to me when there is a limit of number of expenses I can put in there now. I might as well just use Google sheets so everyone in the group has access to the spreadsheet and can add expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for keeping the expense track."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly the free tier doesn't let you add more than 3 expenses in a day. This is outrageous and will enable dedicated users to quit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"So many missing, obvious features. For example, I purchased dinner for a group on Doordash. As far as I can tell, there is zero way to auto split up this receipt, even after importing it into the app. I cancelled the subscription and will go back to splitting things by spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful App for managing exppenses with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For the recent update (timers on adding trxns)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app now that you can't even add more than 3 expenses using the free tier, with 10 seconds in between. Used to use this all the time but now it's useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty sad that you now limit the amount of expenses. There are less aggressive ways to monetize the app. I'll not recommend it anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"just introduce premium to remove ads instead of making this app practically unusable please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great till they removed all basic features and put them behind a paywall... like gee, pay for it or find a free app that does the exact same thing? Jan 9th, 2024 Update: Saved myself $40 CAD and hours of frustration by simply moving everything over to settle up. Same functionality, different look, free, 0 limitations. Bye splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor. Not only the 'not free version' but also the settings and defaults of the app. 0 stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great trip manager!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking to pay for nothing, not even making sums correctly???! Uninstalled forever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app ruined by a terrible monetisation strategy. Stopping using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"forced ads ruining this app, used to be good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They removed the possibility to insert expenses for free and you need to wait when adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Will have to stop using it due to the daily limit to add expenses. This change is killing the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So many changes in a short span of time. Stop receipt upload, limit daily expenses, have to watch ad before the next expense. This is crazy, you're driving a huge chunk of your users out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have started restricting use behind a pay wall, was a good app until then. Minimum amount of payments, and a timedelay. Not cool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become useless if you don't pay the $5 per month for the Pro version. You are limited to 3 expenses per day and have to watch an ad for Splitwise Pro before you can enter each expense. Ughhhh, terrible user experience. For an app I only use occasionally, waaay to expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is very convenient for recording expenses between multiple people and doing the simple math as to who owes what to whom. My friends and I use it often for group trips when someone pays for everyone, then we settle up later. It's great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Second review: After years of using spltiwise. They killed the app with ads and limits. Sad..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"˙◠˙ paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Once added the expense, only the people in that expense can change it. It would be nice if the person that added the expense can modify it too. Done times is one one person doing the hard work :-)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money looooooooters"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduction of expense input limit is ridiculous. 10 second timer to add expenses is horrible practice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Lovely App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A few months ago, I noticed I couldn't add receipts. Now I can't even add more than a few expenses. Why is splitwise monetizing something that has been perfect and not changed after all these years? $40/year is ridiculous. The app is no more worth than $0.99. I will be moving away as soon as all my expenses are settled.... or maybe I'll need a ""Pro"" version to view my balances as well?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for maybe a decade already and have recommended this to friends since. The daily limit when not in pro is such a pain. Some days I can input 3, some days only 1 and it's maxed. This tool is useful for group trips and such, but the premium is so hard to agree with esp when you don't use this as often as before anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible update. A great app ruined by marketing. Enforcing three transactions per day makes this app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app until they started to push their paid version by limiting you to 3 transactions per day. Will happily choose a free alternative and hope they learn their lesson."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is once free should be always free. If you want to add monetization for some feature, then add a new premium feature and monetize that using a premium plan. Don't change the existing ones. This is just baiting. Forced to uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was awesome, but in recent the restrictions made the app of no use. I'm going to uninstall it. Tata"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The premium only feature makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The way they are asking for a subscription is unjust. I loved the app but switching to other options now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I would definitely get the pro version if it were cheaper for Colombia."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"i wont pay to use it twice a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise for years. The pop-ups to subscribe to pro before adding expenses, and having a 3 expense limit/day is a terrible idea, especially when there are multiple free alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It works. Not sure about pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until they decided to completely brick it by adding expense limits and waiting screens, now it's unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization is ok, but doing so by adding premium features and having an acceptable pricing plan. The paywall to even add a basic expense after 3x day and a minimum subscription price of 5$/month is just ridiculous. The 1 star review is not for the app quality (which is ok and deserve 4 stars - ui is a bit old and there are quirks here and there) but to make devs understand that this is not the way to go. There are a bunch of new apps that are growing and are taking the place of this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App ruined as now you can only add a maximum of 3 transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm ready to pay a reasonable amount for the pro but forcing limitations on transactions is a scummy thing to do. I hope everyone abandons this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can't do without this app if you are sharing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pro has messed it up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Been using this app for years, but recently they resticted the number of expenses you can add per day and force you to go premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until they decided they wanted to charge a monthly fee and basically made the app unusable unless you pay it. Off elsewhere thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the latest update, the free version of this app is basically useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was once a great app. Taking away features that were free will never be a good practice. If you want people to buy the subscription, make that product better. Don't make the free product worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment scheme is shocking!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is pure cheating to users... We have been using this app since last 6 years. But why company changed it to 3 time update per day only. Very disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a ridiculously high price for the basic functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Hi, please change the owes word to A given or B given or A paid or B paid.It's sometimes confusing.India is a country of mostly Hindi speaking people so if you use easy English then it will be more easy for the people to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After ads and limits on adding expenses on basic account this app sucks now for it's basic purpose."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only register 3 expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Convenient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit ruined the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"works well but needs: - better clarification of expenses. I regularly add my local shop name as a description for groceries but always have to classify it manually - can only see history for the last 3 months for each category"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you restrict basic functionality of an app behind a paywall ??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added limit per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It would be great if there was the ability to add guests – people who happen to be with the group but aren't usually. Edit: response from developer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hiding advanced and cool features behind a pay wall is fine, but limiting the number of expenses one can add per day? This is not a free app anymore... don't advertise it as such."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Predatory monetisation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Docking two stars because the app is very restricted for non-paying users now. Most pertinently, it doesn't allow you to add bill images now. All this would've been forgiven if the paid version was priced reasonably, but at 1000 INR a year, it's a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its started charging for the app if u want to use the app more then 3 time in a dag u have to pay 149 for monthly or 999 for yearly subscription fees"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3-4 entries per day is not enough!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One can add only two expenses per day which is insane"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ruined the app by forcing us to buy Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without any notice, Splitwise decided change their features and pricing structure. Time to use Google spreadsheet to keep track of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Just horrible. What was the reason and logic behind limiting the number of expenses per day? Just to make 10 bucks per user per month? Disgusting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app..not allow to add more than 3 entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Without any notification they have brought daily limit to add expenses in the app. Very cheap. I'm deleting my account, there are lost of other free app to track expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"incorporating this subscription or paid model where we can add only 2-4 expenses and this making me to uninstall. Trying to understand, adding this model is not helping daily users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Scabs. Why do greedy people feel the need to ruin everything good in the world. Once an essential app, now a useless waste of space unless you pay their exorbitant subscription fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great. But with their current pricing for the pro version, it has become useless. Even if the app was a one-time purchase, I would have considered it, but with a yearly subscription of $40 is crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new feature that makes you wait to add an expense and limits the no of expenses you can add to 5 per day IS SO ANNOYING!! makes the free version very unfriendly to use. You may as well make it a paid app Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been slowly removing features over the past year to force users into paying for the pro version. Used to be a decent app, but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even to put limit on no of expenses per day is ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Brutal changes to make it paid. Basically useless. We have to aggregate expenses in excel and then add a dump to one post each which completely defeats the purpose of using this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forces you to buy the Pro feature.You may show ads but don't eliminate the basic feature of adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand introducing a paid version but eliminating the very basic feature of adding expenses was a baaaaddddd move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Similar experience to what the recent reviews have said, only 3-4 expenses a day as to before it was unlimited, taken away features we already had access too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years and I love it. So convenient, I can let go and it does the math. friends and I check in and there's no weird feelings because we see it all there in plain numbers. love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Losing unlimited transactions per day made the app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used Splitwise for years to manage trips and ongoing expenses with my partner. Now they have effectively destroyed their own app by changing their pricing model. The free version now only allows 3 transactions per day which is absolutely useless. Whoever decided to implement this is out of their mind and they should find better ways to monetize their app. Disgusting business practice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed killed the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good before but worst now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be top. Recent update with ads made it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is unusable with daily transaction limit. Wouldn't recommend anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye bye. Forcing with just 3 expenses where there's so many alternatives there and also the pricing for India is insane"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"D*** move. Iykyk"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this a couple time over the last few years. Was getting ready for a trip, I installed this and immediately saw all the new paywall and bad reviews. Never Uninstaller a app so quick, and won't be coming back. On to the next better thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They found the most Stupid way to beg for money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dropping this, as they are paywalling its main feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfeito"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ottima app per dividere le spese condivise con amici e ottimizzare i rimborsi spesa."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of expenses you can add in a day ? That is just greedy now. I would pay extra for EXTRA features , not just to use the basic ones"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a great app untill December 2023. I mean this is a simple application but it limits to add the expenses per day. I mean wth! what's the use of this when they do that. and also the premium for this? are you kidding. I have uninstalled this and searched for an alternative. it's the best now. but still, been using this from past 4 yrs, now RIP!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, until they decided to severely limit the number of transactions yo can input daily into the free version. This makes the free version pretty useless unless you pay for pro. Real shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst decision of limiting transactions to 3 per day. Searching for alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for expensive calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great, but limiting the expense limit has ruined it. The 10 second delay to watch ads would be an acceptable move for a free tier, but the daily low expense limit is a gross overstep."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now we can only add upto 2 expenses day only. And now they are charging 149 per month not at all worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Am using this app for 9 years, recently it is asking for pro version. I purchased a yearly plan 999, but still, the pro is not activated.... Very bad service....please resolve my issue asap. I have written a mail for support splitwise, but still , it's not resolved.... Please help me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing more than 4 expenses even though using for first time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making a historically free product paid, especially if it's the most basic of functions, is a bad idea."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Most pathetic way of charging you money. Axio is far better than this. The only challenge is cross platform in axio. Otherwise, I never would've installed this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good app, but they lost a lot of good will when they suddenly started hiding basic functionalities behind a paywall. Not the way to roll out new features. Will be looking for more forthright alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used splitwise for the past 2 years to track expenses. now completely useless as all relevant features are behind a paywall that's way too high for the features offered. show an ad every now and again if you want to make some money, but dont put a timer amd a 3-daily transaction limit. Ridiculous. If it were a 1 time payment i would definitely reconsider. Bad user experience. 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"🥰🥰🥰"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows to add only 3 expense per day, indirectly forcing to pay to use the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sending message for 10 days old settled bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app with advanced features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why? Why did you do this? You could've put ads, or asked us to pay 20 30 rs a month. Ruined the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrendous that the expenses limit is set to 3 per day. I understand the need to monetize, but the amount of money charged is insane."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No need to rely on your mates foggy memory who sweared he paid for the late night feed at the end of a big night out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"restriction for entry is horrible , need to look for alternative apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions a day! This app has become useless to use for friend groups. Guess I will look for something new."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you know what you did"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wonderful app. very convenient for our group travels. Thanks 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app but premium amount on a subscription basis is too costly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update allows only 3 entries per day, that too with obnoxious ad insertion. This is ridiculous, and the price of premium is likewise absurd. Switching to alternative apps now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using the free app for more than 10 years and it was working great. However, the recent change of limiting the number of transactions you can add is not a good look on the app. It is a bad business practice to force users to move to the paid version for basic features. I'm sure this practice won't result in converting free users to paid uses in masses and instead everyone will eventually move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What happened? Did some PE firm buy this app? How greedy can you get? It's ok to monetize, but limiting number of expenses to 2 per day, doing shady things like having a delay to add free expenses? Ewww, dude. There are plenty of other (free) apps that we can use. Adios, brother. You suck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limited to 3 expenses per day, while lots of app will let you do more for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very user friendly, convenient for multiple expenses to split, real time update. The trending of expenses was good to have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No point of this app now. Greedy company!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the new update, it only allows you to add utpo 3 expenses daily. Poorly implemented without prior communication."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Put ads and srop charging people insane amount of money for something that the AI does."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting transactions per for free users is a great way to lose customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good until they limited the number of expenses to input per day. The waiting to input expenses until you sit there as they advertise the pro version is annoying, but bearable. The change to limit # of expenses per day makes it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"absolute garbage change to try and extract money. Couldn't use the app to add expenses and locked me out - instant uninstall bubye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please stop with the 10 second waita for adding expenses + Limits for adding expenses. It is ruining the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been helpful for so many years, but now is barely usable due to the limit on daily expenses. 3 expenses per day is not at all feasible for regular users, and there was no warning that this would go into effect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Era ótimo. Agora quer cobrar para um Pro de qualquer jeito. Recomendava para todos usarem. Agora recomendo que troquem para outros apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Once a great app. Not anymore. Everything is a pro feature now. Even the basic add expense is a pro feature after adding 4 expense. Sad to see this. Leaving the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I feel betrayed by the App because of the Daily Expense Limit and ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was my go to app for splitting bills for over a decade but has recently been heavily monetized. You can only add four expenses per day now. Instant uninstall once that happened!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously!?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, now useless with three transactions a day limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was my favourite expense app but is now the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worthless and waste of time. Only allows adding a few expenses per day. Moving to some apps. Just trying Splid for now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simple way of sharing the costs for any event"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for years and it's awesome but an ad before every expense you want to add? Max 4 expenses a day?? That's garbage. If this doesn't change in the coming month I'll simply go to another app and take all my friends to another app. A monthly subscription of 5 euro is also way to expensive for the services it offers. I would pay a one time fee of 5 euro but certainly not every month. Sad you guys ruined this nice app. Tip: go try Tricount which does not try to rip you off"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise every since it was launched, but now they are only allowing adding 3 expenses a day, on top of ads. I am done with this app, will look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New Review : 1* This was my go to app and have been using for more than 5 years (Not anymore i guess). new pricing is ridiculous for the feature that competitors are offering for Free. As loyal customer i would have definitely paid a one time fee or a small charge (even with alternatives available) but new pricing is ridiculous for a feature which has absolute million alternatives. Sorry to say but Good Bye Splitwise!!!!! Original Review : 5* Really good app with app as well as web intefface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Era um ótimo app, mas agora só na versão Pro. Parei de usar."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not in the habit of review bombing, but this new ""3 expenses per day"" malarkey makes the free app essentially unusable. You guys had a good run, but this is the sort of thing that can tank a product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses for free is horrible. Need better features to justify pro account. Way too expensive for what it is. It's a 1x per month type of app. Try another split payment app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to add expenses now , forcing paid membership. Deleting the app . Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app for years. It used to be great but now the push to buy pro and being not able to add more than 3 expenses a day is worst thing. Not usable anymore. Looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New feature is worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Need payment integration like Paytm in India..it was there now taken out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a user for years and years. Now I'm considering switching. The app is unusable with the new limit of 3 entries per day and the 10 second wait for each entry. Also, the features offered are way too basic even for the free tier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"the recent update is really bad .. not allowing to update the expense after 3 times."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore without paying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is forcing us to get the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until it got too greedy. Uninstalled and found a free replacement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Has always helped settling up group spends whenever I went on trip with my friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why charges ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for daily expenses for 3 years now, but now with the new update it has become unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 5 entries allowed in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such a poor latest feature. Horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expanse a day!!!! Seriously!!!! Let's find an alternative.... Uninstalling right now..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why have to pay for such a simple operation, can easily do it with Excel. And price is too high. One time prepectual payment is enough for life time license, such as: 399/-"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a paid app, not free to use. You can only add a small number of expenses per day. What's the point of using the ""free version"" if it's more convenient just to pay as we go...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a Super app, once the limited entries was introduced It is the most worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simple and easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a great app before they limited the number of adds you can do per day. Venmo has a free easy to use group feature now for free. Also, splitwise pay takes 3 extra days to get cleared. Simply venmoeing the amount you owe / are owed is way easier and faster. If these are changed I will continue to use splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad after pro. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great useful app now useless without the pro account. The expense limit is dumb. Would consider paying if it was not a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be my favourite split bill app. However, with the new update which we can only add 3 expenses per day ruined the app. Unfortunately I'm trying to find another alternative for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously, this was good. But now features that were free are now requiring a subscription(receipt photos and daily limit of expenses). Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too bad to restrict 4 expenses per day. need to subscribe to use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be one of the best bill splitting app until they limit the amount of expenses you can add unless you pay.........guess its time to use a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was fantastic until they brought in their ridiculous cooldown on splits. Other apps have ads without this nonsense, made it unusable. Plenty of other apps for splitting!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The team at Splitwise seems to be blowing it. With the changes they made now requiring Pro makes this app unusable for what it used to be best for - Trips! Worse so though, with the recent changes they seem to have introduced a bunch of major bugs. I am part of a group where people owe me a significant amount of money, that I can now no longer see (no one else has changed any of the group settings.) No response in days from Splitwise customer support yet either. Sad, I used to love this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So useful for years but the new expenses per day limit is ridiculous. I don't mind seeing ads but I'm limited so much now it's just pointless. Will find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to like this app. Then added ads to literally all actions, will uninstall if this isn't retracted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Its very useful, however the search function is suboptimal. Another complaint is they double the price in the laste year without adding any functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you guys insane you may be get replaced easily with some else app which can import your app data, might be the reason for downfall, add premium to luxury not to necessity..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like many reviewers, I come here to say that this has been a fabulous app for years but the developers have gambled their success on a subscription model that's completely outrageous. Basic functions are now limited (unskippable ads to add an expense, and 3 max expenses per day) unless you pay a monthly subscription. Like most here, I'd have accepted a single payment for basic functions, but I'll search for alternatives or use a spreadsheet rather than adding another monthly subscription... Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app daily for years but I've just decided to dip. I am simply not subscribing, I'm not waiting to add expenses and I'm not settling for limited entries per day when I can get the same functionality elsewhere for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Become worst now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For ads and premium subscription. Need one time buy option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version unusable with loading time, change to different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New updates have destroyed the up for good, not at all expected from the team coming up with such an idea"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add more expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Confusing and lack a lot of good features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I would give it a 5 star if the pro wasn't that expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst worst app ever since they introduced advertisement, really you think I will pay you to keep track of my money you morons"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now adding expenses is reduced, it's not fair."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too costly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Demanding money if I put more than 4 expenses and also showing ads. Not expected from Spltwise ☹️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"brilliant and so useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bekar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously 5 stars. I've been a loyal user of this app for nearly a decade. I use it to split household expenses at the end of every month, so for our entire household to upgrade to the yearly fee, it would cost well over $200/year which is deeply unsustainable. It's now impossible to use as a free user, and therefore completely unrealistic to get new friends to download what used to be an indespensible app. I'd happy pay a one time cost to continue using Splitwise but $5/month is insane."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I like the app but i don't see any benefit paying every year for it. I would be willing to pay once but not every year. So for me thats goodbye to this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"U can't force user to buy u r app just by restrictions Disappointed will be uninstalling the same... Split bills etc lots of apps are there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This used to be a useful app. The recent changes which were designed to make you pay £30 per year make it close to unusable. I would have paid for the Pro version, but they are out of touch with the apps worth. If £30 was a lifetime purchase, I'd probably pay it as a once off, but it's not worth £30 per year. Maybe something like £3 per year would be fair. It's just such a strange thing to completely brick a useful bit of software to try to force people into paying a premium subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I Understand this is a business, but you are killing the app with the ridiculous free tier daily limit of insertions. I use the app for years, am going to stop using it. The app is great, but It is Just a Fancy spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Their recent decision to limit the transaction entry to 3 per day and forcing the users to buy the pro version at such an exorbitant price is not acceptable. I am looking for some alternative apps to resolve my problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update of ads and 2 expenses per day has made the usage cumbersome and unpleasant. Violated the basic need of the app itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version of this app has become totally unusable. Forcing to switch to premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Found no UPI or any other mode of payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise regularly since 2018. It's been my go to app for calculating travel and household expenses. However, this recent change has really made it unusable. Only allowing 3 transactions per day is ludicrous. I understand that they need revenue, but making it a monthly subscription is insane. $5 a month just doesn't make sense for what is basically a glorified spreadsheet with a user friendly GUI. I would happily pay $10-$20 once off, as the app is useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To encourage people to subscribe to the premium version, it appears the developers had the bright idea to make the free model of the app unuseable. Like so many others, I used the app for years but I'm now seeking an alternative because I can't stand it much longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined what used to be perfect. Looking for other options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I’ve been happily using this app for years however the app developer removed simple functionality and wants to pay for a pro subscriptions every month? This beautiful app has gone from being efficient to an app with ads, limits everywhere and constant reminders of upgrading to pro…it’s completely bloatware now, such a disappointment cause of possible greed. Won’t recommend using this app to anyone, will be sadly looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The changes that they decided to implement is a detriment to the goodwill this app has brought to many people in the past. Instead of introducing new/paid features to add value to the user experience, the devs decided to lock previously free function behind the pay wall of splitwise pro. They introduced a 10 second wait to add expenses, removed the ability to attach photos to transactions, and added a daily limit on expense added, making the free version cumbersome to use to say the least."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I paid a subscription for collecting expenses of my trip, it was easy and user friendly app. But when I cenceled subscription, all my data was deleted immediately even it had some period of time before my subscription expires I now cant access or see anythings of my trip. AWFUL!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Filled with ads. Pathetic limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"After two years using them, they have worsen the free tier service. First they got rid of the option to add images to the expenses using the app, then they added a daily limit to the expenses you add daily, and now I need to wait 10 seconds to add an expense. This kind of practice is awful, and instead of considering the premium tier I'd rather move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is close to useless now because it limits you to 4 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall and High Subscription amount for most basic features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't force customers to go for pro by limiting input. Be creative, add more stuff and request for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As other users have mentioned, daily expense limit makes this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ever since it became a paid application, splitwise started sucking bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The cap on how many transactions can be posted per day renders the app almost useless unless you get the Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you can only add very limited expenses like 4 or 5 in a day in the free version which is extremely bad move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing users to pay for a basic menial app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but free tier is now very restricted, might as well make the app paid to download because it's unusable like this. Some banner ads would be acceptable but let me add more expenses. Could give me the option to have unlimited expenses with close friends but paywall the rest ?."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a go-to app for me to split bills. But now, forcing users to upgrade to a pro version by limiting to add only 4 transactions a day is a worst move for a company making it a worst app now. THE BASIC FEATURE AND PURPOSE FOR THIS APP IS TO ADD/SPLIT BILLS, AND IF THAT FEATURE ITSELF IS MADE AS PAID FEATURE, THEN FOR WHAT PURSPOSE SHOULD A NEW USER/EXISTISNG USER DOWNLOAD AND USE THIS APP. ***HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO SEARCH FOR AN ALTERNATIVE APP***"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Giving this rating just because of new limit update with ads in between. I've been using the app since last 8 years for expenses record but this new update is really annoying. If the company wants to bring this update then better to bring it for new joinees.. not for old existing ones."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined the app by forcing people to purchase a premium. They could generate revenue by ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you need to pay for using this app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, but they blocked adding more than 4 expenses per day in a free version which made it unuseful :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and now they have this stupid expense limit. How are you supposed to do anything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too mich money minded... only 4 expenses a day allowed. I need to get pro version to add more itseems. Had been a customer for almost 10 years now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is good for pro version not for the free usage. Found the alternative free app. No more required this. Bye bye 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app until the recent changes were introduced to put a limit on transactions per day. It has become very irritating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"this app is awesome, I don't review apps frequently but this one deserves!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day limit is absurd, looking for alternatives as of now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thanks for making it completely paid, I have moved to other app after 9 years so will most of the people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Jabse pro version ke changes aaye hai, app is crashing too much on startup"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"top"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I think split wise should think upon its revenue model. Limit expenses is not great solution to generate revenue. Please rethink until uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,". the latest update made it worse.. asking money to split bills... now leaving the splitwise.. worst app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good. Now that they introduced 'premium' features, its basically unusable. Limits on number of expenses completely defeats the purpose of using this app for convenience. Might as well keep an excel sheet instead. I would understand if it were a one time payment, and I would gladly pay 5 bucks for it, but a subscription service is just a slap on the face. Do not use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"literally must-pay-to-use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Didn't like the direction app is taking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The 3 transactions per day limit is the worst thing that happened to this app recently. Please remove this limit or at least increase the limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a very useful app but now every functionality wants you to upgrade and pay !! Even the default currency changes back so that a memership prompt can be displayed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best for tracking expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really good but they've taken a step in the wrong direction by adding a max number of payments in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise for years now and has been one of the most convenient things across all things, but the latest update of limiting expenses /day and the wait time to log an expense is too annoying and a cheap move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So disappointed that you can now only enter 3 expenses per day. Have been using this for years to track expenses and now it's barely usable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app and work well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a really great app to manage expenses , but the recent update makes it so that you can't add your expenses after a certain limit (3 per day) and constant ads for every single addition of expenses ruined the experience, now it's a horrible app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great idea, but hard to navigate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do you need my money to manage my money? (Only 4 expenses per day!!!!)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited feature is the worst decision taken..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is pretty useless now, should be pay-only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using splitwise for many years now and it has been the most convenient & user friendly app to keep track of the shared expenses between family & friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nothing works after new update in Android 10"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would much rather pay a one off cost to make use of the pro features rather than an ongoing subscription which seems counter productive to make this app worthwhile longterm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless apk"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's insane. Only 3 per day to Add .Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are 100s of txn sharing apps . We trusted you and now you made pro for 4$ a month? What's so innovative In this app to pay that high when there are more pro apps that scan bills too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"clean UI and saved me lot of Hassel in settling bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for years. I understand that the company needs to start making money eventually, but this was the wrong way to monetize. Making the free version of the app nearly unusable is not the right strategy. At the very least they should have provided a lifetime license, I would have picked it up. I've decided to try to use either Tri Count or Venmo Groups as an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Predatory pricing since last update Used for a while, now you have to wait a hard 10s and pay 30-40 USD/year per person I was waiting for a pro version with actual useful features like custom bucketing with nlp to do categorisation based on a set of rules, I coded the soln myself in a day instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, got greedy limiting expenses daily. Not worth keeping."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New expense limit is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now you need to pay to use its most basic functionality. Will delete and use my brain like I used to!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can change the rules anytime. And so I can change my rate. Take one star for the greediness. And out for a similar solution I am going."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great but is now useless. If it was a one time purchase of $60 I'd consider the pro account, or cheaper per month, I'd maybe feel it was worth it. Or if there were ads but no expense limit per day, I'd suck it up. However, both adverisements AND a limit to expenses means it's worthless to me. the price is just too steep. going to try to create a spreadsheet to use with people instead, that will be really free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of expenses to be able to add is a bad move and totally is against the initial motto of launching this app. I understand the need to monetize but this feature is forcing me to move away from splitwise after about a decade with it. Sad state of affairs with splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the go to for occasional expenses, trips, holidays, roommate stuff. But after the last introduction of pro tier it's unusable for free. There is no onetime pro payment, it's just monthly payment and unusable for people that use it here and there for personal stuff. Bye bye Splitwise. Looking for another product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now with that limit of 3 entries per day (and timer!) it got pretty much useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great when it was free. Now they limit your expenses you can add in a day, and make you watch ads for their pro version after the first few. 5 bucks a month or 40 a year is ridiculous for an app that used to be completely free. I understand wanting to make money, but this is a bit greedy. Very disappointed in the developers for this move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doing the rate limiting of adding expenses without even an announcement is an all time bad move and lost all the trust I had in the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was the best app and now it's probably the worst in the competition as you have limited expense addition in 24 hrs. It ok to charge for features but the base feature is expense addition, unlimited !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made the basic functions paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You need to get pro version to add more than 3 expenses per day.. 🤡 And pro version is not a 1 time purchase, it's a subscription 🤡🤡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent ads and limitations for non-premium users are completely ridiculous. There are plenty of better options, so I'll switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible! Asking users to pay the price for pro just to add more expenses in a day? Really? Pathetic on your side! If you don't remove this restriction, it's only a matter of time before everyone switches to a different app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest change limiting regular users to entering a max of 3 transactions a day is a terrible idea. What previously was a great app I would recommend to all my travel buddies is now useless to most unless you're willing to pay monthly (not even a one time fee!)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Excellent until the fire nation attacked"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Initially great for splitting expenses, but the recent addition of the Pro feature has been disappointing, affecting the overall experience negatively."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until they started charging 65 sek per month for basic features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app before they limited you to submitting 5 expenses. Going somewhere else now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Should be more user friendly, its confusing sometimes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app for keeping track of shared expenses. Now they are pushing the paid version and number of expenses entered per day is limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can give ads to run your business. Or charge a small amount. But asking 1000rs for a year. Wow you must be delusional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Typically when a company changes their policy in a way that heavily impacts every single free user, they let them know in advance and have a comm plan. No emails or communications were sent out. I can't use this app for its most basic feature anymore with this limit, so it is pointless to me. Switching to a new app without this limitation. I would honestly prefer an ad every few minutes to being blocked out of the app after 4 expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limiting the number of expenses per day and imposing 10 sec splitwise subscription promotional ads in between every expense ruined it for me. Definitely looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise, once a reliable expense manager, has now disappointed with its latest update. Limiting users to just three expenses per day in the free version is frustrating enough, but the real kicker is the exorbitant premium price for basic functionality. It feels like essential features are being held hostage behind a paywall. As a long-time user, the shift towards monetizing basic necessities is disheartening. Considering alternatives that value user needs without breaking the bank."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit to 3 is awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was great before they massively restricted the free version. But now I found a better alternative anyway"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become impossible to use after the limited expenses additions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Too many ads now. Max amount of splits. Ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable after recent update at all!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app tremendously degraded its user experience. Nevertheless, if you are looking for an Alternative, Tricount is an App you can go for people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Chutiya app 1 transaction limit and thereafter you will fprced to see the pro add to buy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor change of restricting number of transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"15-Jul-2019 5 Star Rating 03-Jan-2024 2 Star Rating. The application used to be the best. Now they are asking for a premium tier subscription for even the most basic functionality. They could very well sell the application as Premium instead of Freemium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've added a stupidly low limit on expenses (3) if you don't upgrade to pro. Makes it useless. Shame as had been using it for years. I understand them wanting to make money, but its simply not worth £40 a year. Like others, I'll be finding a alternative app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Will switch to a new app that does the same thing for free with fewer limitation after splitwise's unannounced money-grabbing subscription practices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get the ads part but the limited transactions is too much. Will move to Settle Up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a very good app, but with limited entries per day for non pro user it is nearly unusable for non paying users. Sad!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They completely ruined this app with monetization. They only let you add three expenses/day. Last time I'll be using this app, look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"suddenly got greedy and the free version experience tanked. can't do anything without having to wait for a ad for themselves and now there's a limit to expenses you can add in a day (quite low). if y'all want money, add new payed features. not this. this is gonna drive away users. terrible move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is restricting no of transactions to 3 per day which is extremely pathetic. Splitwise lost trust and it will be a great downfall for you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used it for a while within friends group but with new ridiculously low expense limit the app became useless. What do they expect? Get whole groups to subscribe? That's unlikely and the pricing is way too steep not worth the money. Make one time purchase for the app. Its just a glorified spreadsheet there is no way I'd subscribe to such service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic to bring in premium element for making more than one entry per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update app become useless.. before it was a cool app .. now it's the worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best and convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible experience after the recent change of limiting to 3 transactions per day. Normal users can't use the app now without paying the premium. Also the premium is so high for a normal user who sparingly use the app. Now I am in search of a good alternative for the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You now need to have the pro version just to add expenses which is frankly pathetic from the dev."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app then it starts loving showing advertisement. I was using this app since 2018 but now its very tough to manage expenses on split wise better to choose another app. Subscription price is also too high. It should be 100 then i guess maximum number will buy but as now maximum number will start using other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now you can't add more than 3 expenses a day without paying for it. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Force upgrade to pro is poorest thing split wise did, Flexy time onwards other app than split wise this is for sure, uninstalling the same! Tata @ssohle SW!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization policy is horrible, now it is just paid app with subscription basis, it is insane. The most user uses it time to time and pay the subscription for the app you are using 5 times a year is crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a very disappointed.. It's give only 3 transaction limit to add.. Please do needful actiove #splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"recent decision of making only 3 expense add is worst. they should find a better way of monetize their product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"useless without Pro now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced paid version and limited free version without any headsup"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even for a free tier, three expenses a day is pretty pitiful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a regular user of splitwise since 5 years now and it's quite insane that I am expected to pay an unreasonable amount for a task that can be done without the app. There was absolutely no notification and suddenly I have to wait for 10 seconds to add an expense! Absolutely pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switch to another application because of the 3 actions limitation. The application become totally useless and too expensive. The business model is not good, you should make two plans : one with no limitations and one with advanced features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A LIMIT ON HOW MANY EXPENSES CAN BE DONE PER DAY? FORCE ADS WITH EVERY EXPENSE? IN-YOUR-FACE PUSHES FOR PREMIUM??? well... now that's a way to destroy a pretty useful app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined this app by limiting the number of expenses you can add. Now they only let you add 4 per day unless you pay for the $5/month subscription. Super lame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for daily expenses calculation for bachelors."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful decision to put daily limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been a fan of splitwise as it was very user-friendly. But now they have allowed only 3 expense entries per day (that too with 10 secs ad in between) is just ridiculous. If they wanted income via a subscription model, then they should have worked on providing additional features with it and the basic version should have been free and it is when there are similar apps free of cost. Also they don't have any nominal or lifetime subscription and the monthly/yearly ones are very high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monthly subscription, are you kidding me? Just for basic product. Just invest in better product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Locked the ability to add more than 5 expenses per day behind a paywall, so switching to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very aggressive ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was our go-to for splitting expenses. From family to friends. Now that you can only enter 3 purchases a day, and you have to wait for an add about buying the subscription for 20 seconds every time, it is utterly useless. To be fair, if it would have been a fair price to buy the app for life, like 30$ for life, me and my family would have gladly paid it to support the developers. But yearly subscription for a ridiculous price. We will delete this app and never look back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are started limiting features. Which used to be free 🥺"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update, which limits transactions in the free version, is prompting users to uninstall the app. The amount charged is also excessively high. There should be an option to share the paid version among 5 to 10 people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switch to Settle Up. This app is amazing and I would totally pay for it but the price is too high and a ridiculous limit of 3 transactions has been added rendering it pretty much useless now. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app now limits you to 4 entries per day which is basically making it unusable, don't even try this app, just go back to spreadsheets and save your money. What an awful decision ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version suddenly unusable due to daily expense limit added without warning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing but they are now limiting the number of uploads to only 3 a day making it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is dead as it became pretty much a paid app. Try Splid, Tricount, Settle Up, Sesterce or Splitser."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"High price for it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sin dudas fue la mejor APP que tuve por años. Una lástima en lo que se convirtió, por pésimas decisiones comerciales. La opción de pago es una burla, precio totalmente exagerado y no lo vale. Buscando alternativas."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very limited transaction are allowed. Premium plan not accepted for such a simple app. As an SDE i can make this app in just 1 week."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be paramount for group expensing. The subscription based features were worth the low cost for international travelers due to the currency exchange tools alone. Now that the basic features of the app are also behind the paywall (which is almost double what it used to be), I can no longer recommend this app to anyone. I will be taking my subscription money elsewhere and uninstalling at the end of my current billing cycle."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization is brutal"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It use to be great, now they are forcing pro subscription for just basic features. Understand that a payment for app development is needed but a one-off cost would suffice for basic features (you can now only add 3 expenses per day for free). Total greed from the developers and I hope they take a look at their pricing model and amend it asap otherwise the current 2.6 rating is only going to get lower."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Currently, it is not working good. It is showing wrong expenses data, kindly fix the bug. If you have not a good developer then please assign this task to me, I will resolve that issues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You need to pay now. Not cool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Quite stupid restrictions to add expenses per day for free use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app after the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy developers are now restricting free users to 3 inputs a day making it barely usable. Too expensive for such a simple concept, time to switch to a newer, cheaper app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be 5 stars. The recent update to limit to 3 expenses per day was a complete surprise with no notification to users who have been using this product for years. Such a disappointment! The app no longer scales now for using it for group trips where you generally add expenses at the end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible way to monetize by limiting transactions and not giving loyal users a heads up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy!!!! moving to other apps. 5 transaction per day is too much to bear with"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is great but it keep asking money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for a good while now, and it has been an amazing way to track expenses and bills. However the recent updates make the app interaction literally useless. The basic features of the app should be left for normal users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent feature is worse..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gareeb salon kuch aur krlo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. However recent changes limiting four expenses a day, with 10 second 'pause' between, has ruined my experience with it. Would no longer recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app that charges for simple calculation. Looking for better alternatives. Worst part is it would allow you to just add 3 expenses per day in the basic version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses allowed in 1 day. That's terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be good until they started charging and increased limits..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier the app was best of all for spliting the expenses but now it has limited the transactions and that also showing 10 seconds add.. This is very bad 👎.. It's very annoying and there prices for premium subscription is also very high i request to please do something or else you will lose the users shifting to others apps.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently became the worst app by allowing to add only three expense in a day with 10 sec ads after each expense and after that ask to buy pro plans to continue."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Probably time to quit splitwise after all these years now. This app is gonna lose more money instead of making money by putting restrictions on adding expenses. Atleast the limit should be a sensible number like 10 free per day and with ads after that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Upgrading to Splitwise Pro has negatively impacted your experience over the past 6-7 years. I hope you reconsider and bring back the previous features, such as the ability to add an unlimited number of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used splitwise for years, but will switch to a competitor that does not cost anything anymore. It's useless for me now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice one 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version allowing only 3 expenses maximum per day after watching a video basically killed any convenience this app has over a shared Google sheet. Useless and annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number of expenses a day? This is a huge joke! Splitwise got greedy and it now s%%%% a%%"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Complicated app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was great but is now rendered useless by paywall. I wouldn't mind seeing some ads now and then if the number of entries per day wasn't limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they started the paywall after drawing in a lot of users. Now it's annoying that you have to pay to enter more than 3 entries a day. Ads are annoying as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable amount of transactions per day on the free plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update sucks. Buying the PRO version should give additional useful features, instead they've removed/limited basic features of the app itself for the non-PRO users. Switching to free alternatives, toodaloo!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why are guys charging now ? I have been using splitwise for nearly 8 years and sad to know it is no longer free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be an awesome app before latest changes of 3 transaction per day limit. I'd have paid for lifetime option though."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally disappointed with new features, it is not allowing to add expense. I understand you wanted to promote subscriptions but this with approach you are losing customers. Workaround :: you could have used ads to generate revenue instead of limiting user experience and losing customer base. I will be UNINSTALLING APP LIKE MANY OTHERS since it is no longer useful. I cannot add 2/3 expense per day. This app was helpful but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app which i have never used, to make split its showing ads after 4 expenses added, off after that asking for subscription for splitwise pro waste of money, better we can seqrch for similar apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extorting money from users with the latest feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"You can add only 3 expenses in a day which is a horrible way of pushing people to buy their pro version. Also, to make matters worse, their pro version is an expensive subscription instead of a small one time payment. Like bro...if I had so much money for a splitwise pro subscription, I wouldn't be splitting these bills. Lmao."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing! The interface is so user friendly, amazing experience and easy to use add friends. The monthly premium is too high but besides that it is amazing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No wonder this app is losing its rating. Atleast add an option to enter expenses after watching an ad. There is a hard stop after adding 4 expenses. It is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they want you to move to premium and will block the amount of times you can log something on. For such a simple tool I'll look somewhere else. Used the app for many years so it's very annoying to see this development. Half the premium features are unnecessary."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bro recent feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the friend group doesnt fight (as much anymore). thanks splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and suddenly I can't add an expense without viewing an obtrusive 10 second ad for the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible since they've implemented 3 transaction limit that too with 10 seconds annoying ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything was going perfectly until the ridiculous price of the full version was announced. What insulting price gouging. Most people would be willing to pay like a dollar a month, not these exorbitant rates. They're going to lose subscriptions and jeopardise their app rating. Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be so convenient and user friendly, unfortunately after the 10 sec ad for forcing you to subscribe to pro is very irritating.It is very terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Goodluck with your terrible decision; Had been using your app since years. Will leave it far behind as soon as I find an app with unpaid basic functionalities. The idea that a simple bill-splitting app can serve you as a business to make money (with your model) is stupid. There will be equally good alternatives sooner or later."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I once loved this app, but the restrictions on free users are absolutely prohibitive and I have mixed feelings (mostly negative) about the cost of a pro account (40.45 USD / year) converted from my country's local currency. That the change was implemented without warning is just adding insult to injury. Sorry, but I will likely leave this app soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I would have loved to give a 5 star for this app since I have been using it from many years and has helped me a lot. Now that they have introduced a limit per day and a paid version, I am no more interested in this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app always asking for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I honestly considered getting the Pro version before they decided to implement the transaction limits on the Free version. I no longer plan on using this app. I can take ads, if that'll help y'all. Yall are not doing yourself any favors by holding back basic features like search and currency exchange behind a pay wall, and now a transaction limit?? Are you serious? This once delightful app has turned into a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The shittification process of this app is really the worse. Adding useless 10s for the free version to push for the premium one is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become useless after they have implemented 10 sec ads for adding every transaction and restricted upto adding 3 transactions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I recently updated the app with high hopes for an enhanced experience, but the new feature restricting users to only three expense entries per day is a significant letdown. This limitation hinders the app's practicality, especially for those who need to track numerous expenses throughout the day. The previous version allowed for more flexibility and this change feels like a step backward. I hope the developers reconsider or provide an option to customize the entry limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update is horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They thought monetizing a feature that is so basic and replaceable will be a good idea. To the downfall of Splitwise 🥂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying to act oversmart. The new feature of just adding 3 transaction per day is horrible. Just for the sake of regular purpose the subscription charges are horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, but now they decided to add a limit on how many expenses can be added a day. I add expenses periodically and adding a limit of 3 expenses per day makes this app useless to me now. Personally, I would be fine with waiting for ads before adding an expense if that helps support the app. Worst part - there was no communications whatsoever to users beforehand and they even doubled down saying ""unnecessary communication"""
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app keeps on asking for updating to pro..I don't want to ,stop bullying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update is too bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Add value to your users to get premium subscriptions, breaking basic usage and selling the basic experience as a premium is shady."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Would be great to have tablet mode support"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable in the free tier. Switching to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent limited transactions is a bad update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This monthly subscription business model for an app we use on an ad-hoc basis won't work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently they are forcing people to buy pro version and put a limit of 3 entries per day without any prior notification."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ever since the last update they have killed the app. The limit of 3 expenses per day is ridiculous when the only option is a pricing plan that makes zero sense. I personally use groups with the same 6-8 people. Expecting each of us to pay 40 euros per year is just unreasonable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and Essential app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this App for over 10 years now. Yes, I had been using the free version. It's completely fine to monetize the app, but to limit the number of expenses and a time delay for adding the expenses in the free version to essentially force the users to upgrade to PRO is a very bad move. Reduce the monthly price to <2$ and I'll subscribe. Keep making it difficult to use the free version and I'll gladly uninstall and find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Entry limit is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to absolutely love this app. The pro version offered cool features, but I preferred to watch ads since I don't need all of those features. Then they limited the free version to 3 expenses pretty day, making it not only pointless for me, but I can't convince friends to use it either. They had something good, but after that I'm gone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Jumped on the bandwagon of trying to extort a paid subscription out of users by spamming timed ads at users during every interaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years with no issues. Now forget it. Can only list 3 expenses per day or you have to pay? No thank you - no longer using splitwise Download OurFlat instead which offers even more features outside of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greer ruining a perfectly good app, really sad to see. All functionality is essentially gone unless you pay for the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was an amazing app but the 3 expenses per day cap for the free tier warranted this rating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added very daily small transaction limit for free tier (also a wait between txns). For someone like me who looks at credit card bill and does transactions every couple months this makes the app unusable. Make the pro tier better if you want people to subscribe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor free experience, now with Max 3 and required ad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, but now almost unusable without paying. Too expensive imo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful, it used to be free and now they wanna charge 3.99 per month for the great pleasure of inputing more than 4 things per day. Instant delete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used the app a few times to split trip expenses over the years. Now it won't even let me add an expense and just wants me to pay an exorbetant monthly/ yearly fee to use the app. The monthly fee is more than a monthly Netflix subscription or spotify in my country. For something that has so little functionality, really? I'd rather just go back to my excel spreadsheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst feature of limiting transactions to 3 per day. Cannot imagine developers being so petty to give core feature of this app for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very buggy sign up and password reset"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and so convenient for splitting bills! Love this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be one of the best for recording transactions be it solo, or group, but the new payment model requiring us to pay for even adding transactions, also limiting the no. Of daily transactions has drastically ruined the experience of using this app. Creators, please revert back to how it was originally."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app more then 2 years but now it's not allowing to add expanses due to limit. Hoping the team will work on it make it available free or changes the subscription price to moderate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so handy when in a group situation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now you have to pay a monthly fee to use it if you want to add more than a couple of costs per day. What a shame. Saying goodbye to this app forever. Back to the (free) calculator app I go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely unusuable now that the app demands a pro account after few transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is nothing but harrasment for the users ..Its time this app is shut down for this absurd policy ...moving out of this to a better alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update ruin the app, i am going to search for alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the very basic features of app behind a paywall? A big NO."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable app due to rubbish subscription model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Free limit too low."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding restrictions to basic features like adding expenses is not acceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this for years but the sudden implementation of timers and transaction limits makes it useless. The paid tier is too expensive for most casual users and is completely useless, especially since everyone in the group would need to have it for it to work like before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads. Hate the app now. Time to shift to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever. Do not install. Plus you'll have to pay to use the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible decision by Splitwise team to make limits for expenses. Blocking a basic feature for getting some amount is not the good way. And I wish Advance RIP to Splitwise. Dont worry.. People wil switch/find another apps soon. All the best team😏😏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version crippled to the point of unusability. Used to be a great app but now you're limited to 3 transactions per day, forced to watch ads and there's an annoying 10 seconds delay on each transaction. Our entire social and family group has been using it for years - but now we'll look for something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful when away with a group of any size!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The push to get into the paid version of the app is extremely obnoxious. Will uninstall as soon as I finish my current trip and will look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The junk limit split wise has put on adding expenses and compulsorily watching 10 sec video everytime I try to add expense is useless and irritating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good bye.. your subscription charge for simple tool is super expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worthy. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update sucks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Switched to other app, because they have a very high subscription now. Revenue is important but basic function should be free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stay away from this app. They will change the terms on you without any notice or warning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They changed from unlimited adding of expenses to just 4 per day, unless we buy pro. Deserves so many 1 star. Will have to switch to alternatives or just be use Google sheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just another example how greed can completely destroy a decent app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app with good features, until the daily transaction limit is introduced. Basically, it only works for paid customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"very good but not funtastic. pro costs money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"they have a right to monetize but this is not the way. after many years, I switch to other solution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad practice: without warnings they implemented a free tier which allows to add only up to 3 expenses per day per user. 3 is not enough to be useable. There are similar apps and of this doesn't change I'll be forced to leave to another app. Premium pricing is too high for such a simple app. Edit: now they even added a 10 sec timer before you can add an expanse in the free tier. Free tier is unusable with 3 entries per account and the 10 sec timer. I will switch to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A wonderful app from last 7- 8 years , killed by the greediness of the developer, should have used a different approach rather than creating pay walls at each step and charging soo high for features which many apps provide for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app not even in single use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great expense tracker app. But due to recent restrictions it becomes worthless/useless. I would have rated 0 if there was any option for that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow this app was just killed. It will surely go into the history books as the worst management decision ever. Road to 1.0 star 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good and nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent group account app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star after you made the silly change. Deleting the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Really impressed 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"solo puedes meter tres gastos con la versión gratuita. hasta siempre Split! fue un placer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It seems every company wants the share in the subscription based business world. As people have a subconscious feeling of satisfaction while buying/ subscribing a service. Fortunately people do realize where the worth of their money is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update allows to add only 3-4 expenses per day... that's just stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was 5 stars, but as everyone else is saying - recent limit of 3 transactions per day makes it unusable. And the pro version is too much, I'd consider to pay a small amount, but not this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for many years but the newest update forced me to move on. Free version is absolutely unusable thanks to the expense limit per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"new pricing model makes app useless for casual trip users. Very bad example of broken trust with the usesrs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app, but now that it has lengthy full screen ads between adding expenses and a miniscule max number of daily expenses I will never say a word in its favour ever again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant when on group trips. Keeps you up to date with what has been spent and who was involved in the expense. No more bits of paper and the headache at the end of thevtrip ensuring all expenses have been accounted for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing wrong information Not calcuating individual expenses properly. Lot of bugs in the system"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was 5 star to me till yesterday! Latest App update Sucks while limiting the basic features!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a brilliant app until they got greedy and devised this toxic method to generate revenue where you're only allowed to add 3 expenses a day. Sorry, but that's not how this works and the fees are ridiculously high for basic, intermittent usage. Uninstalling this now and looking for an an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be amazing but they put limit and brought ad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number of transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to just few entries is really nav"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing to sesterce."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day? Bad move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really great to record transactions and keep accounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad yi and so many ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app for trip with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 sec delay with 3 transactions daily limit. might as well go back to my notepad for keeping track of everything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a really good app, but lately the push to get you to purchase the Pro version have been aggressive. You have to wait 10 seconds between posting each transaction, and you only have a limited number of transactions per day. More like SplitDUMB!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"cuts you off from posting too many transactions in one day making it useless if you have multiple transactions in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Old UI was good and intuitive. 😔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid app limiting number of entries now. UNINSTALL."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have introduced a cap on number of expenses you can add per day on the free version. Not happy will need to look for another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding extra features using a paid subscription is understandable but hiding the core functionality behind a paywall is just ridiculous. Made the app unusable untill you pay for the the subscription. Switching to something else now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I hate this app too much. I cannot add over 4 expenses in one day. Greedy app asking for pro memebership. Giving addvertisement to install this app after adding every single expense. I wish I could give 0 star. Never use this useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was an excellent app until they decided to thrust premium membership down their patrons neck. Understand that they have to monetize they platform but they could have subtly persuaded the customer to select premium on his own will (say, by showing ads, introducing trial premium subscriptions and enticing customers to stick with or charge a fraction in the beginning and gradually increase it- 149 a month is too much) So... Thanks for your services thus far.... Good bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fan, but basic features are gone and limited on daily basis which is insane. Gonna switch to something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years, now unusable without the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to add your expenses. No thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad decision of putting the limit of maximum expense... This is how an app destroys itself..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but the latest update ruined it. Can't believe you have to pay to use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for many years now, this month they started pushing more on getting a paid account with an ad every expense, and a ridiculous expense limit per day. So I didn't mind paying the price for subscription since I've been using it for so long. Plus I thought I'd get some extra benefits. Well, the charts pretty much suck and the interface lacks any basic functions as filtering by more than one category or even category group, sort, time range select etc. I would write more but"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the recent update that limits basic functionality, i would not recommend this app to anyone. Have been using the app for about 2 years and it's been great for group trips and flatting, but I will be going back to the trusted pen and paper approach now that I am limited to so few transactions without paying for the (frankly extortionate for what it adds) Pro subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this for years and loved it. But the creators suddenly decided to take advantage of their users by limiting the number of expenses you can add in a day. They are pushing their users to pay for pro. This is bad practice. I'm removing the app and will be looking for a new service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gone to s***. Developer greed, pure and simple."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"By making it only useful for those who will buy its premium version is just a very bad decision.. Please, bring it to its old form.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Same complaint as many of the other recent reviews here. Only 4 entries limit per day for the free version of the app is just laughably bad user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to have a great free version. Now you get ads after every expense, with a max of 4 per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, now it only lets us add 3 expenses a day, before asking us to pay for the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They constantly make the free version worse and worse to push you towards their overpriced pro offering. Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to budgeting app, now I can only add a couple of expenses a day. Need to find an alternative. As I cannot add more than 5 a day without going premium..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great till recent update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not happy with 3 transaction per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allows you to add one expense a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great program!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have made the free app useless, one can not expect all 10 people to have a paid version in the group and each time you create a group you can not ask everyone to buy this subscription to add transaction. They have hit the very basic functionality and made this app useless. They shhave tried advertisement or extended features as paid instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"became worst in recent update.. time to move to new app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing, clear up all hassles, and really easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app until they added a DAILY expense limit. Are you kidding me? I've been using it for YEARS and I think this is ridiculous. Good riddance, Splitwise, it was nice but you are not that special."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash now that you're limited to a couple expenses a day. Don't bother"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"because of limitations and subscription cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst application, full of ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This is now useless without premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app ruined by corporate greed. You want to sell pro, sell pro with new things that add value. Only 3 expenses per day ? What is the freaking point of this app if I have to any way note down all my expenses during a trip to finally add them at once. You want me to shift to pro ? I'd better shift to something else or remove the app entirely 😄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's something wrong with the app. Wrong calc of amount set off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a splitwise user for more than 10 years. This new premium thing has ruined the app completely. Like how Google is synonymous with Search, Splitwise is (was) synonymous with expense recording. The developer has completely lost the moment and their competitors will seize the opportunity served to them on a platter. Goodbye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What's this limit on adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the latest update there is a limit to the expenses you can fill in each day, unless you get a paid subscription. Untill this change the app was super convenient, now it's useless. We will be switching to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cringe app. ""You've reached maximum number of expenses today?"" I get this after added 3 expenses here you guys are blocking the basic functionality of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using your app for a couple of years, the new upgrade is just making the free version completely useless Too bad you don't offer a one time payment, sorry to tell you this, but the product you offer is really not worth 3€/month Be careful, all your users will go away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 expenses without paying them 5$ a month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good, will now never use again as trying to force people to pay for a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This doesnt work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The change the overly restrictive paywall has ruined this app. Used to be an absolute dynamite expense tracker. But the extreme cost for the Pro outweighs the benefit particularly as everyone has to pay for pro individually"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are forcing to subscribe for 3€ per month. Ridiculous price for such a simple app that just makes divisions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was really good, but now you get a pop up trying to get you to have the pro version every time you add an expense, and eventually it stops you being able to even use the app as you can't dismiss it. It's awful, the pro is far too expensive for something I don't use that frequently.. I can't afford to pay for absolutely everything I use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience now if you don't upgrade"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good until now, they want to charge 6,5 EUR per month now! Not acceptable. Will find another app. Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall aggressiv aufgezwungen, nach zwei Einträgen ist schluss und man muss auf ein Pro Abomodell upgraden. Dass Abomodelle immer häufiger werden, ist kein Geheimnis. So aggressiv vorzugehen, nachdem das Produkt in seiner Basisfunktion lange kostenlos war, ist eine Frechheit. Ermöglicht doch wenigstens einen normalen Kauf."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've using it for a long time but recently the 10s ad to add an expense, a daily limit for expenses has ruined the whole experience. If it was one time Pro payment I was willing to pay it but a subscription model for Pro doesn't make sense. Looking into alternatives now. Will be leaving this Splitwise platform soon. Ruined potential."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app if you don't buy the pro. Annoyances: 1. Everyone needs to buy pro to make it useful, for a group of 10 friends, that's 40*10 = 400 GBP in total 2. You can't add more than 3 transactions in the free version? What is it point of it then? 3. Even for these 3 transactions you need to wait once every 10 seconds to add another?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it's useless without a recurring subscription!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of expenses is dastardly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 4 update in a day is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New subscription model is horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Kinda sad that we lost out on the big features because we cannot pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent features of adding only 3 transaction per day (including friends, groups all) with 10sec ad in between makes the App useless. So long Splitwise !!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was my go-to app for all trips and groups but with the update and the need to pay a recurring amount, when the app is used maybe just once in two months, it costs way more than the time saved or convenience is worth. Just use chat GPT, a free alternative that breaks things down with just a little more time needed to type."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Understand the ads, but timer and limits are not for me!! Previous version before the update was the tool for group expenses, looking for alternatives now!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 transaction per day for free users, what a nonsense. Atleast show ads and unlock!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The day when they decided to put a 3 transaction limit per day is when I decided to switch to some other app for bill splitting. When someone is on a trip, an average person will have at least 10 transactions to enter per day & they are limiting this to 3!! And their premium subscription amount is also pretty high & not worth it. Thanks for the service so far, but we will not continue to use this app anymore.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for sometime now for free. I'm all for paying Pro features, but 2,000 pesos per year is too much. Disney Plus subscription is worth the same. It doesn't make sense that this app has same prize as Disney Plus."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously, 2 expenses allowed per day on the free version. It is not a free app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the amount of expenses you can add to a small amount a day unless you pay makes this app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for 2 years +. Really great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible app after update... I am using this app for 3 years and maybe I wolud try pro version but it is very expensive so unfortunately now I am searching for a new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great but the transaction limit and time delay has made the app unusable. Other free alternatives exist so not worth paying for pro sadly. Sorry to lose it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing but the current business model has completely ruined it. Unusable without pro version now and £40 a year for a minor utility app is ridiculous. I'd pay a few £s a year to get the old free Splitwise if that were an option. Instead it's going to get uninstalled and I'll switch to one of the myriad other good apps delivering this service for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Deleted and moved to settleup. I'd used this app for over 10 years. The free version has recently been limited so strongly, it's now useless. You have a 10s delay and can only add three transactions a day, I usually do mine in bulk. Settleup has an ad shown every few transactions, which is acceptable to keep the service free. Bye Splitwise.. you should probably rethink your income strategy as you've alienated the majority of your users. There are plenty of apps to replace you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly this app requires you to pay to use it. They implemented a limit of 3 transactions per day. I get that they need to earn money, buy an ad-supported version would have been better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I been using splitwise for a couple of years now, but with the new update it is just terrible. The app was so great, that I would have agreed to pay a one time reasonable fee, but never a recurring $40 annually fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined like many others by greedy monetization, ads would have been fine but limiting expenses to 3 per day is very questionable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic things like adding expense to an existing group you shouldn't make only for premium. I loved this app, but now I hate it. Definitely need to find an alternative. From a developer's point of view, making money on these applications is good only but you need to give at least basic functionality for free. Good luck with the downfall now. I really hope you guys see this and do some appropriate action."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Long time user but the new limit on daily expenses renders it useless for me. Will find another app to use with my family and friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If I could give 0 star, I would."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you put a limit on expense addition. It is the most basic feature people use the app for ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has just been ruined by greed. Imagine trying to charge a monthly fee for what is essentially just a basic calculation and a running tab. Your product isn't that good that someone else can't replicate for free, or at the very least, a one time fee. But MONTHLY?!? haha I strongly suggest that everyone look elsewhere before downloading."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for a long time, but since the update creating a cap on expense inputs (3-4 per day) it has lost all use. It used to be a 5 star but now is less than 1. Dont use this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using it for 5 years, but greed increases with popularity, listen your app is very basic it has very very very basic logic, and you are charging a lot of money for subscription and your cheap tricks to make us buy your subscription is filthy I have settled all groups and uninstalling your app there are other options too in market."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously was 5 stars. I have been using this app for years for my household and it has been ruined by now everything being behind a paywall essentially. My family and friends used this for everything, and now most things are locked behind the pro version. If you want people to pay for the app, shouldn't have a free option. You are ruined a wonderful app with extra features for a subscription model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it sucks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It will soon loose userbase..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously 5 stars. Update: Dec 2023 They have limited the number of expenses you can enter to 3/day. Unfortunately, they have now overdone the monetization."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for helping split costs when out with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expenses limit per day!! I guess it's good bye then."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app but subscribtion is unnecessary just for soo basics thing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"❌ Desde que se tiene que pagar por todo, ya no vale la pena. Ej: pagar por poner gastos No recomendada"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for nearly a decade and it has been incredibly useful. However, the new daily limit on number of expenses is too restrictive and to effectively lose all functionality overnight is a terrible user experience. I'm uninstalling and looking elsewhere as to not support bait-and-switch tactics."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this for more than 5 years. But after recent update even basic features are not available in the free version. Better add advertisement for free version. Switching to different app for now. Also 999/- per year for the pro version seems expensive for the purpose it serves."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously great app, now you can't add more than 5 expenses a day and have to wait through a 10 second ad every time you add an expense. They want $5 A MONTH to do basic balance splits....Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app since I downloaded it for a trip with friends. However during a recent update where they make you watch a 10 second ad after every entry and you can only make 3 entries a day unless you buy an unfair premium version I uninstalled and won't be using anymore. Fingers crossed they realize it was a mistake and undo it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Love the app. Can you add a filter by people option?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting add expense is terrible and frustrating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't bother anymore. They now limit the number of expenses added for free users :/ Now you have to wait a time limit for every expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the experience by adding limit to the expenses you can add. Absolute horrible decision and forcing also"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Certain limit is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I want to uninstall this app. The recent update is so worst. Now we cannot add more expenses in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The 4-expense-per-day limit pretty much makes the app useless, where it used to be super good :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sometimes makes mistakes with calculation, which defeats the purpose of the whole app. The free version is now so hamstrung as to be unusable. Used to be good for basic things, but wouldn't recommend it in it's current state."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"La app era buenísima hasta que ahora solo se puede agregar 3 gastos y luego te cobra, lo que la hace completamente inútil 😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 4 expenses. It requires a pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The usage limit of free plan is too low. It is okay to wait 5-10 seconds for ads but limiting adding expense to 3 per day is rediculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is completely useless now due to transaction limits. Will be deleting and moving to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now a days allowing only to add 3 or 4 expenses in a day... Pathetic... You are showing ads that's fine... But restricting to only 4 is not fair.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So many limitations now. With every update this is becoming worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free plan have lot of limitations, axio doesn't have that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update basically makes this app useless. Ads, transaction limits and no receipt scan feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app is actually great. But the price for ad-free is just absurd. Should not be a subscription model for this type of app. There are not that many improvements over the past year or so to warrant perpetual financial benefit. New changes to push the pro version are quite aggressive - a 6 second delay before you can enter an item. Annoying, and probably time to look for an alternative. Again, I would happily pay a small subscription fee or $30 once off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expense limit of 4 per day ja just unethical. You want to show me an add, show me an add. But to not allow to add expenses without a premium doesn't make sense. No one will take your premium. There are other alternatives. Fools running a business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made it worst by putting the per day limit. Atleast make the decisions responsibly to keep your current users connected."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update which limits the no. of time of adding expenses, has made the app worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is now a rubbish app, get rid of it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I purchased the pro version, but the app didn't even give me pro features, and the amount is also deducted. This app is a scam."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good job ruining your app. I'm the same as everyone else below, I've used this app for years and now it's absolutely useless. The one star is generous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"almost usless without pro, there is a daily limit of expensas and a 10-second want before you add each expense. look for an alternative or use Google sheets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically forcing us to buy splitwise pro 👎👎👎👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expenses a day maximum. Overpriced subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally killed the free tier. The app sucks with all the ads and unnecessary restriction now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad practice. You cannot limit users like this. Gonna uninstall after many years and install another one. See you NEVER."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used splitwise for years but now they add limit for daily expense (max 3/4 per day!!) and you should pay if you want add more. Really bad!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gradually getting more and more hostile to free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the recent update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I find the app useful and handy, I've even introduced multiple friends to it. Though I wish there was a calculator function so I don't end up using my normal calculator or borrowing someone else's phone EDIT 29-12-2023 :: Changed from 4 stars to 1 star, as the limitation of 3 entries a day in addition to a 10 second banner/ad has rendered the app useless to me. I will be finding a new app and no longer recc'ing it to friends/family. IF pro was a 1-off purchase I'd be ok, but not a sub"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be good but now limits the number of times you can add expenses and has an ad everytime you try to add expenses because they want you to purchase their pro option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed my review due to the update rendering the app unusable without payment. Since the update, the the paywall makes no sense. It's unusable for the free version. It needs a one off payment, or an ad version. But the monthly cost is far too high considering it doesn't have much going in term of benefits for that monthly cost. I will now be looking at alternatives thst take a one off payment for a calculating service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"recent update aggressively blocks basic features for paid subscriptions. That's Real cheap Splitwise team!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent change to inputs, 4 a day is the limit for free account when previously it was unlimited. I will HAPPILY give money for a one time purchase to get a premium app, but im not doing a subscription. Great app, and i get they need to make money, but spitting in my face isnt the way to do it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app but now it has a limit of expenses you can add per day, they force you to wait for the ad, expecting you get the PRO version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall is a annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You've completely ruined the app. Instituting maximum numbers of daily expenses (only 4!) and forcing me to watch 10 second ads between each one isn't going to strongarm me into buying premium... it's going to cause me to abandon the app altogether. What an absolute shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most recent update of only three transactions per day is going to let other apps take over. Clearly, splitwise isn't the goto anymore when I'm thinking of convenience. Good riddance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of putting up the number of transactions of 3 a day and changing the process abruptly is terrible!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont use this app. Free Version doesnt work now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It became completely useless, since you are allowed only 4 entries per day. Who would pay 30 bucks for something which you use few times year?! Will be uninstalled and replaced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since it moved to only 3 expenses a day, it's useless and makes it more confusing for users having to bundle multiple transactions together! Bring back unlimited, or at least 10-15 minimum."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not helpful anymore, try other apps. Asking for pro to even do basic functions it's totally opposite to the purpose of app. Restricted expenses that too only 3? Lmao what a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am outraged. I never write reviews but I'm advising you not to download the app. At the beginning it was awesome, it did exactly what it was supposed to do: you enter expenses and it will split them between friends. Now there is a paywall and unless you pay you need to wait 5 SECODS for every expense you add, which could be acceptable, but you have a like 5 expenses limit. For people who don't need many features it just a joke. I was a huge fan of the app, now I'm moving to Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Number of expenses per day is now limited on free tier. If you are searching for a free expense splitting app choose something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"makes life more convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No lifetime payment option and this company chose subscription. Unbelievable. Apparently they removed comments as well cuz there is no way this app is still at 4.3 today."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app till they started a limit of adding expenses per day and are charging ridiculous amount of money just for premium of an app that splits balances we manually add with all details, so basically charing 1000 rs a year for app that just does a little complex addition and subtraction. Not cool... Atleast keep 10 or 15 free add expenses per day. Or close the app... 😮‍💨😏 We will look for a better alternative 😛😝"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent Changes that are added, limiting the transactions that can be added to 3 per day and 10 second ads pushing people towards using Pro is very detrimental towards the user experience. They made it unusable for free users and the pro doesn't have any one-time payment option but a subscription which is greedy for such a basic app. Switching to other alternatives now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now it's partially unusable for that it is. On top of this there isn't a way to pay for the usual features back. It's a total pro version or (now) terrible free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Completely unusable without premium. Splitwise was a great option for you and your friends, partner, family, housemates to get. Easy to use and quite a lot of people were on it. It is now unusable on the free plan, you can only add FOUR expenses per day. Absolutely ridiculous, I'll delete the app and tell everyone to not use it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for almost 10 years, it's been great. Now they hide their previously free features behind a paywall. You do get a couple expenses to add for free, but have to wait for a 10 second ad before using. This change was t communicated, and the pro/paid version is ridiculously overpriced. I'm sad to say I'll have to look for something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive version for basic usage. Keep a low premium for basic tier and be done with it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand that the company may need to make money but limiting to 3 expenses per day just making the app useless for anyone who use it regularly. Will be looking at other options now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this to keep track of bills due for the family for years. The new 3 per day limit is garbage and the app ain't worth paying $40 a year for. Time to find a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The developer puts everything behind a paywall - now you can't even add more than 3 expenses per day. This is the most basic function, yet it's behind a pay wall. It is ridiculous. Bye bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't believe that now there's a daily limit of 3 expenses plus I have to wait 10 seconds in-between each of them. This app is basically useless unless you pay, which of course I won't do as there are many other apps to do the same job. I am very disappointed and I will uninstall the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used splitwise a lot, but the current limit of 4 entries per day are too little since I use once a month to add my bills. I would like to subscribe to Pro, but the price is to steep for my local currency. Please consider localizing your prices or adding more affordable subscription tiers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An amazing app, but they've gotten greedy. Now to use the most basic features you need to pay. And i would gladly pay for a one time purchase, but a subscription is ridiculous. Time to move to alternatives apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since using 2 3 years, but now its restricting to do all activities.. Its now becoming a paid app. Go and try some other app don't install this. 😇"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 5 transactions a day, seriously? This app was for convenience. People aren't paying money for subscription of dating apps you think they will pay for this. Good luck with new update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 5 expenses daily?.... Really bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly requires me to pay monthly. Will find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app by limiting to 3 expenses a day and putting it behind a subscription. Use tricount or something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I have to Pay R100/month. Been using it for years... Cheers splitwise. Will find something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use it with free version now, Splitwise converted into fully paid app, pity. It used to be one of my fav travel app. Time to search for another"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best application for tracking payments and splitting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They now allow only 4 entries per day and force you to upgrade to the paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became useless and wiseless with the recent updates. Focus on mass uninstall 🥲"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be good, but ads just destroyed this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really bad experience of making very basic features paid & the 10 second timer is horrible. There's no way anyone is paying a 5 bucks subscription for a mere expense splitting app. Deleted mine & got my friends to delete their account as well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's been an amazing app until they force u to pay now, guess most of the users will just find an alternative now. Bye Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app became useless without paying ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible changes made to the app. Time to look for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a great app, but trying to monetize by locking basic features behind a pay wall is just plain stupid. It's no wonder I'm seeing so many 1 star reviews now. Why would anyone use this app if you can only add 4 transactions a day. 🙏 Think about your users or lose it all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The free version of this app used to be 5 stars, but now there's a limit of 4 expenses per day and you get an ad before each one. I use it once a month to split groceries with my partner, I don't need the pro version. I only use the very basic functions, and now I have to spit 10 expenses over 3 days. Not a good way to get more people on board, Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed that they've put excessive limitations on the app to the point where it's unusable unless you pay for the Pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be great but, they have paywalled to an unusable level. And I would be willing to pay but what they are asking for is ludicrous, as if it was a streaming service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too limited usage for free user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Updating to 2 stars: Been user for many years. I don't like that I can't upload the receipts from the app anymore. Or that after 3 expenses in a group you need to wait many seconds to input a new one. Seems that the idea is to make it very inconvenient so you buy the pro, it might fire back, as a years long user I now feel compelled to use alternatives or simply not use it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst business practice I have ever seen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Maximum of 4 expenses per day?? Really???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Due to recent updates such as limiting expenses to 3/day and forcing 10seconds wait times to post an expense, this previously great app is now pretty much unusable unless you pay for the Pro version. Extremely disappointed in the developers for destroying their app to push Pro subscriptions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Barely usable without paying, and the price is absolutely extortionate. Really sad to see this app go down the drain."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My experience with Splitwise has been marred by its restrictive features and a disappointing push for paid services. Basic features that should be included are arbitrarily limited, forcing users to opt for a premium subscription. It's disheartening to see a once-helpful app prioritize monetization over user satisfaction. The decision to charge for what should be standard functionality leaves a bitter taste, and I can't help but feel that Splitwise is more focused on squeezing money out of users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"wait on ads to do your expenses? 5 expense limit? there are plenty other apps that do the same thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really handy and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is totally useless after recent changes forcing to buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great Tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable for free users now with a daily limit on expenses. Trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense number limitation for free version. Pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too complicated. Too cumbersome for advantage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has become unusable with the 3 transactions per day limit. It was a fantastic app while it lasted. Not anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the forced ad experience to buy premium before adding an expense messed it up also limited expenses can be added per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just disappointed after so many years that I used splitwise. Of course for the same reason that all other users mentioned. Adios splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting daily inputs to 2? I would pay you something to use it without limitations but certainly not 6 eur per month... It's vile that you do that to many users that have been with you for years. I will miss my family's purchase history but we will most definitely find an alternative and delete this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful, there are alternatives so use them. Greedy SOBs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, I don't recommend downloading it. The Interface is garbage and it keeps crashing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worse since they stoped allowing multiple expences without paying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Who will spend amount for such apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great way to keep track of expenses on group holidays"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful tactics now trying to push you into buying Pro. Caps the number of entries you can do per day and makes you wait in between. Absurd and bad business practice. Good for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become horrible ! You have to pay for everything. Not worth it anymore. There are several free apps that do same thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switching to another app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nowadays you got subscriptions for every little things, even a mobile calculator... This is greedy. For the record it's 3€/month and basically unusable on the free version. On my way to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was an amazing app but new updates mean mandatory wait times when adding any expense unless you subscribe to the pro version so it's become essentially unusable as a free app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has become super greedy. A normal splitting bills app has become such a nuisance that we just don't want to use it anymore. I am just looking for alternatives to switch to if they keep asking for money. I am not paying for Pro to just split bills, that's the stupidest thing ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Similar comments as other recent 1 star reviews since the last app update (late 2023). The 3 entries per day (free version) or the $40 per year subscription are ridiculous. Very disappointing pricing strategy. If unchanged, this is a potential death sentence for what is otherwise a great app for its large and loyal user base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until the last update that forces user to pay or wait. It killed the whole experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Current issue is that It is forcing indirectly to purchase pro version. I'm looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No se puede usar. Cuando añades 3 gastos ya no te deja añadir más sin pagar, la cual es una cantidad ridícula. Hay muchas apps alternativas."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate that u can only add 3 expenses per day without premium. Still gonna use the app though, cause I don't like the alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Instead of force users to subscribe to pro, perhaps can consider introduce ads like social medias nowadays...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app and might have promoted it quite a bit. I use the app sparingly. 3-4 times a year ranging from 2-7 days at a time. Primary use was to split expenses with friends when we went out for a holiday together. The pricing for the app is odd. Each of us needs to have a paid version even for basic use. Unless you are all willing to pay, skip the app. There are other apps that can do the job just fine. 3 transactions a day that too with a 10 second delay! I ain't returning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started putting a timer before every expense and put a limit on expenses per day. Are you kidding me? We used this for years and now they introduce such a hard paywall. Just gtfo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Doesn't make sense to pay for something I only use once in a blue moon. Would make sense if I used it all the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A good app which has lost all its sensibility and become the most shittiest app that has ever existed. Asking for money to use the app's basic functionality is just the start of this app starting to show that it doesn't care about customers anymore. Would not recommend anyone to use this. The app makers just want you to pay them so that you can track who owes you money - hilarious af."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limits are annoying. Had I knew this earlier I wouldn't start using. I'm okay to pay a 1 time fee, but paying monthly for this app is too much. I don't travel every month, so why should I pay monthly when I use this app once/twice a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor laggy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"annoying ads, makes it unusable. minimal transaction entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything asking to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible limitation on app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice way to ruin your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shame on your business model it's a wrost strategy I see ever for good user experience perspective"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but since they now force us to get pro version, it has become unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worthless app, money grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gone from hero to zero. The concept of paying itself is not shameful. The pricing structure and options as well as unpaid features are however, very appalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently added feature of adding only two expenses per day made this app useless. As when we go to trip or anywhere we will need to add more than 2 expenses per day and paying for such a basic feature is waste of money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor interface too many unnecessary ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for years, but they have recently started limiting the number of expenses you can add daily, and want some absurd amount for a subscription to bypass the limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They think they have invented some rocket science by charging such high subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I know it's tough to monetize an app like this, but the way the dev's have gone about implementing a paywall is horrendous. A daily limit of 3 transactions, each with a 10 sec wait? And for what? The 2/3 times per year that I'll use it to log group expenses? I'm moving on from splitwise to other established competitors like splid or tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years. It's quite annoying to ask payment for basic needs usage. The app doesn't allow more than 4entries per day. Planning to switch over if the revenue mandate for continues usage isn't revised. Hope the developers make a note of these requests and act on them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed and now only 4 transactions can be added per day for free version that too with advertisement. Time to move to other app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit for adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Have made life easy.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be great and they changed everything to force people to pay. Annoying. I'm going to settle every payments and delete it after."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible that user can add only 5 transaction per day. Can't purchase pro version for basic use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very very useful to split up our trip expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The 4 transaction limit was a really stupid move. Pointless app. Just stick with Venmo requesting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Has been great keeping track of my expenses but the recent update where there is an add after every expense and only a 4 expense per day limit has made me feel otherwise for the app and look for alternatives. Understandable the company needs to generate revenue and they still can go ahead with the ads but limiting users to 4 transactions a day is just a terrible move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Excellent job adding a paywall on the app. For basic trip plans, why would anyone take a subscription for month or year. Time to shift back to paper notes. Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 expense. This is not good as they create demand marketing via sample usage ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent 3 transactions daily limit is a bait and switch that does not respect the end users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad.. Worst decision to limit the expense per day and ads. Use MS Excel, instead of this..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Moving to a paid model for an app I use a few times a year is a deal breaker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would give zero stars if I could. Every single useful thing about this app has been shoved behind a ridiculously expensive pay wall - used to be the best app out there, will be deleting and using one of the many free options out there. Just another sickening case of blocking necessary features to make the app usable behind a paywall. Gross."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"tanking review as there is a 3 expense limit now. no longer worth using the app. will be looking for a better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good for expense management with friends group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now only let's you add 3 things a day and wait 10 seconds each time to try to get you to pay. If you want me to pay, give me additional features, not the features that used to be free and severely cripple me if I don't. This app is dead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has introduced a 3 expense daily limit on the free version - total waste of time now. Dont bother"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the pay wall now! Sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need pro account for more than 2 entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use with family and friends for trips and big ticket items"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added unskippable ads and split limits out of nowhere to try and get you to pay for premium - no notification at all. I'm looking into open source options like IHateMoney so enshittification doesn't happen to me again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Honestly 5 stars if they didn't limit number of expenses daily and charge $40/ year to remove the limit. You're not giving me anything I actually want in the pro version except removing an arbitrary limit on the basic functionality. I'd pay a one time fee for that but not a subscription that costs as much as a full featured budget solution. Very disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage that the free version isn't usable anymore. Show an ad or something, don't make it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits number of expenses added to about 5 a day. Would recommend a free one over this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Nevertheless ads and charging costs was the way to ruin the app. Well done!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was once a good app until the recent update to restrict 3 entries a day. Now abandoning it for free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduction of a £4/ month fee to be able to use this incredibly basic app is totally unjustifiable. Will now start using an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding wait time for free users are insane, I just have to find something else..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very handy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've moved everything behind a paywall and even institute a 10s waiting period to add an expense on the free version. I've used this app for years and loved it but will be finding a new solution moving forward. Such a pitiful way of forcing users towards the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I can only add a 3-4 expenses a day for free version. Not at all worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily entry limit makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rip splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using this app for years to manage expenses with friends, the Splitwise team decided to require a pro account without any notice for entering more than 3 transactions. Now the app is useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removed features without proactive communication, a money-grab rendering the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"settle up to be developed with more clarity ( mutual approval)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10s waits to input transactions is just pure dark design patterns. Maybe I would have considered a one-time fee, but definitely not now 🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing the payment for app for simplest features that can be implemented by a high school student. You got greedy, not very wise;)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would be a good app if it was a one time payment. Everything has to be a subscription nowadays. Sorry but no, I'd rather use an excel sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Неюзабельная бесплатная версия, ограничивают базовый функционал добавления расходов."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined the best experience of the app with a limit of 3 transactions per day Who will take this costly subscription of 149 per month that is equivalent to any OTT subscription. Now this became useless app so not going use anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good before the update now it keeps asking for premium when adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the amount of times you can add an expense per day in the new update is pathetic and stupid. Imagine creating an app and then blocking the core feature of it to get more money. There are better apps now, don't use this one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently implemented pro paywall is horrible. Uninstalled and change to other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed from free to use, to only giving you 5 expenses per day unless you pay 5usd per month. Won't use it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Spotify part 2, they don't have ads to show , so now they just stop you from adding transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Depois que ficou tudo pago nao vale mais a pena!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a longtime user, but now everything needs to be premium, searching transaction, max 3 expense per day.. Better off using another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version has become unusable after latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why the limit! You just ruined it for everyone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update limiting the number of expenses makes this app pointless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update is downright bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing and effortless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app tp settle the money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined a perfectly nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier it was an amazing app. Now even basic functionalities need premium access. Hope they reconsider this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was outstanding but now people can't use it because of limited entries. Now I started again my notes app in my android to write expenses as before. You took us back to old era. Now I am looking for alternate apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is very bad. Limits is killing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"as many others have recently pointed out, I'm a long time user and advocate for this app but sadly it's no longer of use. pro version is ridiculously expensive considering most streaming services cost less than half of what they're asking for. couldn't bring myself to give it one star since this has served me very well over the years and maybe they'll change their minds when they realize they *****d up and see people move on to other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"nobody is gonna spend money to track money for pro membership the restrictions make the app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Had it for years. Forced monthly subscription is bulls***. I would pay a one time fee for the app, not five dollars per month per subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not shove the pro version down our throats"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic way to try shifting free users to paid subscription for something that's supposed to be the core feature of the app. Looking for a way out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst decision to limit number of transactions and asking of a monthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You guys have to find better way to monetize. Limiting the addition of expenses every day is just stupid, I'm ready to watch ads. Not pay to add more than 4 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, 3 transaction limit per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New experience is pathetic! New transaction limit and 10 seconds gap just ruined it fully."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it was good till it enforced 4 transactions per day limit. greedy app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app completely by adding the daily limit. No use of this app anymore 😕. Need to find an alternative app. #notcoolsplitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"developers shooting themselves in the foot after making this a paid app. uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't do anything with this app without premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined by adding limits to daily use, what a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a great app that I used for many years, now they suddenly are pushing their paid version and have made the app useless with adds and limits on adding expenses. Going to find an alternative as soon as possible. Good luck with no users after this terrible business decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really good and the forecast festure is great for people being together from different places in different places!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App has not been consistent and now we have to pay to add expenses per day with out limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are less drastic ways to make money and still keep your userbase. Their current approach of limiting transactions to one per day makes it completely unusable for free users. This will just make users uninstall the app. I'll be completely ok with ads or even a one time payment. But as it is, you lost me as a user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"2 free transaction limit per day and a 10 second ad for your 2 more transactions with a lockout after kills the app. Way to completely kill a decent product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very limited number of transactions a day makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My review before uninstalling this app: They are missusing the trust and popularity they had gained but they are not smart enough to understand that this will end their App's life very soon. Please uninstall the App asap to teach them a lesson that they shouldn't have misused their users trust in favor of earning more money. This is just a stupid mistake that has total failure as the only way out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As everyone else has recently noticed, the free version of this app is no longer useful. Fortunately there are many new apps that have capitalized on this change, such as SplitMyExpenses, that are great alternatives!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad for limited expenses limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling this because of limiting the amount of expenses you can add per day behind a paywall. No point in using this app when lots of others fulfill the same need, and none of the paid features are really worth spending money on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses without buying pro membership makes the app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Their decision to introduce a maximum daily number of transactions was the worst decision ever made. Horrible user experience, I can only add like two expenses a day. Will definitely never pay to use a service that does not care about it's consumers at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such a bad experience with this app. Not going to use it after keeping a limit to transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app. we use it for family expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Exceptionally productive application ruined with its restrictions of limited entries in day. Should have let the funda functionalities remained untouched instead of ruining them by the name of pro subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The addition of a daily expense input limit for the ""free tier"" makes this essentially unusable. I've loved the app for years and years, but this is awful. While I don't support the limit at all and would much rather have more ads, 3 is an insanely low gate. You are not going to earn my money by giving me daily busy work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the perfect app for managing daily expenses but it's pretty useless now with the new fremium model. I can understand the 10 second delay but putting a limit on the daily transactions is hilariously absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now its time to uninstall this app as it started asking pro subscription even for adding expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"They have to use ads instead of limiting the number of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disturbed your stupid app With add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app. I am going to uninstall this app. Imposition of limit on expanse addition as well as stopping for ad of pro mode is pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 7 years. Unhappy with latest upgrade which limits the user to add certain expenses. No one has patience to wait for a day to add remaining expenses. So, Not sure what splitwise will get out of it. Ofcourse, Users will obviously switch to other apps for convenience. Pathetic !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit feature with wait time has ruined the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update simply sucks! I believe many users will be willing to pay a small one off fee as they would only use this a few times a year for travelling sake. But the subscription for amount of transactions we key in is stupid. Would definitely uninstall this!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be my default option to do the job, but they've gone so overboard with trying to force you into their paid offering it's become near unusable. The 10 second timer delay before putting in new expenses, the daily limits on new expenses, and the constant ad interstitials have become ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It seems mostly organized and does what I want it to do. I love that it can add up the different bills and then find out who still owes who money at the end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent app for maintaining expense records especially when travelling in large groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"perfect application for tracking expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"removed everything good for the sake of money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used splitwise for over 6 years now. But essentially gutting your free tier of the app and forcing users to pay for a subscription is pure idiocy. Implement whatever business model you want but at least notify users beforehand instead of springing it as a surprise. Poor user management. I'm switching to an alternative that isn't making me wait 10sec between adding transactions or letting me only add 3 transactions a day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing premium with a maximum number of 4 addition per day, out of nowhere. I'll keep it a month to see if they revert it, otherwise I'm back using triccount or an open-source alternative. Edit : It's been a while apparently, I just didn't use it much lately, so I reckon they won't change. Then I'm out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Updated version was worse in usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become a money grabbing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined a good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved using it before. But going to stop now. The app forces you to pay by restricting the number of expenses each person can add in"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After so many years you realised to ask for money after 3 entries?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tricount is much better and all for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro membership again and again and if you will not take then they will only let you add 5-6 expenses per day and will show you adds in between."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Setting up a limit on how many expenses one can add to make us pay? Seriously? Literally hampering the usability of app just to pry some money from your users? What's next?setting a limit on how much amount one can put in? I was fine with everything else until this. Holy hell. Already looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nasty and illogical restrictions added to the free version making it a pain in the arse to use. Yes they want to monetise but they are shooting themselves in the foot with these changes. Send a message - look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Try to arrange a loan facility on a split wise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is practically unusable unless you pay for pro! In base version, you get annoying ads and the ability to add only 3 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update is horrible. I have limited amount of entries per day and the subscription fee is atrocious. I'm tired of every single app and feature being a subscription. I am not paying, and I will not be using."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"should've made users watch ads, rather than the paltry 3 transactions per day limit. what you do can be replicated. so such a strict limit is only going to harm the app. not the users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"negative stars if possible. THREE expenses a day what kinda of asinine number is that? if they tried to bookkeep with their free tier they would have smashed their heads into a wall. go step on legos"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying, even basic features are now behind paywall, not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entry has ruined the app for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app but only 3 expense limit ruined it , should implement something like 10 expense for watching an ad kinda thing that way it would work out for both the parties"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app, now a bit less due to ads. If this will not change soon, I will find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience with free version. Play ads instead of limiting the number of per day expense. Subscription is too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of transactions that can be added in a day has truly ruined this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to split the expenses. Making the calculations more convenient and job easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using several years, now I'm uninstalling it because of the new policies."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really annoyed with the 3 transaction per day limit!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is good. But it recently keeps showing ad for each expense entry. Also, I only can add 4 expenses per day 🤦🏻‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free anymore, ask money at each and every step. Have been using for years, and now i can only add 3 transactions per day which is not helpful when you add all expenses quarterly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great vision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent push for paid version had just made this app pushing to lose their loyal user. Good luck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this and recommend it to everyone but they've ruined the experience with an aggressively limited free version. I switched to Splid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add multiple experiences in a single day as before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very sad that this was the way the app decided to go. I've probably been using it for 4-5 years and now it's limiting me to up to 3 entries a day. Absolute horrible experience at the end of a trip when we started calculating. Wish I had stronger words to describe how vehemently I hate this cash grab of yours."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst app I've ever seen. First they took out something that they gave for free. Then they aren't able to properly integrate pro features with your email id. It doesn't let even a pro user to add more than 3 expenses. Absolutely sucks. Never install this. Instead go for other free ones."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With limited expenses its waste app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gre0at way to maintain your expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You forgot what you mean by core function of this app by new update. Time to switch, bye 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full waste & greedy app. Charging money for even basic functions also. Useless, uninstalling & searching for alternate app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with the 4 transactions per day limit and the 10 seconds ad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With latest update, can add only 4 expenses a day. It's frustrating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of 3 is the worst move. There are plenty of alternate apps to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes of limiting and adding a timer to even add an expence is the worst decision this company has made. Had to reduce the rating because of this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable without premium abo anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate that number of expenses feature is now unrealistically limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a very useful one to track expenses, now they have restricted 4 expense per day across groups and friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day limit. No, thank you. Time to switch apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was awesome before. Limit to adding the expenses per day is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible app, don't use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app but now it is not even possible to add more than 3 expenses without premium account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the hell is the pro feature, I have to spend money to keep track of my money, thats stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made the app lot worse suddenly and splitwise pro is simply not worth the money, so essentially they forced us to switch, which we did. Sayonara."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is now ruined with 3 transaction limit per day and and the costly premium structure. Goodbye. I'd rather make my own app or use some other."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great until they started with limiting the expense entry. This should be a basic feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Moved basic features to premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Silly update to compel us to buy the pro version. Definitely moving to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great before.. Horrible app now.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wait and transaction limit is deal Breaker... And pro version is not adding good value to it...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"new monetization efforts are obscure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Gutted the free service in December 2023 making the app effectively useless unless subscribed to premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app works fine. But recently they started pushing the pro subscription too much, to the point where you can only add 4 expenses per day for free. That's a huge no-go for me. I'm uninstalling and never using this app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use Kittysplit instead of Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't believe the developers became greedy n moved basic functions to Pro 😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three expenses a day is ridiculous. It makes the app unusable. I might as well go back to excel and split them myself. Stay away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No one going to use it with this pro restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You all are on the track of spotify. You'll soon be out of market. The recent decision regarding per day no. Of expense limit makes it useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of 3 transactions a day make this app completely unusable. I will be happy to pay a one time fee for the pro version but subscription model made me reevaluate if I really needed it. It's not the only app that exist to split bills. Had a great time with it but time to move on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a great app but now it's totally unusable. also, the decision to charge on a subscription basis at exorbitant prices rather than a one time off fee is ridiculous. this is plain money grabbing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only pro has features. Not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise since 7-8 years. I used it to track all my expenses but the recent feature to not allow adding new expenses after certain limit is terrible. I understand the developers need to generate revenue but this is not the way. the subscription amount is too high for my basic purpose, you can always keep high end features for those who are interested."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Settle up is far superior"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do you limit the base functionality of the app?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Runied the app with constant pop ups and transaction limit. Gonna use something else. farewell"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As others mentioned this app is ruined now. They will realize it with a downfall and reviews they are getting now. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What should have been free (basic feature to add expenses) is now behind pay wall. Sad to see demise of such great app. You will be always remembered #RIP SplitWise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great, but with the recent updates, it is frustrating to use! with the adds and limited number of expenses you can add per day, unless you pay a silly amount extra per month, it's pretty rubbish. I will be finding another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always great service, sad that they got greedy and force people to buy premium since recent. I'm thinking for a change as I can't afford it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless without pro. Good job, money greedy company. I hope your company goes to hell and you never get a dime!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They shouldn't have set the per day limit of adding expenses. Also, the Pro subscription should be cheaper, then we can think of subscribing to it, currently it's very expensive for an app like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app has been very useful for a long time. Unfortunately, I discovered today that they make you wait 10 seconds to add any expense and have set an expense limit, unless you upgrade to Pro. This makes it so frustrating that it is unusable for me at this point."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst ever decision to limit the transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is unusable as a free user due to ads and 3 expense per day limit. I switched to a self-hosted solution (nextcloud cospend)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day, and that too after a decade of using it!! Feels like cheating. Plus it's not really doing anything an excel file can't. So yeah, go make your money and lose customer base. Could've done advertising instead. Wouldn't mind that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without payment now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have my own way to keep transactions. Good bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst update ever good bye forever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"How many expenses can be added in a day? This is not fair... The pro is very expensive The core function of this app is not allowed. What's the point? Take money for extra features. Paying just to add transaction so much is not justifiable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor experience after the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall for this. Very sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"terrible experience only allowing to add 3 expenses per day. premium is too expensive. need to look for alternates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty useless without pro. So pretty useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing but now there is a limit of 3 expenses which is useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"i wont pay money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Essentially useless app at this point. Uninstalling it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app started glitching after subscription was introduced, also I don't get the point of subscription for such an app. I would've preferred a one time payment instead. Edit- 25-12-2023 Why does this app even need a subscription model? And now even the MOST basic feature of adding an expense is capped to 3 to 4 expenses per day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful app, pathetic experience, i will not recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible decision to add restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled, now it sucks. Splitkro is now a good option as it able to import data from splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with the new update. Ain't paying such high charges to just add expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires a premium subscription to add many transactions in the same day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to use. A really good app ruined by paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thing is, if your pricing was reasonable I would've paid for the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was an amazing app. Then they updated it, they force us to wait to add and expense AND there is a maximum of amount of expenses you can put a day, unless you pay. This is ridiculous, I will find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yep, it WAS perfect. Now it's useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is becoming useless after they start forcing us to buy pro plans by limiting to add daily expenses to 3. This app is very useful to calculate expenses but not worthy to pay 149rs per month. Time to find alternative application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app anymore for splitting expenses - it's a full paywall to use even the basic functions... they limit the amount of expenses you can enter to 3..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really aggressive paywall. Free version is really bad and limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes managing trips with friends easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Other restrictions are fine but ruined the app completely by adding 3 transaction limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app for finance management. But they screwed it up by making even the basic features available for only Pro members. A non pro member cannot even add more than 3-4 expenses per day. Disappointing. I will be advising everyone to rate this app 1 star and drop it's overall rating on Google Play. Unless ofcourse Splitwise makes some changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally unusable in cureent state, also lack of communication from developers regarding changes to free app is abysmal"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charges now and puts a cap on daily expenses. Used this for years but had to delete."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously? Limiting the expenses to 3 a day? Just show me ads dude - I'll watch a minute of advertising after every 5-10 expenses rather than the current bullsh*t. Good job destroying one of the good apps on here"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you put a hard limit of 3 on Android???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great before but now every feature is locked behind a pay wall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit defeats the purpose of this app. Don't be too greedy or you will lose your customer base, starting with myself. Jumping over to Splid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Frozen since last update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be super useful, however, since the daily transaction limit goading you to buy the pro version, this app has become useless. Horrible mov and I'm sure Splitwise is going to use a lot of customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now everything is paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit on adding expenses for free users is worst decision. It's a deal breaker, moving away from splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was great, but limiting expenses to 3 per day is obscene, at least put a limit that is not achieved by literally leaving the house"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Forcing users to the full version by limiting the number of entries a day. Used for many years but no longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate nag screens. Uninstall, I would have gladly paid for a pro version but the features were not worth the price but I won't tolerate nag screens. Esp since you just forced me to update and then introduced the nag screen. Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they are charging for adding expenses. Splitser is best alternative. Go for it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So far, I never check for other apps because Splitwise serves my purpose for that I can give 5 stars, but with a recent limited 4 number of expenses entry per day and forcing for subscription made me think of other options. Split Wise team, increase the number of entries for free version and decrease the subscription price. Thank you for helping to record my expenses so far."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In agreement with the rest of the reviews...... Way too overpriced for what used to be free features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've limited the number of expenses you can add per day, making the app effectively useless. Use an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro restricted even adding expenses!! Earlier used to love the app. Sad to see this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Essential App for expenses tracking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Cannot add new entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The subscription plan is very expensive. I use splitwise, but not that often. There should be price plan for less use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really? Paywalling basic Graph algorithm? Lol, time to move to other expense tracker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Watching a premium ad every single time you want to add an expense is fun"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice innovation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great until they forced users to purchase the Pro version. This should not be a subscription, include an option for one reasonable payment but until they do this I'll be using a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless limited entries in non pro version . Makes no sense this app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was perfect but since they put limit I am going for other app. Thanks for ruining this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is so annoying now. And the pro upgrade just isn't worth it for casual users. I would even consider upgrading to a cheaper mid tier version. The current pro version costs as much as OTTs do 💀."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't allow you to record more than 4 transactions in a day for the unpaid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing more than 3 expenses in a day blocks the core functionality of the app. I usually add expenses once in a week not on the daily basis. This basically makes the app paid for all cases. Time to move to other app after 10 years of usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be useful, now it's ad infested garbage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We can only add two expense per day which is of no use. Will move on to another split app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced subscription. Free tier has a tiny daily limit now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would not recommend. 3 expense per day limit is really annoying. Whoever decided this move should bear the brunt of lost users for this app. Frankly if I have to pay for just adding expenses I would rather use an excel sheet. Moving to another app now. Thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sudden unexpected high limits to functionality making the app almost unusuable. Might as well make it paid only instead of advertising it as free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day? really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app....has imposed limit on daily transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Taking Spotify route is not going to help. Uninstalling right away, switching to other similar apps. Lost an user from 2017"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"just works! great for sharing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After taking pro I'm still not able to convert inr to any other currency"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful and simple interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great, simple, easy to use app to split household expenses. Super easy and transparent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Won't let you enter more than a certain number of expenses a day without paying for the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense add limit is so bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was an amazing app. It was. Now it's worthless if you don't pay Pro subscription. Uninstalling and looking for other similar."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years, and previously would have given are good rating - but like half the reviewers here...the most recent changes to the free version version are just a bit mad. At this point you can barely do anything (you're now limited to a max of 3 expenses per day?) - everything else is hidden behind a rather high paywall. Just a huge shame, and unfortunately means I'll likely be switching to something new. Would not recommend in it's current form."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor practice to charge money by restricting number of expenses addition per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am never going to buy splitwise pro.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a long time user of this app and it pains me to say this app has become terrible. Just terrible. Waiting 10 seconds and limiting the amount of expenses that can be added are the worst things about it. I'd rather you guys show ad in it than limit the number of expenses that could be added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm fine with looking at ads but limiting to 4 expenses per day? What next, Are you gonna limit the number of times I can open the app? Time to uninstall the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing paid version too hard, not worth $5/mo for basic expense tracking."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free version is basically useless now after the limit on number of expenses per day was set. I wouldn't have minded to pay a one time fee for the app, but a monthly subscription is too much for such a basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic practice of only being able to add 3 expenses in one go. It makes the app practically useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started introducing artificial wait timed before entering data of 10 seconds to move you towards a subscription. Will switch do a different app. I would have been ok with an ad somewhere but forced waiting is a no-go with an app that I use on the go for 5 seconds per interaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"(One and only one) Most of the worst application in my mobile."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app before but now it's useless being able to only enter 3-4 expenses a day with the last few needing to watch an add or wait for a timer to pass. Very disappointing. It's way to much to pay for a monthly or yearly subscription. I would be willing to pay a one time fee of a nominal amount for their premium product but not a reoccurring subscription for something they offered for free for years and other apps will do for free. I will be dropping this app for an alternative one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy peeps. May be add an option to watch ad to add expense?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really good, useful app. Now they've introduced too many steps to try and get you to pay for premium, such as a daily limit on what you can add and a countdown timer before each expense. Would no longer recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The application has basically become trash with their enforcement of Pro version. The free version is of no use now. Different app fir managing expenses is recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once it's was a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limit is now 3 entries per day. I don't add often, usually when bills come due at the end of the month. There are times when I get 0 entries per day which is frustrating. I think pricing should be around $15-19 p/year or add tier level pricing, otherwise this app is going to lose a lot of longtime users really fast."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a good application but right now it has limit 3 bills/day/person and forced us to pay for a splitwise pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I previously gave a 5 stars review. Update Dec 23, 2023: It's a real shame what they've done with such a great app. There's now a limit on daily expenses you can add, which is like two ore three expenses PER DAY. Plus every time you add an expense there's a 10sec waiting time. It used to be a very useful tool to keep track of shared expenses, especially when travelling. So disappointing, I will certainly look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"why make it a paid app?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is now almost lock behind a paywall. I was using this app for a very long time. Probably around 10 years with no issue. Only thing is they now limit the number of transactions per day and you get a timer between each transaction you add."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Idiots getting pro version What is the purpose of this app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have ruined a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app has lost their basic use as pro functionally came. I am switching to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit of 3 expenses per day makes this border line unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice example of becoming a tool to trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would be easily replaced by some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced premium =/"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, especially when traveling with a lot of people! easy to use and free. love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful app to track the group expenses. Probable would require an enhancement to send reminders on fixed time intervals."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As many described, after limiting the number of expenses one can add per day, the app lost it's purpose. They should find better and smarter way to monetize it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adds is okay but limiting the transaction is worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Transactions are limited, premium is being forced. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have ruined this app with trying to force you to buy premium. An advert plays when trying to ad an every expense. I put in 3 expenses and now that's my limit for the day??? Time to get a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't even add expense now Garbarge app as of now, will be looking for other options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limitations on entry of number of daily expenses negates the sole reason why we have the app in the first place. There are alternatives in the market. Splitwise had been a lot of users first choice, I hope the update is corrected before people jump ship."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using for years, the new 3 expense limit makes it unusable for non pro users, look for another app if you're not planning to pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses per day allowed now. This app now become useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No more useful as free user options no more exists 🙏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 Ausgaben max. pro Tag, wenn man nicht zahlen will. Die Preise sind jedoch viel zu hoch! Ich wechsle zu einer anderen App jetzt"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the best app to manage and split expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"helpful app, thankyou"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 tx per month lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started pushing subscription by not allowing users to use the basic features. This is not acceptable, I need to go through their 10 second ad just to add another expense. I am uninstalling this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now this app became paid only. Don't use it. Go to settle up app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You know what I'm talking about. Restricting the users to enter only 2 expenses per day is insanely bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A classic example of ""How to kill a successful product 101"" - A case study in all B schools - What's this everyday limit 🤦‍♂️ - Just 3 transaction per day - how come did you come to this figure? We Indians don't even pay that huge for daily use OTT platforms - please do some research - Im shifting to other platforms - thankyou for your servives & Bye bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they are digging their own grave with this new transaction limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit and timer for every expense add is irritating. Used to be a great app but not now. Uninstalled it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting tactics used to make money. They have now limited new expense entry behind a paywall. You can add just 2 expenses and need to upgrade or wait a whole day to reset that. Filthy disgusting tactics used to make money. No wonder they have got such low ratings now. And the price for Pro upgrade is ridiculously high. Shame on the developers for being such greedy money grabbing cheapskates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but they've limited the amount of expenses you can add to 3. If they wanted to monetize they could have added ads. This has forced me to write this review and I will be moving on to other apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit they've put is pretty damning. Not contwnt with ad wall, they need to put a limit!!! Trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using SW for years, to log small expanses between friends. Now they blocked all free options and limited everything, 3 expenses per day? really? They think we are large business who can afford this huge costly upgrade? who does your marketing? they just killed a good app. I decided to move me and my friends to a much more reasonable option. Goodbye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful and useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"all paid services"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not worth 3 euro per month. Gonna be not of anymore use unfortunately... Lots of other alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've happily used this app for years to track expenses with friends and family, until today. The developers could have literally done anything else - maybe even ads - to keep their platform free. I will be promptly uninstalling. Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become the worst app after introducing the daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, but they just ruined it by being greedy and basically forcing us to get a premium subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What wrong with your business model, why restrict users for adding up only two expenses per day, its a pathetic move . I can understand making money is more important but cutting out the basic functionality of this app . Now who gonna use this app ? Worst experience!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You now with the new update have to wait 10 s every time you want to add a new expense getting advertised to get premium. I'll be looking for a new app soon. Bye bye Splitwise, it was great to free-meet you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"By making pro mandatory and not letting you add expenses for the day if it is more than 3 is really bad. Splitwise is not letting its users use its core functionality. Splitwise now sucks. DONT USE IT"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since last update with a 3 input a day, it's become painful to use. Of course they should monetize the app, the the way they are doing is not ok. Goodbye Spliwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great and my husband and I have used it for years. Now that they want to charge or limit your transactions, we'll be finding something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limits? Get the hell out of here with that rubbish"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great before you guys set a limit to the amount of entries i can put."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good app earlier. Now keeps on nagging to buy pro and doesn't work after specific number of expenses. Will have to search for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful, practical!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The core and very simple feature of the app has been made paid. Shooting on your own foot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app with their horrible decision of implementing a 3 transaction per day limit with an annoying 10 second wait between each. I'm hoping I can find an alternative to what used to be a perfect app. I'm not against paying for it, but making the free tier useless and also having an expensive subscription model instead of a one time payment is a surefire way of shooting yourself in the foot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhai dost zabardasti ke fruits ke paise daal deta tha. Flat chod ke bhaagna pada. Rahul tu dekhra h to main teri hi baat karra hun."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Number of entries is limited to 3 per day. So it became useless for group trips. Also currencies cannot be converted to each other automatically; each has to be balanced individually. Orherwise, synchronisation with friends works well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another great app ruined by aggressive monetization ambitions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this for years and now they're forcing you to get the pro version to add expenses. Will gladly support it if it's a 1 time payment but monthly subscriptions are a huge no no."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Better free app available"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pay for more than 3 entries is insane. Especially if you're in a group with multiple people and multiple spendings have to be tracked, this pretty much has to be done over multiple days. This has been free for YEARS now with pro having more specialized features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"splitwise is easily one of my favorite apps. I used it with roommates for bills and rent, trips with friends, and even now with my husband for bills and big expenses/house projects. so much can be done even with the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Witnessed the downfall of a great app due to sheer greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love it, but with limit of transaction you can add everyday with the free option, wont be using again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have used this app for years and have recommended it to people but the recent update to limit your expenses unless you pay for a subscription is super disappointing and I'll likely look for a similar app to switch to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst.. old days are gone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable without buying the pro option. Will be looking for alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the 3 add expense limit. Not a pleasant experience anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now daily limits (3 expenses per day) and poor communication of policy changes make it utterly useless. I'll be switching to an alternative rather than the monetization bait and switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable. 3 transactions per day?? I do my balancing once a week or on a quiet day on a trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE! Added a 3 transactions per day limit with no advance warning or communication. A completely greedy decision, has bait and switch written all over it. Lure people in with a free service then once they're firmly locked force them to pay. Don't reward this company with your money for this behaviour"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"With no warning, splitwise has decided you have to pay if you want to put in more than one expense a day. It's now utterly useless as a free app. So it is now a pay only app. And if you share it with a partner, they also have to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paisa mangta rhta hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pretty useless right now, find a new way to be profitable like with some ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, they have lost two longtime users with their recent paywall. Our household used this. Subscriptions for the household would amount to $80 a year, which is not worth it. I could care less about the pro version bells and whistles..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Handy tool with friends!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loyal customer for years, the new daily limits make this app unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily limits the number of expenses you can add. We just need the app for expense sharing and nothing else. Very annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I will be switching to an alternative due to disruptive free account policy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to manage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"with the latest subscription model, they only allow to add 3 expenses per day. This app is now completely useless for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years. From vacations to daily budgeting at home with roommates. Deleting now after their shameless press for ""Splitwise Pro"". They only allow 3 transactions a day before hitting a pay wall and push ""Pro"" constantly. It is not at all worth the harassment. There are other options out there for the same functions. I hate to go after all these years but I can't put up with these changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Many options to increase revenue, but you choose to limit the core functionality of adding expenses. Now app is useless, uninstalled now. Use other apps or my own Excel."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For non-paid users, you can't add more than 3 expenses per day which is useless when you're on a trip 🤷"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"EXCELLENT"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only can add more than 3 expenses a day if you're a paid user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"app is not good 1. need to log in 2. cannot attached picture android 3. dupplicate record while add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic & confusing app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bring back the old functionality, definitely not going to pay to use this app. Switching to different app until then."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With new update. Really unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for many years. Was a great app. Now they put daily limits on the number of expenses you can add in an effort to force you to upgrade to pro. This app only serves a purpose when splitting expenses as a group. But try convincing your mates to pay for this. 😂 It's not worth the convenience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Splitwise, you've just lost two customers. I'm not willing to wait 10 seconds every time I put in a cost, nor do I approve of the limit of 4 inputs per day. Looking through your comments as of late, you're pretty much done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden I'm limited to three transactions a day unless I upgrade."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise, the app we once loved for effortless expense sharing, has thrown us a curveball with its recent updates. While some adjustments seem reasonable, others feel like restrictions that hamper the app's original charm. Team should look into it and do the needful ASAP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they started limiting the number of balances to 4 per day without informing and splitwise pro is $40 per year per person which is absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really unhappy about the recent paywall limiting the amount of daily expenses for the free version. Horrible customer experience for an app that I used to use daily and I got so many other people using!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhaiya udharri se nahi nikal pa rha iske karan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes have make it worthless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was an okay app – good even. But now it's useless due to limits and stinks terribly when I see all of those business practices. Just terrible experience and a lesson ""how to kill a good product""."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the new update that limits the number of expenses added per day and ads per expense, no longer a simple and inexpensive method of expense management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using it occasionally for years. Now with 3 transactions per day.... it cannot be used. I will be uninstalling it. thanks for the good years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit reached and I need to purchase pro plan? For an app that don't even support payments. I've been using this app for years but they decided to take a turn for the worse. I'm switching to tricount for my expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new 3 entries limit per day s**ks. The money they are charging for subscription is way too much for just an expense app. I believe most of the people just want to add their expenses without the need for those Pro features. That was a greedy move to hide basic feature behind pay wall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise for years but they ruined it with their new freemium model. Will stop using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why was the limit added on daily expenses. When there are a lot more things you could give in pro. Worst decision. Others who are reading, you can download splid no need to create an account or anything on it. There aren't much features but the basics one which are in Splitwise non pro are there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay $$$ to use the features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously, a pro version??!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 per day is a very small limit. I added expenses yesterday and exhausted the daily limit. Today I tried adding my remaining transactions but was not able to, because of the limit. Don't know when it resets, playing the guessing game."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a long-time fan, but it's become non practical due to the restricted transactions—limited to just four per day for non-premium users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removing features and only allowing 3 expenses per day is awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's absolutely awesome. Update: This constant reminder that I need pro if I want to add more than 1 expense is absolutely ridiculous. Give ads! 🤷"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be the perfect app for managing group finances. They recently updated it to limit the number of transactions you can post per day with no warning. There are many alternative platforms you can find that don't require money for basic use. I would highly suggest looking into other services such as Splid, Spliit, splitmyexpenses, or even just make a Google sheet yourself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"lot's of thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Functionally useless now that I can't add more than 4 transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Didn't like number of enteries for expenses per day. It sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to pay even for the most basic stuff. Greed took over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't force to buy premium on basic app features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app and then they put in excessive restrictions on expense entries to push users to move to the paid pro version. Incredibly disappointed. I guess I'll be using the Shared Google spreadsheet moving forward."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for bill division especially when spending in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything was fine until they decided to go pro even for updating expense!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A once indispensable travel app, completely ruined by greedy monetization. It's fine to monetize, but do so by adding features, such as the currency converter. Do not set a daily entry limit if you're gonna time gate entries. This app is now impossible to recommend to friends while traveling, which was it's chief vector of advertising, the word of mouth of it's users. I get it, you wanna make money, but the pricing is ridiculous. If it was a one time $10, I'd happily buy it. Not $5/month. Awful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used o be a better I would say best app but now with there new pro policy they ruined everything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of 2 expenses per day makes the app effectively unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They may as well make this the paid app completely. Only 3 free transactions allowed per day is basically useless! What kind of doofus in the team management came up with this idea and how is it possible that they have not considered the many free alternatives that already exist in the marketplace. Way to kill all your hard work people!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Whoever decided this new prem feature, really owed a lot to his friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app got us hooked on and then dropped the bomb of capping the daily expense entries.. Such a bummer way to force users to opt for pro version.. If having us endure ads didn't get them enough revenue I guess.. Too bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for groups that have multiple shared experiences."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, i have been using it since 2016 and have brought so many family members and friends to this platform. But their recent subscription strategy with just limited 3-4 transactions a day, are really making to think of other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst update! Limiting expenses was bad decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New updates charges are very high with very less benefit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They had ruined the app. Kind of activities they had blocked recently on name of pro features is terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What stupid limits.. just show ads and remove limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works well, but they have made it so you can only add 4 expenses a day without going to the ""pro"" product, severely limiting it's usability."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used the app for years, was a great app up until now. It's just money grabbing, especially at 40eur+ per year. Edit - I have now moved to an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They made the main feature a pro feature. You can't add more than 3 expenses per day. Very close to deleting it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"You think you don't need this before you use it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app. But now, sorry, but the app now only allows 3 entries a day and just asks me to upgrade to Pro. This new update makes the app Absolutely useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but I now find the free version unusable being limited to only 3 expenses per day. Very disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding data entry limit is soo absurd. For pro focus on other feature dont make basic feature worse to extort money for worse service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense entry [daily] maximum without subscription..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use and very efficient way of dividing money of outings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for any trips or for flatmates as the calculations made by the app is so helpful. the only thing it requires is an inbuilt payment service directly connected to gpay or paytm. Highly recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app but just like everyone else's recent experience the update renders this app pretty much useless. We use this app in my household to keep tabs on monthly expenditures. I was inputting some expenses from a recent trip and was shocked to see that I couldn't any anymore. I considered purchasing em the pro version, but only one of us would be able to add more than four expenses, so really would cost us $80/year. Not worth it at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This was a great app but now riddled with annoyances and limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app is great, but they've all of a sudden limited the free number of expense additions. It just sucks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Daily expense limit? Lmao no I'm gonna switch app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works flawlessly for splitting costs on a friend group vacation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"When I uses it recently in Dec'2023, i was surprised to know they do not allow entry of more than 4 expenses per day, per person with a free account. They've started to charge for an app which is supposed to make splitting expenses easier.. <15-02-2019> The Final trip per head expense summary is unavailable. this will help to know how much the overall trip costed and help in planning the budget for the nrxt activity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really help on manage expenses within group of friends while travelling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have reached maximum rating stars for today. Unlock more stars by paying 149 per month."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the forceful subscription model, it's turning useless. Looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Caps you at just 3 expenses per day. Worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay wall for basic division functionality. App no longer usable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"terminó siendo inutilizable, una lástima la decisión de colocar la función principal que es dividir los gastos como una función limitada y de paga."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used splitwise for *years* (for trips and household expenses), but they just added a 3 expense per day limit to the free tier, which renders the free product essentially useless for us. Support one of the alternative, almost identical apps with a truly usable free option instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Predatory monetisation model, recommend avoiding and seeking alternative. This is unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to use the free version all the time and we could add photos and I never saw ads. Now there are ads and you can't upload photos. I'm pretty sure they also increased the price of pro. Edit: They've also added a limit to how many expenses you can add per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for over a decade and all of a sudden I need to pay for the same service. Crazy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good algorithm for expenses, overall good UI. The attempts at monetization are annoying sometimes (Splitwise's own payment platform offers, limiting transaction posts without premium membership), but hey these apps gotta make $ somehow."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can barely do anything without subscription now. Congratulations on losing your entire user base rather than adapting your model. I'll be using another app now 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So trash that now u can only upload two expenses, add other features behind a pay wall not the absolute basic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is a joke now, trying to force people to pay. Good luck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible strategy of ruining existing customer's value. We were happy with the ads, but now It's almost like we are forced to pay for the normal use of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app. I even considered purchasing the pro tier since I was using it that much but once I saw it costs 30 EUR per year for a splitting expenses app I just gave up and switched to another app. Corporate moves yet ruining another app 🤷‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice, easy and effective app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until they added limited transactions in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be good until the last demand to pay...I just make a share spreadsheet instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this all for years, now is way too aggressive forcing you to pay for pro. Many free alternatives out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and it was awesome. New changes make it absolute trash. 10 second waiting time to make a new expense? And only THREE EXPENSES PER DAY??? Are you kidding me? No way I'm paying for this. It was free and great for so long. Fix it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update makes the app unusable if not paying for pro by limiting you to 3 expenses a day. Been using the app for years and now I have to find an alternative..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new 3-expense cap per day that you ridiculously claim is to stop bots/scams (and that you hadn't even announced and had the guts to say it was to avoid unnecessary communications) will mean the end of using splitwise for me and likely most users. It's too bad I loved the app but there is no justification to pay >40$ PER PERSON per year for something that's pretty simple to make and has lots of alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Spotify and Splitwise competing on who can become the worst app the fastest"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too greedy, not much utility"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are acceptable, but limiting expenses to 4 per day seriously???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad Restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously rated 5 starts, but from dec 2023, they have added limit for adding daily expenses which kinda makes the app useless, started looking for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst monetization model. I am uninstalling this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful for splitting bills at all gatherings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would gladly pay for it if I could just BUY it. I hate to have to make subscriptions for everything. EDIT: rating lowered after the maximum daily limit. Used to be a good app, now it's useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Must have for students, roommates or during journeys. EDIT: They are quizup-ing a good app, trying to make money off every click the user makes. You can't add more than 3 expenses a day, rendering it useless. Just find one of the many free alternatives lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was our default app but the new app forces pro why not use ads as a model than stop users input expense to opt for pro I use it once in a while for few days during trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new model just destroyed the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many adds, now you can barely use it without paying for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes to the free tier of this app have made it nigh unusable. Previously, this was my go-to recommendation to friends, but it looks like that'll have to change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best app out there now the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app with some most wanted functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"simplify debt is awesome 😎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't bother anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise works well and is great for holidays shared with others"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"These money-hungry people have limited these features for Pro users - 1. Searching for expenses 2. Adding more than 3 expenses per day 3. Every time you add an expense, you have to wait 10 seconds. EVERY TIME. We as users should understand that it is ridiculous for an expense-trakcing app to stop allowing us to add expenses unless we pay them for allowing it. Uninstalling, cause there are loads of better, free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Kai k pase"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced Upgradation to Pro? Very unhappy and researching alternatives. This was a cheap move, Team Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent software. i'm using it to manage my all loans, trips and everything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously an excellent app, but the recent change to have a long wait after each item is added AND a cap of 3 or so a day is insane. Truly an awful decision by the devs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Charge money for splits and added so many ads it's practically not usable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a limit for daily transactions is robbery"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"wonderful app for exp sharing and settlement...the app can link with UPI to make direct payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can't get any better I guess"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now thanks to their greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The force to pay for the pro version makes the app entirely useless. If you cannot add more then 3-4 transactions per day, what is the use of this app? Suggest everyone to avoid apps like these to make them understand how annoying this gets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid model is not good at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unhappy with 3 expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From free to too much expensive app. They haven't even released a heads up that this will be a premium app. Time to switch to a different tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty much useless now, can't add more than 3 expenses. I have been using it for almost 5 years now and wouldn't mind paying, but it's crazy expensive given the functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How can you randomly force me to pay after advertising it as free to add expenses. That's a dark pattern that the govt. of India has clearly banned. You're going to have a lawsuit on your hands soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app to have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great ap in the free tier. Now that it pushes so hard on the subscription model it sucks terribly, the price is absolutely not worth it, better to find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit is the silliest thing I have ever heard of. Please remove it so that we can enjoy this app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the subscription idea of splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There was no other app better than this app for splitting expenses. But the recent changes that they have made on the app makes it unsuable. There is a 9-10 second ad to buy the pro subscription everytime you try to add an expense. Also there is a limit on how many expenses you can add per day. These two changes makes the app unusable. I would buy the pro subscription if it's a one time thing and not the monthly/early subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app use to be great. Now the free version is awful. You are only allowed 3 submissions per day now with a 10 second ad in between. Don't bother with this app, I'm uninstalling. It is a waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a long time, but the recent expenses cap has ruined it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app until they implemented a 10 second wait before adding an expense for free users. Making the app's core feature nearly unusable is a terrible idea, and I will be moving off this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for trips. I also use it a lot with my couple for when we buy stuff"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a good app where you could use to split bills and costs with your friends and I have been using it for years, but with the recent update and 3 expenses per day it's practically useless as a free user and it pushes you to premium paid feature. I my opinion it's a worst choice they could make, I would be ok with some occasional add here and there but making that change will force me to resign from it and move to alternative if this won't change. So it's not worth it after recent change"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are fine but limiting number of expenses one can add? Bad decision. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now everything with money?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage updates have made the app unusable. The inclusion of a daily expenses limit now makes the app pointless and to introduce this along with forced ads is a greedy attempt to tank the free version and force you to pay. Will be using a new app moving forward"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my goto app for budgeting but thanks to their recent forceful push towards an expensive paid subscription for some basic math calculations. No thanks. I will write my own app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit of 4 expenses added makes using the app very very frustrating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente para controlar gastos. Fácil de usar. gracias"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new daily limit on expenses is ridiculous. As if I'm gonna pay a subscription to enter expenses in a group I barely use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once great app, ruined by greed. The free tier was fine for my needs. I didn't need the features in the pro tier. Then suddenly it was changed so the free tier only allows 3 expenses per day, rendering it useless for most people. There are plenty of other bill splitting apps out there that offer the basic things for free so don't waste your time with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 4 expenses per day for free users? I'll be leaving splitwise. There are other decent alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Change free featured"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An app that lived long enough to watch itself become the villain. Instead of logging just 3 transactions daily for this cashgrab, just use alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it says. Love that you can split by shares, etc. not always equally. I have used this app for over a year and it still works great. No need to upgrade to the pro version if you add expenses as you go instead of all at once (which is kind of the point of this app, keeping track of lots of little things over months, not doing it all in one sitting or you could do the math yourself. I use this app so I don't have to keep track of things myself.)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is the point of this app if I can only update limited expenses in a day. How can you stop people from such a basic feature. You expect people to wait 1 day just to update expenses? Greed ruins everything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has really gone sick these past few days.. can't really add any expense without paying up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was useful in previous version, now it is useless as only 3 entries are allowed, Bring back older feature otherwise bye bye. Thank you. Aap ja sakte hai..🙏🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to split the expenditure with friends. I am using last 4 year and I didn't found any issue."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used splitwise for years and it has been great, but after the most recent change of limiting to 3 transactions / day it's totally useless. No objections to paying for software but this isn't worth $40 a year. Have migrated to Splitser (really easy to do) has all the functionality needed for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful at preventing arguments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Your pro game can't help you in growing business. At least basic features should remain free for all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall cripples it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"why have you locked out basic features and just put them in your pro version??? Now only limited to 5 transactions per day when before, there was no such limit??? What kind of budgeting app requires you to break your budget just to use it? Atrocious. Money grubber. This rating will not change until you return the basic features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please give us the higher number of expenses to add for a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My friend showed me this app and it's been wonderful for easy living expense Sharing. In larger groups it's even more useful because of the simplified debt. Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There was no match for Splitwise untill now, since they have rolled out their Pro version. You guys are trying to capitalise on the monopoly just like Spotify. Please remove limitations on basic features like searching an expense and adding expenses, you can play the ""Pro"" game on other features which really are good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like all the other users here, can I express my extreme disappointment at this absurd transition, it was fine to have a pro tier and push customers to move there but this crazy 10 second wait to add a damn expense and limits on how many transactions you can add, what? I urged people all around me to move on to this app but they have ruined it completely for free and occasional users, what this app was built on. Will get rid of this and find something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Silent ""update"" that limits to 3 transactions per day. Instead of making me want to buy the pro subscription, it prompted me to change apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but with the latest update is now basically useless. The new limit on the number of expenses per day (3 max) makes it basically unusable. The pro subscription is a farce at £4 a month!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Reduces effort."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously a five. Now its a one. I used to do all my financial splitting witht this app. They have become very greedy and its basically useless for my needs now. You can only add 3-4 entries per day. Subscription service and its $50 per year. I switched to Tricount which has ads, but that's fine by me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for years, now unusable. Not the way to go about up selling. Won't consider using the app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useful at all.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new splitwise pro functionality sucks. 5 dollars a month for this? Should just make a 20 bucks one time fee if something"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would anyone pay per month for a split app🤣"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Interface is great and makes account settlement very easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really liked using this app for tracking and sharing expenses, but the update that introduced the limited number of expenses for the ""free"" version limited me to TWO receipts before I ran out totally bummed me. Guess I'll be looking for a new way to track and split expenses. It's a shame, I've heard this since ~2016"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Heavily pushing premium subscriptions, app is basically unusable now without paying. Too bad, it was a nice tool while it lasted. Time to find a new one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app with 3 transactions per day. Getting Pro membership for expense tracking is useless. Better to find other app or use excel. Stupidest feature for an app I've seen in years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only 3 transactions allowed per day, forces you to watch ads. it's literally just a basic calculator, there are dozens of apps that do this for free. don't waste your time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Worst technical support"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are ruining the app by pushing the pro verison. It is ridiculous that this simple app is even trying to have a pro verison at all. This app use to be completely free, but now they are just removing pre-existing features and adding them to the pro to make money. Shameless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update ruined the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You've made the free version downright unusable with the transaction limits. Shame. Just make the app paid. Don't offer the free version. I would recommend shifting to Settle Up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit....This will be the downfall of splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling until they return usable free version. Dear splitwise people, I understand the financial decision, but this is not how you introduce the $ model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Saddened by the greed, no need to put limits for number of expenses! This is truly not a pro feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Look up Tricount, Splid, Settleup for free apps. This one now tries to get an annual subscription. Also take a look through the recently dated reviews. All one star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to rock- now it wants me to pay a subscription to add more than 3 expenses/ day. Truth is, my bank offers this service for free and I can just use that. The only reason i was still using it was because it was were my girlfriend and I put our shared expenses. Now that theyve made me look at other options, i realize i can get what this app does elsewhere for free, and with less disruptions. To the dev's, use ads in the app, not subsriptions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New changes make the free tier unusable, may as well be paid only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love and use this app all the time, now with the limit of 3 transactions a day it's completely unusable. I like to go through many receipts all at once for household expenses and use this on vacation with friends where you're going to definitely do more than 3 expenses a day. It's not worth remembering what I have and haven't put in so I can dutifully add my measly 3 expenses everyday til I get through everything so I switched apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version totally screwed up with ads, forcing the user to purchase the Pro version. I've decided to move my expense tracking elsewhere. Dear Splitwise team, enjoy charging other users for such a basic function like expense tracking, it was a pleasure to use your app over the past 8y, but enough is enough!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was initially good, but too many features paywalled now e.g. maximum number of expenses in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After one horrible update it made me quit this app. 3 transactions per day was a horrible decision by splitwise tea.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited 3 per day . Hate this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"what a great, simple and effective money tool for groups .. thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic app to keep track of expenses and split them with your mates and family but with the latest update they only allow 3 expenses to be added daily. The app is now a dumpster fire just trying to promote the paid pro version. Will settle my balances and uninstall!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was easily a 5* free version app until they hit us with the limit. I wont pay for this, and neither will the majority of their massive user base. Sorry to see it go, but its nothing unique, just some basic bill splitting...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Whoever's in charge of monetising this app needs to find a new job. £40 per year for this is absolutely ridiculous! It's an expense tracking app that gets used every now and then, not a critical, ultra-feature-packed app. I bought a permanent Windows 11 license for less! I'd maybe consider paying £6 per year for the pro version of this. Anything more is not worth it. £40 would only make sense for permanent lifetime pro. The moment the 3 expenses limit hits me, this is getting uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now everything has to pay. Can just put 2-3 expenses per day. It was better before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As others have previously stated, long term user and now limited to three transactions per day is brutal. Will move on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since last 7-8 years. It was a good experience. Just the basic functionality. But seems loyalty doesn't matters these days. Goodluck with the new premium members."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The calculations are off, the costs are not properly assigned. First and last time ever using this app. It caused far too many issues communicating with the friends I teaveled with. Try QA and fix your bugs!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star because of destroying the app by making it impossible to add more than 3 expenses in a day. Nokia also died one day and other companies like samsung saw the opportunity. This app will go the same way as people will move to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great, until they introduced the 3 expenses daily limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They changed the number of expenses per day to only 3, which sometimes includes a 10 second timer. I understand that servers aren't free, but you shouldn't tread on free user features to try to get them to pay more, especially if that feature is pretty core to the application..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great app unless they add daily limit for just 3 transactions. Where you guys came up with this number ? I can understand due to business needs you have to take some steps. But again just 3 entries ? It would have been better if limit was between 5-10. Pretty disappointed with update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is unusable after they introduced unskipable ads and limit on how many expenses you can add per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ads and restrictions. I am switching to Settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Instead of adding compelling features on a reasonnably priced PRO tier, Splitwire decided to completely kneecap the free tier with 3 expenses a day, or pay 5,5€/month - 45€/year. This is already disproportionate, but no group pricing is RIDICULOUS: I don't want to pay that much money and become the group's accountant at the end of the day because I'm the only PRO tier. I paid for a month (and immediately cancelled) to settle up an existing group. This month is my farewell present to Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It should rather not be free but should charge money to download, so that no one downloads it at all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useful anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to be able to log unlimited entries. It was really uncool of splitwise to limit it to 3 a day. It's okay to do it from the get go, but when users have been using your platform and then you limit the number of posts and ask them to subscribe to post more, it's not fair at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise you need to revise your business model. This freemium version is not going to work. Hire a better PM for your product or if you are not getting any I can help."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is killing itself with the new update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of the number of expenses per day is ridiculous as who would just do 3 transactions per day?! We rely on the app for the splitting of bills to ease our daily lives especially when you're travelling with friends, but this is not helpful at all. Not even one day of usage and I'm gonna uninstall it now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Newer version has ruined the app, limiting the basic features was infact a wrong move Will be moving to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a paywall and expense limit. Makes it now unusable. There's other free alternatives so time to switch"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 second paywall wait time on all actions for free users is ludicrous. Looking forwards to finding an open source alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Many many thanks to Splitwise team. It's time to say goodbye. Now I'm using PhonePe to split the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switched to Splitwise because the UI/UX felt better than other apps on the market. But with the new limit of 3 transactions per day for the free version, it does no make much sense to use this app anymore. Such a shame, it was a great app, I would paid to use it, but the monthly cost is way overpriced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How can you limit the number of times a user can update the expense!! Went downhill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pre-update : 5* app Post-update : 1*"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was great now the free version is to intrusive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update makes the app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Zero stars for forcing to use the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's practically useless now without paying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am paid subscriber but I feel the money charged is definitely very high. Plus, if you are charging that kind of money, allow atleast family to be included in same plan. If a group of friends or family has to use this, expecting everyone to subscribe is just outrageous. Plus from app POV also it's not like some extraordinary features are available to paid subscribers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"War mal gut, seit kurzem kann man nur noch wenige Transaktionen einstellen. So quasi unbrauchbar."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"999/yr for pro subscription is an absurdly high price point, considering apps like amazon prime and hotstar annual subscription is kept almost at the same price with 100x more utilities and services. Uninstalling splitwise as there are multiple other free apps giving the same feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was really good until they decided to limit expenses and introduced delays unless you subscribe for Pro version. All for developers to make money but there must be a better way than this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye bye splitwise. Your convenience over a Google sheet does not justify the paid cost. Not usable without paying due to restrictions to transactions per day. Oh yeah, they charge even though they collect and share your personal info. Figure out how to be profitable through data like social media, charge but respect privacy, or do what I anticipate and go under/be acquired."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great app that could be used for free. Now in free version you can make only 3 or 4 entries a day and even for those you have to wait few second and watch ad of premium version of the app. I don't recommend it. So long you greedy..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do one of these. Bring back Old Free Model . Or Reduce the Annual Pricing to ₹99 / year Or Allow Unlimited Add Expense with watching ad or something. But Make us do the basic thing of this app. Otherwise. I have to go back to old Excel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now only let's us add 3 expenses per day unless we pay for the premium plan. Will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly forcing a paywall to access basic features is really unethical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The worst introduction for premium in the history of apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such an easy way to keep tabs on who paid what and when, and who owes who. Takes the stress out of family finances !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app uswd to work perfectly. Now there is a pay-wall for adding multiple.expenses per day. Also the list of all the expenses is gone. It was fun while it lasted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You got to be joking. I'd rather use excel again than pay 5.5eur per month for this app. It's a great app, but your new payment model is a total ripoff. I am switcing to different app asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update that forces one to buy their PRO subscription to add unlimited expenses is the biggest downgrade. It was once our go-to app for expense management. Such a shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing the premium option, while actively blocking features on the free version has to be one of the most infuriating things an app can do. Do the devs honestly think splitwise is a product that cannot be replaced?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. I'll be finding another app now that the free version is basically useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"2023 Edit: believe this round of bad reviews. App sucks now. 2019: Dont believe any bad reviews. This app does what everything it promises. A feature request that's in the pro version or not actually knowing what the app does doesnt warrant a negative review."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes sharing of travel costs so easy. Thank you Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fed up with latest update. Need pro for adding more than 4 expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How to kill an app 101"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such a pathetic app. Now it is asking for money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app, easy to use with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Handicapping of once useful app and alienating the use base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A really handy app for keeping track of who owes what, once you get the hang of it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Surprising they think everyone in a friend / family group would all get a pro version of an app to do something they can do in excel. I've used this for years but won't be able to convince anyone I know to keep or use it. Time for something new. I might have paid $5 but ads would have been the way to go for an app that gets better from economies of scale."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"dumb thing now wants me to pay for ""pro"" every time I enter a transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now there are full-screen slowdown ads and a 3-items-per-day limitation which try to get you to pay for Pro. Moved to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a good app before. The new update deserves a negative rating. Constant ads and limits to 3 expenses per day. Very ridiculous prices for the subscription too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads per trasaction (after the limit is reached) is too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new pricing the app has become useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app and came here to see if there was an alternative to the paid version. Like everyone else it doesn't seem fair to force people to pay for pro version and adding a 10 second wait to add expense. Might as well move to another alternative or just use excel. Huh what a waste. Atleast if it was a reasonable price one could have reconsidered but don't think I will now. BYE BYE SPLITWISE. You lost your charm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Useful until they started rate limiting daily expenses for the free tier :/"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing my review from 5 to 1 star. Used this for quite a while and loved it...until they removed the unlimited expenses. Now I am forced to upgrade and the upgrade does NOT add more needed features. Will be closing my account and moving out another app. Splitwise Pro must work on adding features for this version worth the cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Era muy buena pero se puso muy onerosa con los planes pagos..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow, 3 expenses per day now unless you want to move to PRO. Disgusting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit on daily transactions has me leaving for another app after six years. Would have been happy to donate or pay a one time fee for full version, but the subscription costs are too high for what this is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would have given 5 stars if they actually kept it free. I can't believe I can only add 3 things on a list for it to tell me I have to pay $5 a month so that I can add unlimited in one day.... what a joke. I am trying to be able to get the expenses for a trip written down and now I have to write them 3 / day ??? What a scam to inconvenience people into paying for the app. What a terrible business model because who would pay that??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, the latest updates are trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my choice of app. Moved all my expenses to tricount now it's limited to 3 expenses a day. Basically useless for my needs now. Will delete"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit suck"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new approach of trying to force long-term users to pay for the pro version is not okay)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became paid after 3 expenses. Not a free app anymore don't see the value for this price sad they chose to go this way for the economic model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great until the latest update. Now after entering 3 expenses now it forces me to enter the other expenses next day. The core usage of the app is restricted. Also the pro subscription is lot depending on the feature which will be used. Could have included a one-time subscription option. Very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To much money now, pulled us in, now have to change. Make it a small one off payment. (£3)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly requesting £40 a year for its use and unpaid version has such limited functionality it is now unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable after update with transaction limit and waiting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fabulously wonderful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't know what is the purpose of app now, If they allow only three entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and it's been great BUT now they have limited us to 3 expense entries per day (which is basically useless) otherwise you have to switch to the paid subscription model. I obviously will be moving on because it's ridiculous to expect people to pay for this when there are plenty of free options available. Try Fairshare instead. Goodbye Splitwise, got greedy and now you're losing customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app now allows only 3 expenses to be recorded per day per user in its free version. And that's the core feature of the app. Introducing a subscription based plan to allow more than 3 expenses to be recorded is totally dumb idea. Majority of other features that they provide are not even useful to most users. It's definitely time to find alternative options as this app is now useless. Even the subscription charges are too steep for users who use it to record expenses and nothing more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Did exactly what it said it would do and now has a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day is ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app, easy to use, extremelly useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable now with max 3 expenses a day. There's plenty of other options thankfully"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app to use. Very weird to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has become pretty much useless now, It shows ads after every entry which is annoying and to top that they have limited the amount of entries one can enter per day. It's going down Spotify route. Congratulations for ruining your own app Splitwise team"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced a paywall to only allow 3 transactions a day. Surprise change that makes the free app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow, basic functionality under paywall. You can now record only 3 transaction per day. Deleted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and use it a lot but the recent update is terrible and a complete waste of time. Not user friendly at all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have moved all the basic features to pro 🤬🤬🤬"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"(2019) Perfect app for managing balances in a group of friends. . (2023) Four years later, I can no longer recommend this app. Limiting the most basic feature of your app to 3 payments per day disrupts the user experience drastically."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for ages now recent update totally crippled the app and makes you forcefully switch to pro version, I don't mind small ads here and there but now it's out of hand... There are 1000s of apss just liked this app bcz of nostalgia but now Devs are forcing me to quit this app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update with only 3 transactions per day sucks! Will come back to give 5 stars if this demand for premium is taken back"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using split wise apps for the last 8 years and so far everything works perfectly fine. Splitting expenses with friends and family is done seamlessly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you taking the piss? A once decent utility, this has now become entirely useless, requires an entirely unjustified expensive subscription even for basic features, even though it's already infested with ads. Do you really think anyone's going to pay for this 😂 Moving across to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They literally killed it with this 3 expense per day bs... And the reasoning behind it is even more infuriating: ""bots spamming us"" lol just admit you want more money from subscriptions... If this had a lifetime option I would buy it but no way I'm giving monthly money to these people.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing my rating from 5 star to 1 star. Used to love splitwise earlier. Installed again after a year for a trip and its not allowing to add expenses, watching ad to add expense would have been still okay (Would have given you revenue as well), but not allowing to add is not feasible. Will take the group members phone and complete trip expenses and then uninstall it for good. Time to find another app for group splitting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app it doesn't allow to add expense until you buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update: I'm dropping this app, since they (suddenly, without warning) got really pushy about the Pro version they made the free version useless. And the value proposition isn't there for the Pro option. €30 a year is way too much for such a minor and specific use case. --- Old review: Great app, really useful and simple to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are now limited to 3 expenses a day and have to watch an add after each addition. It is insane how hard they are trying to push you to pay. Barely useful anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many adds, not allowing to add more than 3 entries in 1 day. Asks you to pay everytime you add an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been using it for 5 years ..Too costly.. i am leaving the app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be so good! But now with the limited expenses you can input (4 a day I think?) And the ads for premium that sometimes come up after inputting an expense I will find a new app sadly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Full screen adds and waiting time before entering an expense, max 3 expenses per day. Infuriating update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not happy with pro membership"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy premium plan, useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise pro has ruined the app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version has only 3 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used splitwise for years and it has been great, but after the most recent change of limiting to 3 transactions / day it's totally useless. No objections to paying for software but this isn't worth £40 a year. Have migrated to Splitser (really easy to do) has all the functionality needed for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Downfall of a great app. The basic functionality was to be able to add expenses, but the greedy Splitwise management now wants you to pay a monthly subscription. I can understand the subscription for high end features, but just to add more that 3 expenses I gotta buy premium? Duck off. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use it a lot. But not of any use now. Too expensive for just calculating bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Overpriced and limited. There are other apps that do the same unlimitedly and free of charge"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a great app! We used Splitwise for almost every holiday trip and even created a group for our shared groceries at home. It's been years that I used this app and was amazed of the simplicity and great user experience. But now, without any warning, I get stopped after entering 3 expenses every day with a note that I should upgrade to PRO. It justy instantly killed my user experience. After all this time it seems that I have to look for alternatives.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Super at what it does. Great UI."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App fantástica para compartir gastos. 5 estrellas cuándo realicen el widget, lo unico que falta. EDIT: pagaría sin problemas 2,99€ una-tantum para esta aplicación. Ese precio mensual, incluso para funcionalidades básicas, no me merece la pena. Paso a otra aplicación."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must use app.... it's really worth to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like everybody else reviewing this recently, it was a great app and I used it mainly when tracing with my partner and our friends. But the daily limit of only 3 expenses is really unfair to everyone who's been using this over the years. I'm sure we'd all pay a small one off fee to continue using as it was, but the pro version isn't worth the money for the features you get, so I doubt anyone is actually purchasing it. Uninstalling and looking for an alternative. Shame on the developers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to use this app a lot as was very helpful to keep track of who spent what and who owes how much. The new update that limits the amount of expenses (which is 3) per day is a bit ridiculous I don'tind seeing ads but outright limiting the amount of expenses that can be added is a very strange decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent move to limit free users to add expense and a 10s countdown is an absolutely wrong move. Used to like this app for travel expenses but would totally consider other free apps with no limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous, limit of 3 transactions. I would suggest using a different app. A fiver a month is a complete joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable app after recent update because they are practically forcing us to buy pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a very friendly app in the beginning. Now it forces is to buy pro subscription which is too annoying... Can't add more than 2 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit and timer for adding expense. Way too expensive for Pro version. Maybe if there was a cheaper version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise no longer offers even basic functionality like adding more than two expenses unless you pay for pro. I wouldn't recommend the app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, until they made a premium version. Instead of adding a lot of features, they removed features for the basic version. A lot of ads (from splitwise telling you to upgrade) and limited amount of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is going downhill the limit of 3 expenses a day is stupid and makes it impossible to use without pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Killed the app with the 3 expense limit per day. Can't use this anymore just to track purchases with my partner"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for a subscription just to add expenses? Your app is gonna die period."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works fine perfectly at first, but after you integrated it into your daily life they suddenly restrict the number of expenses that you can add per day to a useless minimum. In midst of our holiday we have to go back to making our own lists if we don't want the pay version. I feel like being tricked into a trap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Becouse of the 3 transaction limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Bye bye. The pro version is not worth for me to pay. I don't use it that much. Switched to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great flexible app but it's hardly usable since they introduced the 3 expense limit. Pro version is too expensive to justify infrequently adding expenses. Time to find an alternative I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Max expenses have ruined this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a long time user of this app! I understand why they want to sell their pro versions but to put a hard limit of 3 expenses per day is the deal breaker for me and it seems like many others. I'll slowly be moving away with app altogether!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Too costly subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are pushing pro mode too hard, rendering the app useless for expense sharing (limit of 3 daily) without it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update literally bombed itself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic way of strongarming customers into a paytrap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Leaving the platform due to the rate limiting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable app if you have the free version and need it for daily expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The 3 expenses per day limit is absolutely ridiculous. The app used to be very very good and I really understand that they need to make money, but I think this is too radical. Really hope they can find a better way to make the app profitable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used the app a lot and love it during travels. Now that there is a pro version the free version is totaly trash. You can only add max. 3-4 expenses a day and if you add expenses to fast you have to wait a few second to add another expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now :( You cannot search for expenses anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has been a great app for many years for sharing with housemates/partner, but the new restriction to 3 expenses a day with constant unskippable ads for premium have ruined this app, time to find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses a day? There is virtually no development cost still this much greed? Just sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very dissappointed with recent update. No one is going to pay you with these annoying things you guys added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The newly introduced changes of only 2 splits and very costly pro version is way too much ask.Will try to shift to another free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go-to app for expense tracking and splitting. Now they got greedy with the last update and you can only post 2 expenses a day and watch an ad everytime you want to do so. Not worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This application is very helpful, but having that subscription option is not good for students. You should give at least basic functionality but for enhanced once you can charge."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What. Have you done?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"After update, app start to restrict the expense items"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from a 5-star app to a 1 when they made the free version unusable. 10 second ads and a limit of 3-5 expenses per day - just completely unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have a pro version, which is not a good value for the offered features. Recently, they made the normal version unusable by adding limits to the number of expenses/day + making you wait when adding an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses a day which makes it useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable with the new freemium model. Used to be a great app. Having premium for extra analytics was fantastic, but with the changes it is completely unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now they limit the number of expenses you can add to 3 a day unless you pay for the Pro version. Unbelievable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good free app, now it won't let you add more than 3 expenses in a day without forcing you to get the paid Pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great and used alot for group trips. Now with a limit on adding expenses. It's forced me to leave the app for another option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why ads? Why we can add only 3 entries a day? In this way you will loose your customer base. I'm uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please interegrate ads for free users instaed of forcing them to purchase the subscription. You guys are doing great, but please do not stop your potential users to shift on other products. I hope you can cover the cost by implementing google ads, like banner ad, native ads with or without media, interstitial ads and reward ads etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I don't like the pro ads and waiting for it to go so I can add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic features gone Premium sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really killed a good thing here. #6 grossing app in finance on the play store but that wasnt enough for them so kneecapped the free version of their app. I'd happily pay a one off fee but the convenience of this app isnt worth the price they are trying to charge for admission. Especially when there are so many alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to like this app very much, but now it limits the number of time I can add an expense, which reduces its usability to me. I would have been happy to watch ads to use it's core features for free, but the new subscription plan makes the app totally useless & forces user to buy premium. If it continues, might consider uninstalling the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited basic functions behind a pay wall. It wouldn't have been an issue if the pro version offered new things instead of limiting the most basic aspect of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was goto app for most of us. Now its riddle with ads, limited number of expenses for free users, and pushes you to get pro version but applying a 10s wait-time when trying to add new expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription plan is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best apps for split share but the recent update made it impossible to add more than 2 expenses. It makes no sense to go for pro version when we needed only it's basic function of split sharing. Pro version makes sense when wanting to use charts and additional services but paying for basic functionality is nothing but useless for general users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update adds limit of 5 expenses per day. Then blocks the creation of any more without paying for the subscription. Went from being a useful app to a pay to win scam. Disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was invited by a pro user who pays for the app before a trip. I told them it would be easier to just settle up at the end and they were insistent this was an easier, better, fairer system. I got together all the things I paid for and started adding them and got locked out after 4 entries. A horrible first experience for an app that's a good idea. Everyone has to pay for premium for this to be worthwhile. Not even a trial to see if it works for you, just makes more work for you. Zero Stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 entries are free. Instead of this Many good apps are available for free. I think basic functions of this app must be free but those who want pro must be charged."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"this thing is messed up. only 3 expenses/day, and can't search stuff.. and need to pay for basic features that were free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One of the best apps for a group of bachelors who stay together.... I wish I could give more than 5 stars. [This was my review in 2014] Had been a user for 12 years. Here is my new review. 👎. Please thank the team who came up with the limitations and forcing the user to go pro. Job well done. Now I wish I could give ZERO stars. Will be moving on to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of forcing to pay for pro package"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My partner and I have been using this for a few years now to keep track of spending, great to use when we are travelling with a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app but recent subscription changes made this app useless for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful approach to monetization"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Others explained it well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits to 3 input transactions per day now. Gonna uninstalls and find alternative. What a cocky app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good until they Limited the number of transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise is making their app much worse, with a limit on daily transactions. It's disappointing because the app is only slightly more useful than a shared Google Doc, so paying for it seems ridiculous unless you're a power user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why subscription is mandatory"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now completely useless unless you pay for premium, much better alternative apps for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was awesome until they put a limit of expenses you can register ina day. Now it's horrible. Switching app right away!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used Splitwise for around 5 years to manage various trip and household expenses. It was free so there was no barrier for friends or family to collaborate. The latest update means you can't submit more than 3 expenses per day without paying ~£40/year. The barrier to entry is now so prohibitive that collaboration is no longer possible, defeating the entire point of the app. Make premium cheaper, and allow everyone in a group with a premium user to submit unlimited expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has lost its core if you can not allow 3 exp entries without paying then this is not worth it Also who is using all their fancy features?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible decision to limit expenses per day and lock them behind a paywall. Hopefully they revert this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update broke the core functionality. Limits of a stupid business model and greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"way less intrusive than tricount and easier to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great app! love it. been using for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 2 expenses per day? At least give us 5 ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been my trusty companion for years, quick and simple to add home and travel expenses. I even used for a while in Pro version and switched back since I didn't need extra features at the end. New free version is pretty much unusable with its 3 transactions daily limit, especially for a person like me who adds backdated transactions when I simply recall them. Probably worth paying 1-2 USD a month given its simplicity but definitely not 8 USD. I'm switching to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another great app ruined for a quick dollar, shame on your for exploiting your users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from being free to unusable behind a paywall. Prohibitively expensive if you want to use pro in a household. They're going to slowly go out of business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"New update has killed the app. The simplify debts could be made a pro feature. Not the adding expense ones."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, until today when it wouldn't let me add more expenses. That's the only thing your app is good for, and you blocked it!? Pathetic. Bye Felicia."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removal of functionality from the free version. There's a limit to expenses you can add per day and ads you have to watch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Oh dear! No longer functional because of the restrictions in transactions and crazy price for the Pro. £3.99 per year, maybe, but £39.99 or year, no."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new limit I will be Uninstalling as soon as ee get our bills figured out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Súper útil hasta que han hecho la última actualización en la que solo deja poner 2 gastos al día gratis... monetizacion pura y dura."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entry per day limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome way to split and manage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for years but they've instantly lost me now that they've added an arbitrary 10 second wait for each expense I want to add. A shame because it was good while it lasted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update ruined the whole experience. I understand need to monetize the app. But locking user from using basic functionality is just preposterous. Team should reconsider the pro version push and should come up with alternate strategy. Until then it's time to switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Amaba la aplicacion, la usaba en todos mis viajes. Pero ahora colocaron maximo de 5 gastos por dia si no eres pro. Ya no tiene sentido seguis usandola para los viajes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add expenses, asking to upgrade pro. It's time to move out from splitwise.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is basically useless after the latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app's core feature, adding expenses, should stay free. As a user tracking monthly expenses, the current limitations drive me to consider alternatives due to the three-record update delay. The annual subscription charges appear unjustified considering these constraints. Splitwise should explore a middle ground to retain users and maintain positive ratings while addressing these issues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entry per day, together with 10s ads between each one has render this app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Premium fee force."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too pushy for the paid version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses per day is free... I am using this app for more than 6 years and without any communication, they just forced these restrictions.. not at all professional..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use and reliable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Avid user of splitwise for many years - considering alternatives now that the model has changed to be so restrictive. A monthly fee for premium feels very out of touch and expensive for what is effectively a simple process, done well by the app - a one off fee for premium, with the basic model untouched feels far more appropriate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The makers are just taking undue advantage of their USP. Limiting users to only do 3 entries daily and more than that it asks for pro upgrade. That's not a good sign of UX. Pro & premium services meant to have extra features and not restrict the core basic feature. This is pathetic. It's a sign of downhill."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: down to one star because ads now kick in when you add expenses. I'm sorry but that just kills it for me. Am now switching. Brilliant app with everything you need and works flawless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version for basic functionality should be continued. Disappointed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Premium subscription just to add more than 3 expenses. That's too much greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit for transactions has to GO! This is unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I guess now is the time to make the company profitable and give exit to the VC. Was One of the best apps but now all the push is to make you buy pro. You will get ad after every entry and after 5 entries you will reach the daily limit. It was a good run till it lasted. Time to switch to another app as the subscription price is not worth the functionality it provides and also a lot of other free options available which provide more or less same experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The newly introduced limit of 3 expenses per day for free users is a tough blow to users like me who have been using this app for many years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There was no other app that can be compared with splitwise.. However recent changes made by the splitwise is inaccpetable. Currently it allows only 4 entry of expenses in a day. Giving extra features with extra payment is acceptable but not allowing its core features is inaccpetable. Untill they changed their policy, switching to similar apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update makes it's practically useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use splitwise among my boarding house friends. It is very useful in our day to day life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limit to add expenses and can't upload photos behind a pay wall lol you guys have become a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous to develop a userbase and forcing everyone to Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ad before adding each expense? Crazy! And limit to max no of expenses per day? Crazier!! And the max limit is 3 expenses/day? Craziest!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rate limiting number of expenses per day makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I keep getting expense limit reached just after adding 2 expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid subscription to use basic functionality ... useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great free app before the recent modifications."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are now forcing full screen 10 second ads and you can only add a few expenses a day if you don't pay a subscription. After years of use we are switching to a different app. Disgusting changes!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Estragaram o app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible application, worst thinking and implementation for profits. Started premium to even add a split. Later they gonna ask for membership to even open the application I guess. Poor fellas 😞 . Probably gonna switch to another application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad app because of subscription fees"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Developers have become greedy. They have limited transactions to 3 a day, and are trying to firce you into paying for their pro subscription if you want to add more than 3 a day. They used to be good and have no limits. All of u sidden, they have put in a limit and the app tells you to pay for pro if you want more. Seems like a pointless app now unless you are willing to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"added ads and we can't add more than 3 expenses in a day. trash app. you lost a customer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a shame. A revolutionary app, a symbol of 2020 technological comfort. 6€ monthly? Damn, Netflix is cheaper. I'm deleting the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the app for tracking group expenses. Introducing a ""premium"" subscription to add more than 3 expenses per day has to be one of the worst decisions I've seen. I've only used this app on trips to add many expenses over the course of a few days. No way am I going to pay a monthly subscription. I would give 0 stars if possible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? Really, migrate to new app everyone!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started limited the number of expenses that can be added daily making the app basically useless when compiling things all at once after a trip. Will be moving to a different platform after almost a decade of using this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but the free version is now unusable due to limiting how many transactions you can add per day and making you wait 10 seconds."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its getting worst only 3 transaction are able to add and asking for payment. Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to see and add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version became useless after introducing just a few expenses limitations per day. And 30pln/mo for fancy Google sheets is quite a lot. Many decent substitutes available in Google store."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a regular user for a few years now. So upset by the 2023 update that makes the free version basically useless and super frusterating to use. Without an affordable one-time upgrade to pro version I will be looking for an alternative option. I will not be paying $5 per month to basically do some simple math for my roommate and I. What a shame that this excellent product has been destroyed by greed. Hope the decision is reversed otherwise there will be a mass exidous from their system."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Allowing just 4 expenses a day and pushing to purchase pro isn't a good marketing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetizing the app will be the worst move ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was good till date while now they are charging of services. Only good free app now start taking money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now they have implemented a maximum number of expenses you can define per day, unless you pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"40 USD per year subscription fee is ludicrous, especially after offering years of free service. If you don't move to a free, ad-supported model, you'll lose me and many other users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Really good app, but requires Pro in order to be used"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"stupid restrictions and monetisation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop advertising splitwise pro everytime"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great for years, but adding the daily expense limit (of three!) means I'm going to look for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now they've limited the amount of expenses you can add per day, making the free version useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 daily expenses cap ... sad I liked the app and brought a lot of friends and family over years on it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable for free tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the last update we cant add morethan 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Desde que pusieron solo 3 gastos gratis arruinaron la app. Voy a buscar un reemplazo ya que no sirve más para su propósito."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free app unusable now, guys don't offer a free version that's not practical. I don't need limits on number of expenses.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent upgrade that forces us to pay for Pro version and how can you put a daily limit on adding expenses? You will lose all your users if you continue doing this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate that they're limiting basic functionality to force users to get pro subscriptions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a waste now that you have to PAY to put multiple expenses in. Wish I could track that on my payments, but I reached my limit for the day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking to get the pro version is the killer!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is useless now. Unless you are splitting 1 or 2 expenses, you cannot add more to a group each day. I used to use splitwise after all trips w/ friends to split expenses. Now I have to add things piecemeal over a week because of a 3 expense daily limit?? Thats legitimately crazy. There is NO way around it either. They allow you to watch an ad to be able to add the third expense, and from there you ONLY have the option to pay 5$/month or $40/year. Evil."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the most scammy way to force users to pay. I don't mind these tactics, just forcing it suddenly is the problem. If these were present when I first downloaded the app years ago, I'd have the option to decide if I want to continue using the app or not. I actually don't mind paying a one-time fee. But recurring subscription for an app like this? Really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very Bad, this is not how paid subscription should work. Money should be for premium features and not the very basic, like adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty impressive to see how you can ruin a fully working and amazing app into a terrible experience. It's probably one of the most flagrant examples on how one should not monetize an app. Time to move to another app without any paywalls."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They broke their product by placing arbitrary limits in order to extract as much money as possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app, but now they restrict how many entries you can add per day, and they force an unskippable advert in front of you pushing the premium version. It's not worth the £40 a year they've asking for as I don't use it that often. Looks like I need to go back to using a Spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"this was my favorite app! it now sucks due to their greed this was so unnecessary byeee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"so easy with pro to deal with multiple currencies!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update adds a limit to transactions that can be inserted a day. Shame, look elsewhere for free simple communal expens management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now doesn't let you add expenses after 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day after 10 years. Sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The adds and videos I could say ok.. but the New ""daily expense limmit"" it's just ridiculous, they killed the app.. just uninstall it !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have Limited the number of expenses per day in the recent update, and the pro version is too costly. Was a great app untill the recent update, now it's just useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this for more than 3 years. Now recent update they invented new strategy for buying pro app. Please bring old one. Rating one start because of the new update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be good for free to use until it decided to be a money grabbing machine. uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps i could have hoped for, thanks to the developers for making such an Awesome application with this many features that makes daily life so easy. I use it everyday, with features that simplify all the calculations and learning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shameful update. Constant ads and worst of all, limit of transactions per day added to the app. I will find an alternative asap and uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows users to add only 3 bills on a given day. Not suitable for people like me who add all the bills at the end of the month. I have been using this app since 2013 and have convinced many of my friends and family to download this app since then. Looks like will have to migrate all of them to a new app. Another new change include having to wait 10 seconds before adding new bills. Splitting manually seems faster😂😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the use for free users is a dumb way to make they get the pro version. Show me more you can offer, don't take away what already had to sell me it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Marketing teams should be fired"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Oh dear, they've made a huge mistake. Very low daily caps on expenses, time-out periods, and a recurring monthly subscription rather than one time fee.... no thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great. Was an easy way to divide bills with friends, roommates, etc. So I got to give it to you guys, congratulations on absolutely ruining it. Putting a limit to the amount of expenses and pushing for a ""pro"" version on this is just beyond me. You excelled in making this app useless, I will be looking for a better alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is such a waste app now as its not allowing to add more than 3 expenses a day and its costing more than a Netflix subscription. Ehat are they thinking. Anyway uninstalling it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very useful. Used to love this app a lot. After recent update only 3 expenses can be added, which is highly irritating. Will uninstall soon to break 8 years of relationship."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can add only 3 expenses in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a great app very helpful. Suggestion to add a description box for the items added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Basically useless as a free app since it cuts you off at 3 entries in a day. Charging $40 a year for a fancy spreadsheet that divides by 2 is obscene. Don't bother."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Actually unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a user since 2016, up until now when the free version is rendered essentially useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With new update even for basic functionality it is asking to pay . The app is useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app with a ridiculously low number of entries per day allowed. They also added ads before you can post just like everyone else has mentioned. Stay away from this app, there are many other alternatives out there!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Free account limited to three expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have a lot payment options pending and to add all at oncr but this guys made it compulsory to buy pro to enter more than 5 entries. Could have given the notification atleast about the paid thing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pro subscription existed for sometime and offered many in depth features but the basic functionality of the app remained free. But everything changed when the greedy peeps at Splitwise decided they need a new Lamborghini. Now the app is so annoying that is forces you buy the subscription. Could have made it a one time purchase but nooo! They want your money monthly. Tell you what, not paying subscription, logging my expenses in Excel and updating Splitwise everyday... Downfall of a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined my holiday for not being able to log all expenses between me and my friends at the end of the day. I wish I used Tricount instead which doesn't limit the usage per day. I hate the paywall screen. I'll uninstall as soon as I'm back home. Find another way to monetize your product guys. Your PMs suck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing the ""premium version"" is ridiculous. I can't add my new expenses because I've ""reached my daily maximum of 4 expenses (???!!! )"". It's one thing to offer advantages when using the premium, it's another to force the customer who has been using the app for years, by imposing ridiculous restrictions. There are plenty of other apps that could offer the same service . Forcing us to use premium is the same as making us look for other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I would have given this app 5 stars but after the recent update the application team went greedy and restricted/ limited the entries per day to promote the pro version which is pathetic. Learn from YouTube or Spotify they won't restrict us but use AD in between. Pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on daily additions is ridiculous, the free version is unusable. After being a great tool for so long and even a pro customer at times. Will find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was all good. Now lets you add only 4-5 expenses a day or use pro membership. What business model. Great! Will lose the user base pretty soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier it was free. Then they started taking monthly charge of 49 ₹ which was fine. Now they are asking for 149₹/month which is expensive. I'm uninstalling it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits entry per day to 3. Don't use this, just install other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"12/12/2023 — As many other long time users have stated, the sudden changes are extreme and we received no warning in advance. I loved this app and would've been willing to pay something, but $5/mo or $40/yr is steep. Bitter ending. 07/11/2014 — So easy to use, simple but good looking interface that has all necessary options. Appreciated that it simplifies debts between parties. Also like that it's available on multiple platforms. Really well thought out design, thank you for making Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying pop ups to push pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Perfect for sharing costs with friends and roommates for household or trips! Update: losing a star since they took away photo function, that's now Pro version. Still pretty useful without, but kind of a bummer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously 5 stars. Update: Dec 13th, 2023 They have limited the number of expenses that can be inputted to 3/day. As I budget monthly, it's is very inconvenient when I need to enter over 20 expenses at once. I've been using this service for almost 3 years and was not notified of this change. I will be switching to a different app or making my own spreadsheet. It's upsetting to lose so many years of transaction history so I am leaving a 1 star review."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate that they are pushing people to buy the pro version. Adding the expense limit without giving any warning to the user shows that all they care about is a quick money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app but after subscription thing, am not ginna use it anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but monitized heavily now. You can only add 3 expenses a day whereas before it was unlimited. A slightly higher expense count would have made this a half decent app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They put a limit on how many can you add on your expenses (3 max) before it was unlimited. They are forcing you to pay. Will be deleting this app and look for a same app which is better than this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There was no other app in comparison with splitwise for spitting bills and expenses, however the recent changes done by them that you can only enter 2 expenses at a time makes this app really useless for all of us. Giving extra features with pro subscription is understood but not allowing users to use it for it's core function is really not acceptable. I hope they go ahead and bring back the older version, untill then switching to other app 🙁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise Pay is a dumpster fire with the obscenely low withdrawal limits + long transfer times, and now the in-app ads and transaction limit per day have pushed me to realize the good times with this app are over. Rest easy, Splitwise - you were great while you lasted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be so good but now I am just staring at a timer until Im allowed to make an entry, or it doesnt let me enter anything at all because I have no entries left for the day. Time to switch to another app that doesnt hinder you from using basic functionalities in order to pull more money from you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Magnificent app. Uki, Jovke, Sica i Emilito. Much love!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until last update that basically made it useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Use to be a good solution, now it's unusable without pro. Not recommended anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app but the balances being shown as owed are wrong which defeats the whole purpose of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you're charging me to add expenses! That's sucks!!. This app used to be good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update sucks ! Really? Just 5 free entries per day? What if someone is adding all expenses together ? Please dont make the app so much money-centric or else everyone will switch to its alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription ruined it for me. Can't add more than 3 expenses a day. Bakwas. Uninstalling the application today"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limitation in daily use, will not make it last long, may be you could have decreased free usage slowly, but decreasing that drastically will not make you to attract new user and it will eventually decrease existing user in long run."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was so awesome at first but For revenue generation they messed it up by adding the limit feature. Now going back to other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great, didn't mind the occasional ads and just kept my expenses on the app along with splits I had made. Now the app has a forced timer for any function that says upgrade to pro or we will annoy you to death. This is just the developers indirect way of saying ""We are shutting down the app and we will milk it as much as we can before abandoning it"". Just a public FYI notice to anyone who thinks the app is free to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't think it is worth paying 1000rs yearly to manage expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription amount is too high"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but new restrictions to force premium make it unusable. The technology is too basic to merit premium charges it's basically a glorified calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app used to be good but now all it asks is money. Why do we have to wait for a day to enter expenses?? There are far better and free apps that do not have a daily limit of 3 expenses 🤬"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"how to destroy your reputation, sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ich finde die App super, nur schade, dass es keine Einkaufslisten-Funktion gibt. Das wäre noch das Sahnehäubchen auf der Torte."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You are digging your own grave guys. No one wants to pay literally for splitting expenses. Atleast come with a plan to provide the customer if you are charging for something. Your alternatives are only going to be benefited from this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using Splitwise for half a year and was happy about it. Suddenly I get a ""you've reached your daily limit"" popup asking me to pay. As I see it this is deceiving as I had no previous notification about such a change. I'll probably search for a competitor and pay them from the beginning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It should not limit daily expenses. Not satisfied with latest update as its restricting limit per daily. Latest update for sure is decreasing customer faith for splitwise. I am an user from 2013 but unfortunately this is asking me to get it uninstalled. 😔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"2 expenses per day unless you £4 a month. Killed the app. Will use an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit makes this app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This absolutely brilliant..just soo simple and work so well they have thought this thing through such a life saver."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable for free users now that it's become paywalled. I use this app maybe about twice a year to settle expenses for trips, and that's about it. I'm willing to bet many users are the same. So a one-time payment is not unreasonable, but why would I even consider a monthly subscription fee? This was a brilliant application, but now that I can only add 3 transactions per day, it's pretty much useless. Hope yall are doing well, because this move is going to tank your userbase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly Got restricted to 3 entries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely destroyed thanks to the new update. How can devs be so greedy? At least give us an option for a one-time lifetime purchase instead of forcing users into a subscription model. Hope you get review-bombed and bleed users. Sincerely, screw you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, now barely usable, making users wait 10 seconds just to put in an expense. Deliberately making the free experience worse instead of offering reasonable pricing ( 45 euros a year is not affordable !!! ) Or added value in the paid version. I will be migrating elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Notification content need some modification and should be very understandable to user........"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be super efficient in keying in expenses [no limit] but after the latest update, it is limited to only three expenses a day. Which forces you to upgrade to Pro. Will no longer be using this app if this function does not change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but after they implemented a 3 transaction limit per day for free users, it's become unusable for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for expense tracking with group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for payment 😞"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is a joke! There is no way to deduct payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise recently made some user unfriendly changes to their free tier: timed waiting to add expenses and a hard limit of ~3 expense additions per day. Have been using this app for a little over a year but majorly considering going back to one of their competitors OR just creating a shared Excel sheet. Anything is better than the current version of splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest usage policy changes for the freemium version have made the app practically useless. AD's, Limited expenses can be added etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows to add only 3-4 expenses per day. LOL. Time to search for new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"our house manager runs the group sliptwise. all I have to do is click 3 or 4 times and that's it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly it's paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor practice suddenly useless for free users, moving onto another app for same use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Huge pay wall all of a sudden. I can only add TWO transactions for free a day. What a joke. This app sucks now find another one that won't spam to upgrade to premium and limit your ability to list finances. Not even using the transfer of funds there should not be a limit. Will be removing from my phone. Shame on you splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Your limitations is way too over"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but the new changes make it unusable. Incredibly disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star because the recent update will only let you record 5 expenses, and there is a 10-second wait between entering each expense. Really??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now it's all paid and you can't do anything, basically. And way too much money for subscription. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Früher ein super Tool. Aber dieser Blödsinn mit Wartezeit und Tageslimit ist wirklich dreist"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good before but now you can only add 2 or 3 expenses maximum per day which makes it useless for me in most situations (when on holiday for example, so many more expenses to work with). Not a smart choice for the developer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Pretty good app. The fact that you need the persons contact before tracking how much they is a bit annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After adding daily expense limit and 10 second advertisement this app has become useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 expenses without paying, useless app, waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing to use the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very good and easy to use! perfect for splitting costs in big groups and travelling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Time to say goodbye to this very good app. You ask for money and the competitors awake!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit of 3 expenses/day makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Long time user here. Totally turned off by the developer removing existing functionality (unlimited expenses) to make us pay for features we don't really need. They should focus on trying to add features that are really useful, like recurring expenses. I recently switched to Sesterce which is a better alternative!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is now limit for adding expenses behind a paywall. Switching to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to unintsall it and shift to better alternative. Good bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free version getting useless with each update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to move to other apps as it allows only 4 expenses entry a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"YOU ALREADY KNOW THE REASON (11/12/2023)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"really love this app, the free version gets what I need most done. between me and my friends on trips we are constantly splitting bills and restaurants or transit costs and this is a quick way to keep track of it instead of saving all our receipts and then trying to do the math ourselves. it easily figures out the net cost everybody owes anyone, I use this app monthly between me and my roommate as we split bills like wifi and electricity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Super limited ability to add expenses (daily limit of 3) since new update. Unusable, changed to Splid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense per day is pretty much useless. Hence this a paid app now with annual fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"all it took was this app adding an unnecessary subscription service for me to do a little research into better apps. if you search for it, you'll find it. boycott this app and their greedy developers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once great app ruined by yet another subscription that's in no way worth the absurd asking price, topped off by awful communications around the change (as in no communication at all). Not even a comparison table on their website that mentions the new 3 per day limit. No doubt intended to bait people into subscribing once they're already in. Such disrespect for your users - will be telling everyone I know to stop using this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be one of the best apps for managing expenses between roommates/colleagues. They've possibly ruined the app now by forcing people to go subscription mode. Timers are added to add expenses and again force users to go subscription mode if they need to add more than 3 expenses per day. I know this review won't do much but anyone looking to use this app, just search for alternatives to splitwise which are free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable with the current limits to adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't think the path being followed by apps these days like Spotify, splitwise, is in right way. You can't keep paying bills for every app that you use just to get basic features😂 sorry but good app turned into worst now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was lovely until they locked previously basic functions behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good for flatshare or trip situations when several people are involved. Really like how it simplifies the flow, and is easy to use. Some of the accessibility (log in, inviting others) could be better, but generally enjoy this a lot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app a lot, but it has gone downhill recently. It used to let me record as many expenses as I wanted, but now it asks me to upgrade to pro after only three entries. The subscription fee is too high for what it offers. I don't need all the fancy features, I just want a simple and reliable app to track my spending. This app has become money minded and lost its original value."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Edit: shame about the sneak update and aggressive advertising. Time to move on to a better app. Dang good app for holiday shenanigans, although I did have to reinstall it once due to the app completely freezing despite restart. Simplify payments option being free is 10/10. Pro being subscription based is bleh though. BUNNIES!! (why is it still making sound even though I'm on silent lol)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, and even occassionly would buy a month of the pro version every couple of months. Now the free version is completely unusable due to standard features going behind paywalls (seriously, only 3 tx per month?). The pro is absurdly expensive considering all the alternatives and the lack of of market differentiation. Goodbye Splitwise, we had a good run."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app as it only allowe 3 txn per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't want a subscription plan on such apps which i rarely use and that too expensive. If it was a one time purchase i would have bought it. Feels too much restrictions on free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update is bad. Only 3 expenses per day. Ruined a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utter disappointed after the recent update This app used to be a boon in terms of recording expenses but after the recent update, it can only record 3 expenses per day and for each transaction i have to watch 10 sec video which is irritating. Time to uninstall and look for alternatives Download splid app, it's a good alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for years and now they added a limit of 4 expenses per day. Ridiculous, and the worst part is that they want to charge a monthly subscription instead of a one time purchase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good but after the developers limit the amount of expense posting in a day and remove the feature of attaching pics with the expense in the free version, it's not good anymore. If someone know any other good apps like splitwise, please advice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro marketing too intrusive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they completely obliterated the free tier. can only add 3 expenses per day. gonna go look for an alternative app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit sucks. I'd rather use a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately no longer useful, after daily limits to expenses. Paid version is also far too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become unusable after the daily limit for free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entries per day if not using paid version. Doesn't even have regional pricing. It's too expensive for most use cases. Sometimes I need to input like 5 entries in one day, and most days I don't use it at all. I don't mind a subscription but I can't justify paying that exorbitant price for something I only use on and off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Continuos ad for pro additionally only 3 transactions allowed in a day is utter nonsense.. time for uninstalling this ap now!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was such a great app. Even encouraged friends to get it. Now you can do nothing without paying- will be looking for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"works great. I recommend it to 10 friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used it for lot of years but now if you don't pay the app is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They seem to be gradually making it more difficult for free users to use. Paying for pro is not worth it as a very occasional user and it's becoming annoying enough to not use at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was amazing, but instead of growing functionality with different tiers, they threw everything useful behind a paywall without any warning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for 5 years then they made it worse and worse. But 3 limits per day is ludicrous. Deleted the app. The problem is there are many other apps that do this and its easy to switch to them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I cannot install. Dont know why"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pretty miserable cash grab changes on an app I've used for 10+ years. uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Arbitrarily kneecapping the free app to try to force users to pay is scummy. Offer a worthwhile benefit to pro, don't make free impractical."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for years. There were no basic due diligence of notifying their customers of the new daily expenses limit to 3 a day. Splitwise you've really shown how to ruin a great product and piss off your entire customer base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for years but now limiting 4 expenses per day it ridiculous and also pro version for all members is group is not worth. Found the replace. Thanks for till now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's a new daily limit on adding 3 transactions. Now a worthless tool for our household. Was a great app with lots of flexibility. But absolutely not worth a $5/mo subscription. I don't know if I'm more sad than I am angry at this blatant money grab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads ads ads ads ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"First only 3 additions per day and now ads before every single start and expense? Also the price for the subscription is just too high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are one think, limiting the number of expenses you can add a day is another. Splitwise is nothing special, gonna use something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now they want to push users to get the paid version with the ridiculous 3 transaction limit per day. I'm going to switch to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update is BS. Only allowed a fixed # of expenses/day and makes you watch adds prior to adding expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good to see reflected in the reviews; the recent changes to restrict to 3 transactions a day are unreasonable. I understand the need to monetise, however the functionality is really quite simplistic that people actually use splitwise for. £40/$40/year per person who uses it?! Given you must use it with multiple people gets expensive very quickly. For my household to use Splitwise will cost more than Netflix does! Goodbye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Bella interfaccia e funzionalità ma il limite sulle spese scaricabili ogni giorno (senza abbonarsi ovviamente) limita oltremodo l'utilizzo del l'app per chi, come me, non usa la usa in maniera sistematica"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can now add only three entries a day, and there's a 10-second countdown for each. Moving to a subscription model makes sense, but the new limits seem too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it's such a good application, Using it form last 2 years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a bollocks update. I've used this app for years and suddenly they only let you add 4 expenses a day and make you sit through a 10 second ad. You lost me and I'll be switching to another app or an old school simple excel file."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I dont like the colors set, please add something to change the colors of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Your app is BASIC. Simplest ever app. And it's just that. Which also means you can't ask us to pay for it. I can create an Excel sheet for all the things that your so called app does. I am uninstalling if you continue this debauchery."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When you start adding arbitrary wait times and limits to your apps free tier in an attempt to force your users towards your paid tier, you should probably ask yourselves whether this is a sensible decision. Other apps do crazy things like, provide useful features for their paid members that gives them value for their money. Just, spit balling here"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst way to add users is to remind them to pay for the most basic functionality in a payment app : Add Expenses. If business/software team needs help in figuring out the product design,please at least work backwards from your customer. Add icing to this : Watch an ad to see a banner which against asks you to pay. Seems like begging is the new marketing strategy. NEED TO FIND SOMETHING SOON!! - User SINCE 2015!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is good but it only allows to enter 3 expenses. After that it asks for pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app's latest update has limited the addition of expenses to 3 per day with is very annoying. I had been using this app since a long time but due to this feature I will have to look for other options now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Finding a new app because I refuse to pay £40 a year. New restrictions mean you're limited to a small amount of expenses per day and time delays in between. No thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The latest update made the app unusable. You can only add 3 transactions now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand they have to monetize, which they could have done with either ads OR limited use. Now a once completely free app (besides some extremely niché features) ultimately became paid-to-use. To top it off only a subscription model is available.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money leaving the app looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"WORST APP..it said first make group then add expense after 2 expense i added, it asked for subscription monthly or yearly... WORST APP NEVER DOWNLOAD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove the 3 transaction per day limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App experience has been degraded to the point it is unusable in order to drive free users into Splitwise's expensive subscription model. Don't waste your time, use one of the many other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total amount we can add in free version is very low. I and most of my friends have started to look at other alternatives to Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit to expenses makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing people to buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise started monetizing the app. Paying the premium for to view charts and other features is one thing, but limiting daily expense addition is a huge pain now. I have been using Splitwise since my college days like more than 8yrs plus. Extremely dissapointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is good. Earlier they used to give unlimited expenses to add but now they have monetize it. They only give 2-3expenses to add in a day. This app was used by lot of students who are not able to pay the amount they are requesting. I think they should atleast allow 5 expenses per ad for free use. That way they can generate lot more money since they have huge user base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Could not recommend this app less. It used to be a fantastic way to track and split expenses, but has recently put an insanely strict limit of 3x entries per day unless you pay for a plan, rendering it completely useless as a free user. Constantly makes you watch ads pushing their pro plans and wastes so much of your time. Much better options out there - don't bother!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After years of using it, now they ask for money to add more than 2 expenses a day. The subscription model is killing the software. I would lovely pay 3 dollars for a lifetime membership, but a monthly fee like Netflix for an app that takes 4 weeks to code... crazy. I am moving to tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this for years now but I was shocked when I only get to do 2 transactions a day. I don't want to pay that much money for the service I can do on other apps. Sad to see splitwise get deleted from my daily life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until the recent changes forcing people to pay for premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"can only add a small number of costs and then says I must wait til tomorrow to add more. still says that 2 days later. total scam compared to how it was before. not impressed with the new money grabbing updated version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for years, and now out of nowhere, I cannot add more than 3 expenses per day, forcing me to buy Pro version. At least should inform the users about the change, I'm out, there are many similar services with free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now the apps limit expense update to only 3/4 which makes it very inconvenient to use. Paid membership also very pricey, should just have a single off payment for premium instead of a monthly/annually package which is not very value for money either"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Loved it until you became a sellout, daily. Limit of 4 expenses? Really? I could work with ads, or atleast not the monthly payment being so damn high. Very dissapointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, however have become unusable if you are not a premium subscriber."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to uninstall,reduced daily transactions and forcing to get split pro..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging fees high"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useful app for a stag do weekend, but tries too hard to get you to subscribe. For £3.99/mo? No thanks. Would probably pay if it was £3.99 one off, but it's nowhere near worth a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads with waiting time to add an expense for a glorified calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worked great. Free and simple way to split expenses for trips, room mate situations and family spending. Recent update has limited use to 3 expenses per day. I'll just write up a spreadsheet to replace this I guess. Pro costs 50$/yr"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to switch for new app after latest frustrating update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sucks... Splitwise will lose alllll their customers. I can't believe they have changed the app to include an ad timer and a max number of entries per day. On the search for a new app. Later, Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They've now put image upload behind the paywall. Perhaps take a look at your pricing scheme first. Keep locking things behind the paywall and it won't be long before people go elsewhere. Edit: Now they've gone and show themselves in the foot by limiting the basic function of their app. Time to head to one of their many competitors. I recommend Sesterce, reasonable pricing models."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A limit of 4 expenses a day ? SERIOUSLY !! I am done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rating because of irrelevant subscription pack where if you are a occasional user still same story, adds with limit in transaction per day is too much annoying. Figuring out some alternative to switch"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why splitwise team? what you are doing to your loyal users ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most recent update rendered this app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was way more useful before they started limiting features under the payment wall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are forcing me to pay . Only two expenses are allowed per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is of no use and is little irritated after they stopped free version. I feel a WhatsApp group ( without anyone) will serve the purpose"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Going to have to change to a different app. They're going to lose so many users with the new fees."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a happy user for seeveak years. They just added some weird limit on adding expenses... Will be looking for a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the new daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the limited number of entries. Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Assim como dito nas demais reviews, o app na versão gratuita ficou completamente inútil."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable unless you pay now. Finding an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, but now paying a monthly fee is basically a requirement to use it. And there is no one time purchase option. I will simply look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the hell this app is doing. Really just 3 expenses for a whole day. Why even 3, just make the whole app a paid app and earn whatever you want. And after that Rs 149 per month. Are you kidding me? These calculations I can do in seconds. Just to save those seconds I downloaded this free app. I would donate but won't even think to pay money for this feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app is superb. But, it would urge you for a subscription($) when you get used to it. Easy khata from Pakistan 🇵🇰 is a Good alternative for me. Thank you Splitwise for the time I used you, you were useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most loved app started becoming most hated app ever. The idea of 4 transections per day is ridiculous. End of Splitwise is here!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Honestly, it used to be a great app and helped with expenses. However, you can only add so much in a day now, and it keeps asking to pay for premium. Again, it used to be a great app, but I am now looking at using a different app. Should be ashamed Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was free and now they are forcing us to use pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 expenses a day, worst thing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seems like the splitwise era has come to an end. Awful now that there's a daily limit and the premium prices are absurd."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now unusable unless you pay..max 3 transactions per day. Found a better free app will be uninstalling. I get they want to make money off the app, but there are better ways then making it totally useless unless you pay... gl to the developers, they just killed their app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update which allows only 4 expenses to be added is ridiculious .. Makes the app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app just became not free one day. ""Genius"" decision from managers. Good luck in getting all the clients back"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now expenses per day are mid to two and it makes me wait 10 seconds before I can enter even one. The app is becoming useless now. I would glady pay for this app, but certainly not a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until they have started allowing no more than 3 expenses per day 😶 and premium plan starts at 130 Rs pm(which is pretty high india, netflix comes cheaper than this 🥲). Terrible update! Stop this before we stop and get a better alternative #honest_suggestion"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This has to be the worst strategy limiting 3 updates per day and people have to wait for 10 seconds to forcely buy premium subscription. Everyone will move to different apps as this change will make this app useless. There are so many alternatives for this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dear Spltiwise team. There tons of better ways to offer paid features. Limiting an user to just 3-4 allowed expense additions per day is the worst thing that you can do to force people to shift to pro. It will only result in loss of users for you. Increase this limit to atleast 10 per day atleast to make it sensible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horondous user experience after the latest update. Limit on adding expenses per day is wack. I am already looking at alternatives. Bye bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used the SplitWise app for more than 2 years continuously but the time has come to finally delete it. Never imagined such cheap greedy forceful marketingthey would do. Now every expense you try to add theyshow you a 10 sec promotion of their pro version.Okay, if you can tolerate it still they will show the truecolors... You can't add more than 3 expenses in 24hrs. Woww! And those 3 expenses too at the cost of 30sec ad watch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent updates have made this app unusable. Having a limit to how many expenses you can add, stare at an ad, or else you can't add expense. Change log only states ""bug fixes and improvements."" Description doesn't state the new changes either. Well, it looks like I'll have to find an alternative. Great app at first, but it looks like corporate greed is catching up to this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have happily used Splitwise for years so I was disgusted to find I could only add 3 expenses today without being slammed to upgrade to a paid subscription. So long Splitwise, I can build that functionality for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day is an absolute ridiculous joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be perfect for trips and long-term expense sharing. However in their latest push for the ""Pro"" version (read money-grab attempt), they implemented a strict 3 transaction/day limit for all free users with no warning. I would return to this app if that limit was lifted, but it's a slimy practice to yank that ability from people who've used this app for years with little notice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly changed to an expensive paid model. Only 3 expenses per day unless paying a lot for it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The sudden pay wall implementation is just ridiculous. Used to be a 5⭐app, but not anymore...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"WONT USE ANYMORE SINCE YOU PUT THE 3 TRANSACTION LIMIT ON FREE ACCOUNT"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Logging in should not be mandatory for this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been using Splitwise for years to track expenses with my girlfriend. Ten things are added monthly, but we often add it all at once. So, the new unexpected push for the paid version has made the app unusable for our use case. I also used to invite my friends whenever we went on vacation, but being only able to add 3 expenses a day makes the settlement way worse than just making a payment request right away. I wish the developers reconsider this change. If they do so, consider this a 5 star"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not so useful as the free account only allows input of 3 activities.. Not worth paying $60/yr for what a calculator can do..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have restricted to create expenses. Did not like this. They should remove this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shouldn't have updated this app. So not using this app any more.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As many others, I will be searching an anternative. The free version has become unusable and the Pro version doesn't offer enough features to justify the price. I hope the team will realise the huge mistake made and change - I would then reconsider splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a cash grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app initiative now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add expenses in my splitwise account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent change to limit expenses to 3 a day is an awful choice - makes the free version basically unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a daily limit to the number of expenses you can add is completely ridiculous, especially if it's such a low number. Uninstalling now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and it has always worked great. I don't know when they updated it to try to force us to pay for a free service we have enjoyed for years. All this does is encourage us to find a new app to track and share expenses. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. 0 stars and uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No one is going to pay 999 just to keep track of the expense. Better show us ad and provide the service. Else we will surely find some other app which can easily replace yours. 149 rs per month, 999/year, seriously, r u even for real??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, recent changes have really nuked it's value, will look for a different solution soon I think"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst update, limited to 4 expenses a day. What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the latest update is absurb"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app, but adding daily expense add limit(2 or 3) was a big mistake. Worst part, it came as a surprise, without any notice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after last update. Suddenly not able to add more than 3 expenses per day without paid subscription, disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they started playing 10 seconds ad to purchase split wise pro when you click add expense...this is super annoying and forcing customer to buy the Pro version...a real shame...it was good earlier, now it's a cash grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After updating you can only add 3 transactions per day. And subscription is 149rs which is insane. Pathetic!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why there's such a low limit on entries per day. Borderline unusable, forcing users to pay for such a simple app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to three entries per day, bug cash grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the new restrictions, me and my friends have all switched to an alternative - Tricount, which offers a good user interface and similar functionality for free, and I recommend everyone else to do so too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"One of the best apps for sharing expenses with a couple or group of friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise team got GREEDY! Charging such a hefty amount and limiting the features in free version is absolute non sense. They should have added ADS only, but forcing to pay for adding more than 3 expenses is absolute nonsense. They don't realise that they are now going to lose a lot of consumer base, due to such GREEDY and Non sense step they have taken!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asks for premium after 3entries/day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total bhangar, bolta 150 hai rupaya do toh raaz ki baat btaunga. This app will disappear in 2-3 months from world."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How can the devs be so greedy and think about making only 3 free(with 10 second unskiplable ads) expenses to add when this is your only feature. No one uses this app for anything else. And to think someone will pay 150 per month just to manage these expenses, you are out of touch. Can't wait for you guys to roll back this change but will be deleting splitwise soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Makes keeping track of who owes who money for what so easy. But it would be awesome if we could add a person without having to invite them to Splitwise. Makes it easier for tracking small IOUs without having to add the other person just for one or two things. Also, having a feature to mark specific items as settled for people who like to pay back certain things at a time. Update: They added a daily limit to how many expenses you can add. Booooooooooooooo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why the hell are they limiting people to 3 transactions. What a waste of a good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy app makers. Now Splitwise asks to buy their subscription to add more than 3 expenses in a day. I have been using this app for 5 years now. Never thought it would get this low to make money. This is same as greedy YouTube detecting ad blockers to make more money. I would prefer Splitwise to be ad supported than charging money. I will be now moving to away from Splitwise to other free or ad-supported apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the latest update with the limited expense inputs per day, it has become one of the worst apps to use with friends. Everyone I know has moved on, hope splitwise remediates this idiot move and maybe I'll consider coming back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The New limits are bad... A warning would've been nice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"IT'S NOT FRRE. only 9 entries are free per day. It's not good. I promoted your apps in many groups and now they are complaining for limited entries. ONLY 9 ENTRIES ARE FREE AFTER YOU NEED TO BUY PRO VERSION THEY DIDN'T MENTION IT BEFORE!! OTHERWISE I NEVER USED THAT!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Being using this app for years and just now they paywalled the main function at a ridiculous price tag. Really stupid move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely poor decision making in addition of daily ""free"" expense limits. It makes the app completely unusable for tracking expenses in general usecases for group trips and roommate expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They change the base app so you have a max of three expenses per day. Been using it for years. (And yes you pay in some way with your informations). Very disappointed. The whole groupe of friends and family will be out in no time. Goodbye split wise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for many years but recently it's now forcing full screen ads for the premium version that you have to wait to dismiss, and worst of all they limit the number of expenses you can add in a day. Terrible. It's a shame as it's been an incredible app for years. Time to find an alternative. Would accept a small one off fee to bring back the normal basic app with number of entries per day and zero ads, but the pro tier is too much when I don't need/want the other features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Who charges money for every entry!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"app was perfact but it was not generating revenue so now they're forcing it to be paid one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Now became unusable because of money hungry company."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add names without emails, free accounts have to wait 10 seconds, and are limited to 3 transactions/day. I guess they want everyone to leave. They should really re-think their business model before it's too late."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A previously 5 star review is now 1 because of the recent changes. The limit on transactions per day is nonsense. This is a standard feature of any similar app and should not be limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but as of a few weeks ago they instituted a 3 expenses a day maximum on the free version. In that case, you might just charge everyone because this is unusable. Had my entire household expenses there for a while and now can't use it. A really bad business move, especially when alternatives such as other apps or just a spreadsheet work just fine instead of paying you $2+ a month which is just not worth it, especially when you treat your users with such disdain."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointingly I will have to stop using this app. 3 expenses per day limit? What a joke! Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is useless now with a ridiculous limit of 3 expenses per day on the free version, which it had always been until recently. What is the point of using this on a trip anymore? Time to completely switch to Tricount, which does the same functions for free. Really disappointing, I had been using this app for years on trips with friends and will now have to uninstall it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Getting worse all the time. So much functionality disabled to push you towards the ""pro"" version. But way too expensive for the odd trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seems like the era of Splitwise has come to an end... I remember using it in one of my first trips in 2013 and it was a app of choice I used to recommend to all my friends if we were talking about splitting expenses. Not sure whether the management has changed or what happened, but that's how it is, I don't believe they will revert it. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and a 4 expense daily limit? Absolutely bogus and foolish change for an app that was terrific until now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very annoying of allowing only 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really, really bad freemium model transition. I was considering it recently but no more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update does not allow more than three attempts, and the Splitwise pro option does not let you take the subscription, returns the amount as soon as it is deducted. In No way you can use the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions a day is wack"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to move away... Sorry... Of course everyone wants to make money, servers don't run themselves but would prefer more features with a few ads..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please atleast look at your last 1000 reviews on playstore and TAKE A HINT !!! Who makes such decision 🤔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great way to track expenses between a bunch of people!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Da quando è a pagamento è inutile."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wtaf is this new 10 second delay and limit on new expenses? Anyone know any alternatives?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for years. Now introduced ridiculous daily limit of three expenses per day on the free tier with no warning"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"good until recent updates charging money when users can switch to free of cost apps available in the market"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lamo, making me wait before adding an expanse? Are you serious? There are alternatives and what you did renders the app unusable. That's sad, whoever made that call should be fired and never work with products ever again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new 3 expenses per day limit is a bit ridiculous. There are other ways to boost revenue on this app, without destroying the user experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very efficient calculations & easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Have to edit my review dropping it to 2 stars because of the senseless 3 expenses limitations they've added recently. Too bad because it was perfect for my needs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be a good app now they just want your money!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now with the 3 expenses per day limit it is useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ideally I would give 5* but due to the latest update where app allows you to only add upto 3 expenses a day is worse part. I would recommend to add a 3sec add if needed. But restricting to add expenses is the most foolish move. We (Friends n Family) are using this app since 2016 but now it just seems ""useless"". Please find another way to earn money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limits daily expense inputs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid version seems to be too expensive, all of a sudden limiting transaction limit to 3 and expecting to pay is mindless trick."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Entry limit paywall behind pro subscription is really the worst decision they have ever taken, useless app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise makes keeping up with group expenses so much easier. The payment methods also make it super easy to settle. You can settle per group, or by person. You can set recurring expenses for split subscriptions. Full featured and highly functional!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient, hassle free, documented, unambiguous mode of accounting! 👌👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"out of nowhere they decided to limit the number of expenses to three per day. how useless that is?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hardly ever rate apps on Playstore, but I gave a 5 star to Splitwise. That's how useful the app was to me. But now it is allowing me to add only 3 transactions per day. That completely changes things. If they don't revert this policy, it will be a deal breaker for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Excellent and have used for years up until the incessant ads and sudden LIMITED AMOUNT OF EXPENSE LOGS PER DAY"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too bad that they introduced a limit. The pro account is expensive with very limited features that are actually used for daily use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"U guys charge too much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update about ads and adding only 4 expenses per day, sucks! Splitwise used to the best app for friends group on the market, but I guess it's time to move on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding an expense limit to force us to buy premium is a scummy move. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has an excellent interface but is unusable because now they want to be as expensive as an Amazon prime subscription to be of any use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I dunno hey. Used to love this app and then they suddenly changed that you can only add 4 expenses per day. Meh. Pushing you to buy pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is now useless without paying for their subscription there are many other apps that are free. Don't download this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Solía ser una muy buena app. Derrepente limitaron la cantidad de gastos que puedes cargar a solo 3 por día. lo cual es un chiste y hace que la aplicación sea casi imposible de usar. ¡Ya no la recomiendo!."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a maximum of 3 daily transactions which defeats the purpose. You need to pay to have access to more. The app Tricount is as good as free. I am sadly deleting Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was good. Although the UI was lacking, it was simple. Now they got abusive limitations to force users into a yearly subscription that's too expensive. I'm not a company, I just use the basic features. I can't even buy a simple subscription with simple features. So the app is not worth it anymore. I'm moving to a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"new application after update is horrible. it now has ads before you can add transactions and limits on expenses. have used the application for years and was considering paying too. but sadly will be finding alternatives now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic qpp, requires you to pay just to put more than 2 expenses. Not recommended at all..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Looters... Asking for money after 3 entries.. Have to shift in other app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update was pretty bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Guys good luck to kill this before useful application. Switching to alternative and never coming back, even if they give me money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become the useless after the update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this application since 2012. It's one of those apps I just installed on every phone because I use it about once or twice a year. This year I opened it and it wanted $40 a year to add more than four transactions per day. I totally wouldn't be opposed to a one time payment for reasonable amount, but there's enough alternatives for free that makes this one a sad casualty."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"made it too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for several years for it's basic expense splitting function. It used to be a wonderful resource for friends, roommate etc to keep track of shared costs. With their new push to get people to use the paid version I've lost interest and will find a new app. You only get two free transactions a day and you have to watch a ten second ad in order to post. There was no warning for this change at all. Such a shame to lose another good service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"User for nearly a decade.... Decided to start charging and imposed a free cap of 3 expenses a day!!! Plus the cost they are asking is absolutely ridiculous. $37/year for an app that divides things in half... Thanks but no thanks. Moving on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely outrageous last update. Perfect app up until they bascially started forcing you to pay for the upgrade. 42 euros a year, who are you kidding?? They set a countdown timer of around 10s so you cant quickly add multiple expenses and even worse: you can only add a maximum of three a day, rendering the app useless for me. Look for free alternatives. There are enough out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Love this app, but they added a timer for non paying users. The timer locks you out of the app for ~5 seconds for no reason other than to ask you for money. This is the most blatant act of making your app worse in an attempt to get users to pay more. They should be making the app better for paying users instead of making the app worse for their non-paying user base. I will not be reactivating my premium sub out of principle."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let me request code to my email so I can sign into account. App doesn't work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app turned annoying with new daily limits. Pro version too expensive for what you get. Not worth it. Switching to a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"La han cagado con lo de splitwise pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Last update is terrible, I am going to stop using app with that type of policies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses are allowed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app wrong calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free app with wonderful management, now its just asking for money to even add and track expenses !! Disappointed !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable in the current state, where you can only add 4 expenses per day unless you have premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for simplifying life and who gets the bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for a very long time and loved it but the push for the paid version with ads and a dayly cap limit render this app useless. Very disappointed. I will just delete it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very bad update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Try finding an alternative app. This won't let you update more than 3 payment. Will ask for money. Try blazer or something. This used to be good. But of you don't let your customer use the main functionality then what's the use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Damn ridiculous with the 3 a day limit. The app is practically useless now, can't even use it on a holiday with friends. Imagine being out and about on the road and not being able to key in my expense immediately. Will be finding an alternative and then deleting the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous. Wanted to delete my account but wasn't able to because this app just didn't allow me to do so, asking me to do endless captchas etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three expenses per day is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was great but now the admin has updated the app to be practically unusable unless we pay for a premium. Now the free version is only usable 3 times and each time you will be bombarded with ads. It's quite disapppointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm glad to see the recent terrible decisions that have been made by this company reflected so quickly and brutally in the reviews/ratings for this app. They've completely crippled the free version by introducing a limit of ~3 entries per day PLUS a 10 second wait between each one. I could potentially have lived with the 10 second wait, but the limit of 3 transactions is an instant no for me. Especially considering they want $40/yr +tax for a glorified calculator/notes app. On to the next app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sudden switch to 3 entry a day limit without notice is unprofessional. Will be switching to any alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now there's a very small limit of how many expenses you can add per day. The time limit to stop you adding multiple expenses right after each other is also outrageous. Time to find another app! Or create an easy Excel spreadsheet. Splitwise should be ashamed - none of these changes were communicated to the community of people using the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limits on free expenses makes this app unusable. Only allows 4 expenses per day and makes you wait for a 10 second as for Splitwise Pro before you can add them. I don't mind paying for a useful app, but their prices are ridiculous $5/month to do something I can create a spreadsheet for? No thanks, I'll be moving to another platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It started the ads and limits the amount of entries per day. It became practically useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Force you to pay to use the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am also uninstalling this app as the paid subscription for occasional users like me is not acceptable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2018. I am sad to see that after the most recent update, you are only allowed to enter 3 transactions a day. I will be looking for an alternative app to track my expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The new limit of 3 expenses per day has made this app cumbersome, me and my friends like to gather all receipts and add them every once in a while. This is now impossible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit to adding expenses. Thanks for giving me the much needed push to find another app to manage flat expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"i have been using this for quite a while now and actually recommended it to a few people but now I dont think my wife and I can use this anymore because of the daily limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience after the adds and pro version limitations are added. There is no point now. Looking for alternative apps. Please suggest."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After recent update we can only add 3 expenses in a day.. Or need to tak the pro. Till last month app was good. Now feels very worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience with only 3 entries per day. Unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Will delete soon, as the daily limit is ridiculous, as is the premium price. $1 a month I could do but $40 a year for a service that has been free, and for a service that gets so much (financial) information from me needs to go. NOT recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Very nice app, although PRO is too expensive for me - I would pay for a perpetual. license if it were reasonably priced. The one thing I would add is the built in calculator/expression parser when adding an expense - because sometimes I have to add a subset of the receipt. The recent limit of 4 entries per day is the biggest turn off from the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the beautiful app with WHAT? LITERALLY 3 transactions per day? Bad move!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add expenses. If I am clicking on Add Expenses Splitwise pro ad is showing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit has ruined the app. No warning whatsoever was sent to users either"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"99 for a month lol Tricount here I come"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent restrictions on adding transactions makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful and good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app for quite a few years now. It was really helpful during on trips/vacations to keep track of expenses with my friends. But it's pretty much useless for me after the recent update which allows for only a couple of entries per day. Guess the devs have a need for greed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app for almost a decade with no issue, and then they decided to ruin it by introducing a limit to how many expenses you can add a day without a paid subscription. Great job folks, not like there is a 100 more apps that are free to use..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Only 3times allowed to add expenses in a day. Other than everything good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes in the basic tier of splitwise has made the app unusable. No communication was made about the new changes and they were just forced on everybody instantly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy. No questions or embarrassment just very simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update decrease it credibility."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for 5 years woth no problems. I would have given it 5 stars until today I tried to use it and they have implemented a limit of 3 transaction entries a day. No such limit has ever been imposed before. Worse of all they haven't communicated it to the customers. So the 1 star is a reflection of how much they value their customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst update ever."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update is total trash. Only 3 transactions per day, annoying ads. Even the basic features are unusable. Avoid the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a paywall to access your most basic functionality is a dumb decision i understand the need for revenue and stuff but this will only lead to loss of revenue as it will drive loyal users away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to 3 expenses per day has rendered Splitwise useless. Ads or pay is fine, but useless or pay isn't..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now that every feature is paid this app is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent caps and delays on adding expenses makes the app borderline useless. Obviously the alternative is to find a different program, not she'll put for a premium excel spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"just like every other recent review, I also have been completed put off by the ridiculous new 3 expense per day limit. it will not push me to pay the overpriced premium rate, it will simply encourage me to go back to a pen & paper method of tracking my spending with my partner. what a disappointing move for such a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update limiting only 3 expense addition per day, the developers of the app will loose huge user base. Asking to subscribe for additional features is ok, but limiting usage for default feature is just waste of an app. Looking for better alternative. Can someone suggest better alternative for users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why can't we addore than 4-5 bills per day. This is unfair that we have to buy pro to add expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is wonderful but limiting the number of transactions per day is not good for regular users. I've been using your app for 6 years. I've publicised the app and made more than 100 people to install and they almost regular users. That's not fare. Time to switch to new alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used free for YEARS to catch upon expenses with my partner. They changed it so that I can only enter 2 expenses per day! (some people get 3, but I only get 2?) Completely useless as I would pile on expenses and go through them every other month, now I have to do it every day to even hope to catch up. Will move to another app or even just a spreadsheet. Who has 6$/month/person (12$ in your average couple?) just to split expenses?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In the easiest terms - use Tricount instead. Maximum number of inputs/day AND a ten seconds waiting ad? Absolutely trash app - I've used Splitwise for over a decade among my social circle and will get the word out to not use this trash app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Complete lack of communication about their paywall and transition to ""split wise pro,"" and an idiotic pricing structure to match- why is there no family plan? I'm leaving this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits how many transactions you can add per day and constantly asks you to upgrade. Basically functional, but nothing special, and gets in it's own way trying to upsell you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty terrible now with the update limiting the number of expenses you can add per day. Try Splid instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Agressive monetization"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent monetisation of this app has rendered it completely useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupidly less number of transactions. Have some ads and make it more reasonable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great but the new free version doesnt allow for more than 2 expense entry per day which is ridiculous and basically render this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day? Should start looking at alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was the best. Now it's being deleted. I used to use this app and even told many friends and family about this app. I used this in September, and it was totally normal. But, now it requires a monthly/annual subscription, if you don't want to pay thr absurd fee, you can only add 3 expenses per day AND have to wait for an ad to play before adding every expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great, but now being limited to 3 expenses per day, plus ads, unless you want to pay per month is absurd. If there was a flat rate fee that gave you the product for life, I'd understand. But a subscription model is ridiculous. I'm uninstalling and will be using another app going forward."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is now useless. How can this app think that charging $50 per year is reasonable for splitting bills?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. The recent limitations and adds for free users just ruined the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years, recently it only allows to add up to 3 expense per day, ridiculous! I would've had no issues paying for PRO, but PRO only works for the one who pays, there is no household functionality, so if my wife needs to register expenses in our household from her end, she can only register 3 expenses, per day. This would mean I, as the only payer of PRO, would have to register everything for both of us. Time to look for another app. I would give 0 star if possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new restrictions for free users are just not acceptable. There also seems to have bugs because I'm trying to add my first expense of the day and the app says I already achieved my limit of 3 expenses for the day. I will use another app or find a new way to split my bills from now on. # latest update # free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can only add 4 expenses a day without buying the pro membership??? Seriously? Are you following the tinder model now?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiter le nombre de transaction par jour est une aberration. Votre stratégie n'aurait pas pu être pire."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop with the pro version. I can't use it for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since when do you have to pay to do literally anything on this app!!??? Taking complete advantage!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new changes to push pro are terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Users have to buy premium for even basic feature adding expenses. Worst premium plan."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After years of not making any improvements to the feature set, they've made the free tier useless to promote their subscription service. There are 10 year old posts on their own website for features that still haven't been implemented. It just doesn't seem like a team that's worth paying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple but effective app, worked flawlessly during our recent holiday."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All the limits they put on the free version of the app make an experience very bad. It's impossible to use anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now completely useless as you only can add 3 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It became so bad suddenly by introducing greediness."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For the annoying ad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App with the biggest pay walls ever!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is good. It is to helpful for bachelors who are staying in rooms they can add their expenses. So every month end they don't want calculate the expenses. It will be available in this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became a paid. Used to be good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Faced too much problem while trying to use it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting expenses to 4 per day on the free version makes this app useless to me. Been using this app for many years, and to make a sudden change moving previously free features behind a subscription model is bad practise. Goodbye Splitwise, have found alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Going to echo alot of other reviews. Can he a great app but now they have added the cap to 3 a day, what's the point? Premium version is far too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst after the 3 expense per day limitation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Echoing what others have said - app is now useless with the limit of 3 expenses a day unless you want to pay a ridiculous $40/year for Pro. I had previously loved this app using it for many years for roommate expenses and group trips. I even paid for Pro by the month here and there to use the feature of converting currency on international trips. I'll be finding an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update has made the app ridiculous, it is almost unusable with just 3 transactions per day!!! Just pathetic. Need to look out for other similar apps now!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added pay/timer walls and essentially degraded existing user experience in clumsy attempt to monetize. Even worse is the daily expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great till they introduced the daily limit..just killing the free version.. Moved to Tricount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started blackmailing money directly in the name of pro. Good bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This app has good features. My main complaint is the lack of transparency around the limits on the Free tier. This needs to be transparently published."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It does work as expected. I would like to suggest an improvement to add expenses with tax calculation while entering itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was fantastic to use as an expenses app after 3 years of usage. The recent update charges premium for the unlimited addition of expenses and it's just worst for the users in general. Will find other apps to counter this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely disgusting, terrible and disgraceful changes. An absolutely brainless decision to add a limit of ONLY THREE EXPENSES PER DAY to the free plan. I wonder if there was a single functional brain at Splitwise who saw what a stupid idea this is. Shameful way to screw over your userbase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of only being able to add 3 expenses per day makes it unusable. I'm moving away."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses a day was a ludicrous move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was great for many years. Now they limit even the number of expenses you can add to a group if you don't pay Pro version. That's the reason I'm uninstalling it and switching to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update has killed the app, 3 transactions per day and 10 sec ad between each. Dunno what the business model is here but you can essentially achieve this with a LibreOffice sheet or Google docs. $40-$60 per year for tracking expenses is a great way to kill off the main user base. It was a good app while it was usable, now it is essentially junk which will be deleted once I get my money. Will move to other free apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"why on earth would I ever pay a SUBSCRIPTION for a non-service app?! i could understand a one time fee, but asking for subscription for a basic syncronization function is pure greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very useful and productive. Should try to reduce the price to 3 times less and focus on getting more paid customers this way. It feels too expensive for just accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm all for the monetization. But basic tier should have ability to post more than 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4.99 per month? Really? Just for record keeping?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best app until they got greedy and capped it to 3 per day. So no longer usable on holiday etc. Have to spread out the expenses over a number of days..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great idea, until they started pushing splitwise pro by making you wait to put expenses in and having a max expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not a fan of the new update that limits the amount of expenses per day. Additionally, I will be fine paying a one-time fee to use the app. But paying a subscription to keep track of expenses is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just reinforcing that Splitwise has made a very poor decision to limit the amount of experience inputs a day. I'll be looking for alternatives apps to keep track. Shame I did like this app and used it for years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 expenses without pro version. Time to use the alternative app Spliit or Fairshare."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible that they are limiting putting expenses ( one job the app had )"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"without warning or informing users, splitwise's free version became effectively a trial service for their pro version. unless you can operate within a 2-5 expense per day addition (# has been different for different users based on anecdotal research done), the free version is useless. the pro version is now just the app. be prepared to pay for pro if you want to use it. the pay via splitwise can take up to 3wks to hit your bank. will be deleting this app & switching to sesterce or similar."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove add limit. Otherwise users will be gone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used Splitwise for years and it was great. The recent update that limits the number of expenses that you can add per day is ridiculous and will push me to use a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version has become unusable. You can't even add more than 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update allows only 2 expenses to be added. I usually add all my expenses in the weekend. So will have a lot. This is merely to make customers purchase the pro version. Me and my friends will be shifting to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited Daily Expense (?) Seriously?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this for years, I've always verbally told friends and family about it but that will stop. This subscription service it's forcing people to switch is forcing me to find something else. It's become unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier you didn't have competitors, now you have. And now you decided to make your app more frustrating to use for adding a simple expense. Limit of 3 per day? Seriously? And a wait for each expense. So for basic minimum functionality of casual users as well, they won't feel happy about using it. And they will surely switch to other apps. Do something about this otherwise my friends including me have already decided to switch to other apps. Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription???? Yeah right. Switching over to something else. Get wrecked."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Butchered the app with the subscription model. It's like getting a car, but paying a monthly fee for using the steering"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made life easy but then wouldn't even let me log expenses unless I get the Pro subscription. Uninstalling the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking money for upgrade..... Per day 3 transactions only we can add...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a limit to number a expenses makes this app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be my goto app until they introduced 3 expenses per day limit without any notice to users. Sad to see such a great app fall. Moving to an alternative app. Very bad move Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Atleast they should have made it free for the basic version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money after the latest update. The apps become unusable. Can only record 3 transactions a day. Also annoyed by forced ad to be watched. Time to find other similar apps. I have been using this for over a decade. But with everything restricted after the update and only few features available on the free version, i am gonna switch to another one for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has been very useful for budgeting with my partner, and would be still except for the growth in intrusive ads and limit on expenses for non-paying users. Feels like a good idea that's left the attract users with free stuff phase and is entering the juice the users that made it so popular in an attempt to make money phase. Good luck guys, you're about to learn another important lesson about keeping an audience you apparently didn't learn at Brown!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only 3 transactions daily?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"recently they added lots of ads as well as limiting 4 ads per day to improve profitability, makes it pretty much unusable, better off finding a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for years and was great for household expenses but they added a cap for expenses of 3 a day and an ad of 10 seconds between adding 2 of those 3 per day. It's sad but I'll be looking at other alternatives. RIP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went fine until hard monetization started: 3 expenses/day and 10 seconds wait time at each operation. The suscription is about $40 per year!! the same as Spotify... I'm looking for an alternative, I would pay a one lifetime payment cheaper, but $40 year is not realistic: why would you want to kill an app in this way?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have made thebpayment yet not working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After an update , sirf 3 transection per day deke splitwise ne apni aukat dikha di 🥲"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years, it's a geat app. I would be even prepared to pay a small fee, but I'm not paying 50€ yearly for it. Delusional pricing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a good app but they've become to greedy. Just google splitwise alternatives reddit and switch to something more user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an excellent app but not so much now. Everyone knows why... Sad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Reducing this to a 2 star from 5 star, recent update caused the app to only allow 3 entries per day, which is a bummer. Especially in the middle of a trip. I was ok to pay an yearly subscription, but the payment gateway just doesn't work. Neither on their website, nor on google play."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have added limit of added expenses per day. This is ridiculous and makes the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useable anymore, used to be good app, but basic function not working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved it until the latest update of limiting to 3 spends per day! Now this is utter waste for anyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free limits are ridiculous. Should be listed as a paid app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy pro, time to switch app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"29€ per year for this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was thinking of coding a simple program for this purpose but dont need to do that any more.This app has solved all my problems Edit: was long time user. Now will be moving to alternatives because of restrictions in the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit made this app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app, but they have now brought in a daily limit on the number of expenses you can add, essentially making the whole thing useless for household expense tracking. This limit can be turned off if you pay for the premium version, which is extremely manipulative. Hope they reconsider this change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As expressed by numerous reviews, the imposing on 3 expenses per day has made this extremely difficult to use and has led me to finalise my use of this app. Rather inconvenient to use now for groups and with other alternatives I won't be using this any further."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With all the reasons listed by other and faced by myself the downfall of this legendary app has begun, if just they had asked for donation I would've gladly did it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for years but now it requires subscription just to add expense. I don't have issue if you show some occasional ads but blocking completely from adding expense doesn't make sense. I will find some alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From now, it's only good for premium customers. No free usage...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restricting access, forcing to register for pro app. Unethical, we have been using this for more than 12 years now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Super practical, helps with roomates and relationships. I am very bad at keeping track and don't like charging people. This takes away that anxiety and makes it simple. Update: Having adds, limiting the amount of moves on the same update and also pushing the subscription model was a turn off. Thank you for the great app while it lasted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they change the free tier limit without letting the users know. also, it will keep spamming you until you get the premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now it's unusable if you don't pay for the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sucks now that it's paid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"awful, money grabbing experience - rendering a limited service with utterly basic functionality entirely pointless. Choose literally anything else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently drastically changed their product to make the free version worthless. Only two transactions per day are allowed, so if you are like me and settle up at the end of the week this is unusable. This was a great app I used for years, time to go to tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've been using this application for many years and I love it. The team has done an excellent job of providing all the essential features to make my life easier. I'm very disappointed with the new update! There is no option in between. It was almost 💯 free and now it's 💯 paid. Seriously, a maximum of transactions p/d is ridiculous. I have no problem paying for an app (gotta pay that talented team). But I feel like I'm being forced. There are ways to convert people, this one is rude! 5/5 otherw"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you are using it for free, you have to wait before adding each transaction. Additionally on only 4 transactions per day are allowed. They can have cheaper version for these basic features or show adds while waiting, but the limitation doesn't sound worth it. If you are a new user, find other apps before you build all the history."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As many others have said, was an amazing app prior to recent change. I would consider paying less but 4.99 pppm (so 10/month for me and my partner) is too much, considering some banks have already implemented similar systems. Raise the cap and/or lower the monthly fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not working for me any more after the update.. too commercial"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable, limiting users by locking useful features behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"After failing to find a way to monetise the app with useful features the app has been changed into crippleware. You can only add a few expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free version used to be usable and now there is a daily limit of 3-4 expenses. I put one expense in and it said I hit the limit. look for an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Feels like one of those games that look good in the ads they put up on social media, but then all they have are unskippable ads and micro transactions inside. If not for the early mover advantage, this domain would've been way more fragmented for competition to take over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new expense limit of 4 and ads are indeed ridiculous. I actually did sign up for the paid subscription for a month before this change and the features associated with it were not useful, which is probably why they chose to make the app worse. And the timing of right around the holidays (when people will be traveling and buying gifts) is extremely obnoxious. I'll be switching apps and only using splitwise as a last resort if I can't get my current roommate to switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad update, 3 update in a single day 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shameful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using it for years. Limiting charges per day is ridiculous. Id pay a one time fee but a monthly fee? Also with this new addition, there were glitches on the app because of the advertisement. I ended up having to start and delete my charges and group 3x which cause me to use up all my abilities to put in charges for the day. WTH? I can live with the adverts but limiting the use by day is so bizarre. I use this app once a month! One error and there's no way for you to do anything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app. But hate that they have now started limited each user to three entries a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went full free to play game ""wait ten seconds to be able to add an expense"" levels of monetization."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a good app, but now you can only put a couple entries in a day unless you pay $5 per month. Very large price for such a simple app. Going to go find another app to replace this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was a happy user, however It is ridiculous to limit the basic of feature to add expenses and ask to pay per subscription. I will move forward to a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to absolutely LOVE this app but they recently changed the app so that the free tier only allows for 3 expenses a day. I'm going to have to find a new way to manage my expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is impossible to use now. Pro version is really expensive... Time to look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good luck with getting people to pay £40 a year for a pro subscription. I hope the people running Splitwise realise that a simple Excel sheet can do the job (maybe a bit more cumbersome, but definitely better than paying £40). Even Duolingo, which is far more sophisticated and involves a lot more work to run charges only £60 a year, and their free version is still usable. Bye and good luck earning money from the Pro subscriptions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything was good, a perfect app I must say but after recent update....the limit of adding the expenses are only 3 which is a pathetic update as we have to add couples of expenses at once & this is a problem...Its suggested to revert this update to its original form...else you will start loosing users l, rather loyal users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good for no nonsense expense splitting but after the recent update, it doesn't let you add more than 2-3 expenses in a day. I understand they need to make money but this was done without any sort of communication in advance. Ideally, people with existing unsettled groups should have been put on a transitional plan and given a prior heads up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very limited options for regular users, this app is basically useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app for keeping track of spending with friends but they have introduced a 3 expenses per day limit for the free account. The limit makes the app barely useable for my needs now sadly. If they increase the limit to something more reasonable I'd still recommend it but 3 is ridiculous. This change feels like a shameless cashgrab to push users to the premium version. I hope it fails for them and they reconsider the changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 free transaction per day is unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not gonna pay for subscription just for adding expenses which is the most fundamental thing this app should do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise took a nosedive and ruined my favorite finance tracker app. I know you are trying to get more users but make it Ad-Gated or something plus hefty yearly subscription for just personal use is too much. I guess spreadsheet would be enough instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New changes to the app which lock basic features of an expense splitting app behind the payed version make it unusable. Particularly limiting number of expenses to 3 per day and ads for adding an expense. Will be uninstalling if these changes are not rolled back. It's a simple expense tracking app, it's not doing anything revolutionary to warrant paying for such a feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Last update is so bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The way used for monetize it is very much frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much is never enough. Splitwise is officially dead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's asking money to update how to use this I can't add my expanses anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the perfect app for splitting expenses, but now has a DAILY limit of only 3 espenses, basically makes the app useless. And suddenly putting the basic essential functionality of the app behind a monthly paywall without warning feels extremely anti-consumer. I would recommend looking into alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent app update reduced the number of expenses. It's not fair! Please change it back, or we will uninstall this app!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thank you for making it a pro app. Uninstalling. Better to use gpay or phonepay to split expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They will loose their market real soon with the recent bizzare update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a nice app till last update, now it has 3 expenses per day limit? Are you serious? Will switch to some other app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"excellent app, horribly dumb monetization strategy. making your app unusable for long time free users is just going to result in people deleting their account - as we've just done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limits make app unusable without paid subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it's a ridiculas application now,why one should pay to use this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily expense limit has made this app completely useless for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth it with the new billing plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App become unusable with last update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, always ask for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Has become unusable after the latest update. It's okay to give ads out but why just hit the functionality of the app. Can't more than 2-3 expenses in a day anymore. I'm done with this app, uninstalling it right away."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Same reason as others. Make it unusable for free users. Shocking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can wait sometimes for 10 seconds but limit of 3 expenses is such a bad update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless advertisement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is unusable after the latest update. Been using this for almost 10 years. Will have to look for an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made the app worse. Without a subscription we can't add more than 2 expenses per day. Forcing people to pay for a simple feature like adding expenses. I thinks it's time to search for alternatives to splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can't use the latest version of the app since it forces you to upgrade you to PRO version which has a paid subscription...I strongly recommend Splitwise team to continue the basic version with limited features continue for Free...else users have multiple other options to opt for"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstall. This app is useless now. Forces to watch ads and you can only record 3 transactions per day. Waste of time and money. Greedy app creators. Your app will soon see its demise 😈"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now forcing me to subscribe to pro, and it's not really cheap for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update has killed this app. It used to be really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app in the past. Not a wise choice to break usage for non premium users. I'm currently looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro version after adding 3 expenses. Other splits apps offers unlimited expense adding while this app only offer only 3 expense adding."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a fantasy so this was, so helpful with couple and trip expenses to keep track of paying each other back. Particularly loved the simplify debts feature. However they now charge if you want to add more that 3 expenses a day. £30 a year each. Sad to say I'll be using a different app or online calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years, and now they make you wait 10 seconds between adding expenses and limit the number of expenses per day. Guys, you can add new features and make it premium, but to roll back access to basic functionality, it is not great for your engagement with customers. I understand that you have you need to make money from your product some way, but you could have done this better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just read any of the crazy amount of recent reviews regarding the recent change to force users into paying for pro if you want to add more than 3 expenses per day. Absolutely ridiculous to shove years of great experiences with this app into the trash in one update. Who proposed this asinine idea within the company? It's a sure-fire way to lose users real quick. I wouldn't have minded more ads as opposed to this. I hope Splitwise reconsiders. In the mean time, I'm off to find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Era una excelente aplicación, pero desde la última actualización ya no es útil, lamentablemente la dejaré de usar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new push for buying Pro, without have any consideration for pricing in India is pathetic. Stop copy pasting same tactics from USA to India and actually study like netflix/ Apple music have done in applying their premium prices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Random ads and forcing us to upgrade to pro?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not using anymore...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lol... What everyone else is saying about the ridiculous limits, excuses and zero communication."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a fantastic app, now the free tier is useless. Their considered paying for it a few years back, but they barely released any new feature in the past 5 years. Bye bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Instead of a daily limit of 3 expenses, please consider changing it to a weekly limit of 20 or so. Or offer a one time payment plan. This current restriction makes for an awful user experience for the vast majority of people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limits to only 3 expenses per day kill this app. Use Splid instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is absolutely disgusting and frustrating now. Only 3 free transactions per day. There are tons of other apps which does the same for free. Time to leave splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Useless without pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very worst app, too many ads and daily limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The marketing team has just spoilt the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Atleast we should be allowed to record more than 3 expenses. I am really unsatisfied as I have been using it for almost 2 years now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The users will soon leave this app due to the new update having limited daily use and 10s ad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I agree company needs to earn revenue, but restricting on number of transactions one can add, seriously!!! I had to delete your app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't support the push to payment model. Have gotton worse"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is not accessible to handle add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New enforcement to buy the pro version is terrible..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this for years and all.of a sudden they limit it to 3 expenses a day. Disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily transaction limit makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great job removing the most basic feature for adding expenses in the free tier without any notification. Moving to a different app for sure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Simple corporate greed is visible for this app at this point. If you need money, add an ad somewhere or maybe a one time fee. 4.99 per month? Either SplitWise has lost its mind or the marketing/business people are just too greedy and would love to see their app going to trash. Bye SplitWise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making people to pay for splitting their expenses seems like a crime"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest limitations make the app unusable, I'd be happy to pay a one time fee for this app or even $5-10 a year option for a mid year option. At this point I'll start searching for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit sucks and if that's the case I will start using some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limits imposed to push to the paying app make it almost unusable: 10s waits to add an expense, max 4 per day. Would not mind paying a few euros to get the app (which is basically a glorified calculator) but an expensive subscription based model is just ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limitations on free users are just awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version of Splitwise is useless. Having only 3 expenses as daily limit is a very bad move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good until the last update. 3 transactions a day kills it. And what's worse is the borderline unethical manner of adding this in without giving the users a heads-up. I'd be fine with a one time fee or ads so they could monetize it but expecting people to pay $30 a year for this is insane. Looking forward to venmo killing this app for good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ad after every expense added is ridiculous, and being able to add only 4 expenses in one day is not okay. Giving premium versions is fine, but the basic features must be free of cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App demands payment to exceed two daily expense entries. With this restriction in mind, it's certainly time to opt for a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can add only 3 times in a day. This is so frustrating 👿."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying anything ☺️ revert the restrictions!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed by the daily three limits introduced. Soon finding an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An expense limit? Are you serious?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow! Been using the app since years and suddenly today I see a limit of adding expenses per day with no notification or communication. Gonna soon make my friends switch to a better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Being too greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No willing to pay premium then not worth downloading"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thank you Splitwise team. Became too commercial"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great until it became useless due to a limit of 3 expenses unless you pay £30/year. Guess we will switch to a different app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"brother in Christ just increase the limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bug often, bad app, data loss,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making it paid was a really bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are now limiting how many things you can add in a day. Was not the case before. Very frustrating when I do not add things everyday and need to pay someone ASAP. Let me watch an ad at least"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing App! But the new limit of 3 expenses per day make the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great idea but now has started making you wait to add expenses and has a max limit per day. They want you to pay a subscription to restore basic functionality - absolute joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit to expenses is forcing me to give this rating. I've been using it for a decade but this new limit/feature is killing it for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now we need to pay a lot of money to use, if not we can include only 4 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous the 3 transaction limit. Shot yourselves in the foot there. Time to search for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Following the Twitter handbook of how to destroy an app. Pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense per day for free version!!! Terrible decision. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing it to 1 star because it'll make you wait before you can add an expense and if you don't want to then you'll have to pay. There are free apps out there that will let you add expenses without waiting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now with the new update and only being able to add 3 expenses a day, with a hefty cost to upgrade for lots of features most people don't need. Very dissapointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App switched to only paid and wants payment for tracking expenses. No other service provided. Time to leave the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for 10 years but what we get is a sudden change without any notification. We are limited to 3 transactions per day and the premium charged is ridiculous, especially when there are so many equally good alternatives. I understand the monetisation, but why limit the basic functionality of the app for free users? I don't mind ads, but limiting is just pathetic. Uninstalling and getting my whole friends group to migrate to a different app that cares about it's users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good straightforward app, but the free version is extremely limited to the point its unusable. Will be moving on to another app...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing my rating because of the three transaction limit policy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new changes and limits to posting expenses has made the app basically unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Immer zufrieden, immer genutzt - inzwischen wird man zur Pro Version gezwungen. Byebye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The last update just broke the functionality of the app by moving basic functions into premium tier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With restrictions applied, unless the Pro version for 30 eur yearly(!) is used it is unusable. So unless this is changed, I will be definitely deleting the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible decision on limiting three transactions per day without any prior notification. I'm in the middle of a trip and being forced upon this change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous subscription model. Please find a new CEO while we find a better splitting app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fantastic app, not actually usable though with the draconian restrictions on free usage. Unfortunate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limits how many expenses you can add per day in an effort to get you to buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for subscription after every addition and only allowing 3 transactions per day for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit of 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I thought showing ads when clicking on add expense button was ridiculous. But then I realised the number of expenses I can add in a day is also limited (I think 4 or 5). Waiting for more ridiculous features of this app 😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly limited the number of expenses that can be added in a day just to push its Pro subscription. I've stopped using Splitwise now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Get pro version to add expenses? Seriously??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Brutal change to app. App will delay 10 seconds before allowing another expense add... THEN additional restriction app will shut down and allow no further expense adds until tomorrow. Already looking for another app, sorry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has introduced a ""3 new expenses per user per day"" limit on the free tier, making it practically unusable for most use cases. This is a clear money grab trying to force users onto their paid plans which are, in my opinion, overpriced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is how you kill a great app. Last update forces you to buy pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A 3 expense limit per day is absurd. I intermittently go in and enter all my expenses at one time every week or two, so this restriction essentially makes the app useless to me. I don't want to have to get on my phone in real time everytme I buy something because of an arbitrary rule. Definitely looking for a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now requires a subscription to use any of the basic features. It's a shame how a bad marketing decision ruined a once-good app. Due to recent changes, you can split only three (3) transactions per day without paying a monthly subscription. This app provides such a tiny amount of utility that you'd be better off using a calculator app instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After years of usage, suddenly there are unavoidable timer ads and limit on number of expenses per day. App is useless now. Forcing pro subscription won't retain customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads I can tolerate but putting an arbitrary limit on how many times you can list your expenses is utterly moronic and a shameless money grab. What is wrong with you people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So basically, I would never recommend anyone use this app as it is right now. A freind suggested we use this app to calculate the shared expenses on a trip. I didn't understand how it's possible in the current state (3 expenses logged per day if you don't have a monthly plan) and it turns out her version doesn't have that requirement. A real shame when a beloved app ruins the user experience for no good reason."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is useless you want to pay $5.99 a month to do something a spreadsheet can do that's a little less convenient. Rip off app don't waste your time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you can only add 4 expenses per day with the free version. Time to uninstall splitwise and find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the limit on transactions by day is bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lol. Lmao even if they think they're worth paying per month for this trash. Forcing ads on me and limiting transactions per day just means I'll be finding a new, better app to replace this heap of bs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use this all the time. They added a super low expense limit and crazy ads for every expense added without even having the courtesy to notify long time users. Delete immediately move to Splid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise sucks big time. 10 second interval between adding expenses and keeping a daily limit on adding expenses is ridiculous. Your business model sucks big time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of transactions as a daily thing, is the worst decision I've ever seen a free app make. I understand they want to make money, if I have to watch an ad between each transaction, fair enough, but this change makes the free version literally unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate you splitwise for monetizing the app in the worst way possible. I'll make my own splitwise FU."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously, which genius made the call to limit the number of expenses that can be entered a day? Bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grab app, useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm using splitwise since 2017. Great app so far does bill splitting, group, expense. Recent update not allowing the 3+ expense to add in list without subscription is just downgrading the default functionality. Asking for specific feature use is fine but not allowing without paying is just not expected. Time to switch to new app. It was good till it lasted. Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update basically killed the app overnight. Definitely not willing to pay a monthly fee to have my expenses split. Either I am not the target market or management has grossly overestimated customer willingness to pay using this business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent Splitwise update, limiting expenses to 4 per day, disappoints loyal users. As a faithful user for 7 years, this change feels restrictive and disregards user needs. Disappointed, I'm exploring alternatives that prioritize user experience more. The app's charm was in its flexibility, and this update undermines that completely."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best programs I used, but in the new update you can add up to 4 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new practice of only allowing three expenses to be added per day is a joke. I'll just make a Google spreadsheet to replace this app in 5 minutes. You had a good run"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the pricing of the product sucks. deleting this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst after update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for tracking split funds. It is easy to use and keeps account of who has spent what and who owes what. Well worth a try. 🙂👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version now allows you to add only 3 expenses in a day which is a ridiculous way for forcing people to pay for the premium version. Been using this app for 7+ year, I guess it's time to find a better alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shocking business decision. Just show adverts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have made it a lot expensive for a simple expense app now that they have built a user base. We dont even pay this much for a streaming service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit to add expenses? Free version.. time to move on from split wise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"5.99 per month for managing bills? Overestimating your worth much?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can add only 3 expenses per day. It's time to move to an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing you to pay for pro service without notification and the app becomes useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously a good app but after they changed the amount of expenses you can add in a day I will be looking for a different app and uninstalling Splitwise. Really disappointed with the decision to restrict free users in this way instead of adding premium features to the paid subscription that would actually justify the price."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you're reading this - DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app in 2023. It has become completely unusable without paying for the premium version. Currently trying out alternatives. Splitwise blew it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until they introduced invasive ads and a maximum number of transactions. I always wanted to buy this app because it was very useful for me to manage my household expenses, but they're asking for a monthly subscription, not a one-time purchase... no way, it was good, but not THAT good. I am out. There are free apps that do the same thing. Everyone should stay clear for now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It was an awesome journey with splitwise. It really helped me a lot in my trips with friends. Although, I used it only in my trips with friends, I found this app very much useful. But after the recent changes with subscription plan, it became useless for me, as I occasionally used it. I found a better alternative and therefore decided to uninstall it. I am hopeful that splitwise team will make changes in the app to make its free version atleast useful for occassional users like me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The subscription is not shared for the group? Seriously? Paying two or more subscriptions is not an alternative.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for splitwise pro😴.. Its time for the end of this app. Rip in advance🤣🤣🌹🌹"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 seconds of unskippable ads for ""pro"" and 4 transactions limit a day in top of that is absurd. The pro version is a subscription model?! I'm uninstalling it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, sadly no longer usable with the daily limit, will be deleting and finding something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update is awful with the limit on expenses. Going to look elsewhere for an app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now unusable for it's purpose, Need to buy a subscription if you want to continue having any functionality. Will be finding another app to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can add only 3 expenses. Quite useless app now. Uninstalling now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The monetisation of this app has become ridiculous. I'm willing to pay reasonable amounts for an app, but $40/year to be a slightly fancier spreadsheet is not worth it. The ads and function-limiting have become too much. I'm switching back to Settle Up after 8 years on this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The new freemium model is stupid, finding alternatives now. Free version makes it almost impossible to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app but the push for the pro version is ridiculous. Looking for a new app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To anyone at splitwise who is reading this, I don't know how much money you're planning to make by forcing people to pay for subscription but I don't see you making a lot of money. Someone out there will find an alternate to your app and your users will move. Nobody wants to pay for a simple expense spliter. There are no barriers to entry in this kind of market, nor do you have a non-replicable USP. This was a bad business decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update of allowing only 3 entries per day has made the app unusable. Time to move to a different similar app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying to record my vacation expenses in the hotel and immediately hit some kind of limitation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish app that only lets you put in 3 expenses per day and has a 10 second timer if you use the free version. They literally want to waste your time when you use their app. Do not use. It's hilarious that their slogan is split bills the easy way. But now that'll take 7 working days..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 entries daily is disheartening"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using this since 3 years. Now a days many restrictions like (10 sec Waiting time, max 4 expenses per day, etc..)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was so perfect, I always urged my friends and family to use it but this is the worst freemium model transition that I've seen. The delay of 10 seconds is okay understandable but this limit on adding the expenses is the worst! And again, if it was one time payment thing, I might've gone with it but this subscription based model doesn't even makes sense. Anyways, I might have to look for alternatives I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand that nothing comes for free and need to monetize. But 149 per month which is very very costlier than majority of the OTTs.I am using this for almost 5 years and I am really ready to pay for a premium if its nominal considering the features.I already found an alternative and there is no point in coming back again.Many users might feel the same"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They've introduced a limit of 3 expenses per day in the middle of trip without advance warning. That's not the way to treat your users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 transactions daily after latest update. Instead of adding innovative new features to the pro version that would entice users to convert, they've basically killed the entry level new users of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, used free version for years. Now they have crippled it's functionality in a recent update. Would of payed a nominal one time expense but it's too expensive as is for pro. In addition it's only useful if people you split expenses with use it. Since free version is useless. Effectively I have to convince everyone in my friend and family group to get pro. It's far easier to migrate friends and family to greener pastures and a new way to split bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only limit 3 transactions per day + unavoidable ad before the 3rd transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am appalled at the recent changes made by splitwise. I can't believe how useless it has become now. This is a really awful way to treat your users. Limiting expenses makes no sense. I told everyone around me to download it, and now it's just terrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Acha hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add more than 3 expenses. The app asks you to pay if you want to add more than 3 expenses. Need to find another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must app for any group trip. The only features missing are: gps location of the expense and favorite expense categories."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily just 3 expenses really a major reason to uninstall this app and look for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version of the app has been deliberately crippled by limiting users to 3 expense records per day. Users must now pay an insane subscription fee to use basic functions. There is no option for a one-off unlock. Do yourself a favour and choose an alternative from a less greedy developer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You removed the ability to upload simple screenshot as a proof/memory of settlement. Sad!! You want $30 a year? Can't you just charge $1 per user, per month to upload say 10 images before everyone quits using your app? How many users have you got? Did you see a sharp drop in DAU? Greedy you Splitwise. Shame on you!! This is exactly how start-ups die."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too much ad and limit over daily expense addition"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great, however it just introduced a limit on the amount of transactions you can put in for the free version, as well as a 10 second ad for the paid version whenever you make a transaction. Frustrating, stupid, not a chance worth it for the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable without upgrading to premium. Used to be great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The new update with the expense limit just pulls down the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is not wise anymore. Limiting to 3 expenses per day is a joke. Splitting the expenses was the basic function of the app but it's not anymore. Greed has it's limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Me, my roomies and friends were users for years. Now that only lets you create 3 expenses per day unless you become a pro user we are saying good bye. Whoever thought that was a good idea is delusional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for almost 10 years and I never had this difficulty of adding expenses. Now it restricts me to add to a certain limit. This sucks! Change your business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The introduction of ads made sense, but limited transactions per day? Really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for years and was a great app. Now they demand premium if you want to add more than 3 expenses in one day. Such a terrible idea."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now it's just pushing the users to buy the premium with a daily limit of 3 expenses and extra waiting times. This is awful practice, and I am glad it is getting reflected in the Splitwise's ratings on respective app stores. I was a big fan but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not a fan of the new expense limit try to force a pro subscription. Considering an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 transactions a day and each one has a 10s timer and ads. They want $5 a month from you to remove the restriction. They really screwed over existing users just like that with no warning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was brilliant. Now can only upload 3 expenses per day. Will be looking for alternatives immediately. Worst case scenario, will just make a shared Google sheet instead. Insane they want £5 per month for this. If it was 99p a month, fair enough I would pay that. This is not worth £60 per year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I agree with a number of the other reviews. This used to be good, not so much now with the limits. I would be willing to pay a one off nominal fee, but it's not worth paying the expensive subscription. Looks like the got greedy, so unless it changes back I will be uninstalling and finding an alternative in the new year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting 3 transaction per day makes this app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now you can only add a handful of expenses per day. Makes trying to calculate moving expenses between multiple people a multi-day nightmare."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great without expense cap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update has made it almost impossible to use the app without a subscription. This used to be one of the most useful apps and a reasonable subscription cost would have been great. Don't know about others but I am not paying money equivalent to OTT subscription cost to use the app. I will be moving on to anything that is a little bit tolerable than this one. Thanks for the great app. I hope you figure out a better business model than the current one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update is annoying and frustrating to the utmost level. There is only option to add 3 expenses a day which is utter nonsense. And every addition forces you to watch ad. If I have to watch ad I would rather watch the one I am forced to watch in YouTube and not waste my time here. It is asking for money, the yearly package amount is equal to something I can rather use to get an ott subscription. This used to be an app that used to make life convenient....What a huge disappointment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I, as many people here loved this app but now basic features have been put behind a paywall which is absurd, very disappointed with this change. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. Made holiday spending in a group a breeze!!! Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App became unusable after update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not expect me to pay you for adding more than 3 expenses in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gave 5 start before subscription but now it's useless...i could subcribe if it's one off but it's not worth it atm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update ruined whole fun ! Stupid feature now we can only add three times a day !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update is a disappointment.The number of expense addition per day is now limited."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this application. Using it for years. But their recent changes to what's available in the free account have spoiled the whole experience. Limits of 3 transactions per day. And ten second timeouts between adding transactions. It feels pretty insulting. Uninstalling and using a different service from today. Can't be encouraging this sort of behaviour from companies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Now the non-pro version is limited to 3 expenses per day? Is this dev actively trying to drive users away or what? The app is actually not bad but some things don't make sense. For example, saving the split ration is a ""pro"" feature? And on top of that, the pro version is a SUBSCRIPTION? Really? No, thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shows ads for every transaction. This app is useless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money hungry bozos. Much better free alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously, you're not gonna let me add an expense without paying for premium..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why is there a limit on number of expenses per day. This makes the app unusable. Kindly revert back to normal app. Ads are okay but you should not limit the number of expenses we can add in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Really sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has been destroyed by money hungry devs. 3 expenses per day? Yeah that doesn't work when you're on holiday if you dare leave the house for a few hours so I'm moving to a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible now - trying to force people to get pro by restricting usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 4 things on a day? Useless for bills now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are other ways to increase revenue then pissing off your users 🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good UI and smooth experience!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With 3 daily entry limit, the app is sure going to lose a lot of user base such as myself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A big request, please dont ruin this simple and powerful app with advertisement. please!!! Also please don't enforce as Pro 😞 All these years had loved this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once the best bill splitting app has now turned useless by aggressively pushing basic functionalities behind a paywall. Only 3 transactions can be added per day for free version? Are you kidding me? Time to uninstall and find another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling now, Terrible app now since the new update. Who's gonna pay monthly subscriptions for tracking expenses. I would be fine if the app had ads instead of making me pay for it. This app is gonna be the worst rated app pretty soon!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App doesn't record payments made from a bank."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but they just updated it last month and it has gone south. They added a 10sec timer between new expenses and set a DAILY limit of only 3 expenses. The lie they put out was that they were seeing a significant amount of bot activity and thus had to take actions to limit this. Absolutely just a ploy to make you buy into the Pro version. If bots really were an issue why not limit it to 10 or 20 transactions a day? Unlimited transactions didn't kill their servers before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Way to take a perfectly good simple to use app and turn it into trash by making it a paid only app. U deserve 0 stars for being so greedy. Don't download this garbage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Should provide free service atleast to add transactions for any number of times without adds and premium ask."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app, until it decided to limit to 3 expenses per day, which is unsable for me now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great until they introduced splitwise pro for adding multiple expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I subscribed for Pro. There are no additional features. The total amounts, details category wise, nothing is there. These features were shown at the time of subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"basically not functional if you don't pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using Splitwise regularly for years, but now I have to watch ads to use the basic function of the app? And I'm only allowed a couple expenses per day? Goodbye, Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years. In recent months they have started removing and paywalling basic features. As of now, I can only add four expenses per day. I will be moving my family to a different application as soon as I can. The free version of the app is no longer useable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 2 transactions in the free tier now..app is useless unless you want to pay for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless ever since limit introduced. Will probably watch an ad if I have to but not paying for a subscription. Overestimating their app's value."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you want people to pay, then make the app better. Bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update has limited the number of entries to 3 per day for free users. Very inconvenient as I used to add all my expenses at the end of the month. I get they want to make money, but this has rendered the app almost unusable for me. I'll be finding a new app or swapping to a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous monetization, this is a super basic app don't ruin it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I like this app and it's really been useful over the years. I am really hoping they introduce custom category atleast in the paid version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keep asking for 1000 Rs a year which is not worth at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a wonderful app, now forces people to pay for pro account which adds next to no value to the basic function. Free version is pretty much impossible to use because of ads and a thoughtless restrictions to expenses input. Recommend to find something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they decided to make the app super annoying to use unless one pays for it, it's not even ads - now you have to wait 10 seconds before adding an expense and the number of expenses you can add per day is limited (but you have to wait 10 seconds before the app tells you you can't add anything more)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The best app became the worst. Please change it asap, back to normal. Then I can change my rating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible... Just greedy to make quick bucks..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Editing after 9 years because it has become unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a great program. Used it for years. Now each member of my family has to pay $40 a year to track expenses for basic use? That's crazy. Searching for another app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update has ruined this app - obvious cash grab. Find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a cheap trick to ask money, limited the expense to be added in a day, actually that's the only functionality you are known for, a very simple one tough. There are many other apps available in Play Store who are free, like SPLID and lots more , shift to them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly there is a limit for adding expenses in the free version!!! That being the basic function, cannot be limited. Greedy developers. Very disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking to upgrade to splitwise pro just to add more transaction a Day, Like what is the purpose of this app if you can't even add 5-10 transaction at the end of the month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using splitwise since day1 but now there's recent update and the decision about enforcing upgrading to pro and lots of restrictions is annoying and would prefer to look for other free substitution and uninstall this. Good luck team"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for years, worked great. With the update the free version is unusable. Some other app will take it's place for sure. Dissapointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic functionality should be free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was happy with the app for over a year the recent update made me change my mind we can update only 3 transactions per day and forcing us to buy the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, but I thinks it's too expensive now with the newly introduced limits and all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Congrats on ruining the app! No one will pay for your subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Turned into a subscription model - not worth it anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now they are forcing us to become paid user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app before they took away what we had for years. The developers decided to exchange their user base for money. I won't pay for such a simple app that I use only a couple times a year during trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"La versione gratuita è diventata inutilizzabile: prima aveva un certo senso perchè quella a pagamento sbloccava funzioni comode ma assolutamente trascurabili mentre ora è diventata un'app a pagamento mascherata. Spero facciano un passo indietro perchè era l'unica app veramente comoda per questo tipo di servizio ma il costo della versione premium non vale la candela"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy company, used it for years, now uninstalling after the pay wall went up. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Don't download. It's a great app but recent daily expense limits have left it unusable - look elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add more than 3 expenses in a day. For addjng more either get pro or wait for next day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now everything remotely useful is behind a paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for years and the new limitations on usability (max daily entries, time delay) are a real problem. I understand the desire to monetise the app, but the outrageous subscription fee for such a simple app is not worth it. I think the price point is maybe a one off fee of £3. I'll be looking for a new app or maybe writing my own."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Who would pay $5/month for splitting expenses?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"great app with good features boggled by a company which cannot think of good monetization tactics"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Experience became pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits expenses to 3 per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app from a very long time, but recent update of adding only 3 expenses in a day has made this app useless time to switch to a new app. To developers - This is how you kill a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app.. It shows the same status for days as I have reached maximum number of expenses for the day!! So I have to choose pro.. Worst strategy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was good until, what, 3 weeks ago when they decided to be corrupt and start annoying the app users by adding a fake timewaster screen that makes you wait 10 seconds that says ""if you don't want to wait, get splitwise pro"". Also they added a daily limit for how many expenses you can add per day. ""If you want to add more expenses, get splitwise pro"" for $5 a month! Splitwise, can you not just be jerks and not resort to annoying your users to make money? That is a terrible idea."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why the heck am I being charged more for the pro version than my partner?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I never thought you guys would stoop so low as to limit the no. of transactions per day, making us pay $5/month if we wanted to add more than 3 expenses. *slow clap* If you think bullying users to pay for pro would work out, think again coz I'd rather use another app and suggest my friends to switch to that app, than pay for this basic functionality. Wish there was an option for '0' stars coz you guys deserve it 💩 just for limiting the basic thing we use your app for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? Come on..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit to three charges per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is basically useless now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very useful app. My only gripe with this app is they recently moved, adding images to an expense, behind a pay wall, which was super useful. obviously, I'm not going to pay 5$ a month to just add an image to my expenses. Also, I think this is a desperate move to remove a free feature from your service/app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit too low, changing apps. Would prefer to watch an AD and get unlimited splits for the next 24 hours or something better than current system."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They killed the usefulness of the app by making users wait 10 seconds before each expense and limiting to 3 expenses per day, unless you pay 50 bucks a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many restrictions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Recent updates for free users have added a ten second ad occasionally for adding expenses and limiting to adding three expense entries a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer worth the hassle. Now that they are forcing you to pay it isn't worth any time. The paying features aren't worth the money either."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They just put up a very annoying paywall, the free version is very limited now, can't do more than just a few update. They already had ads so pushing people to buy pro without even informing about the change seems like a very greedy move. Moving to a different app unless they change it back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was a fantastic app so far, but today they forced me to change my rating from 5 star to 1 star. The new restrictions of adding just 3 expenses a day really sucks. I have been using the app from past 7-8 years and promoted the app to all of my friends but now seems like it's a time to say good bye to Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't believe they want to charge me a subscription for basic usage. 2 years I've been using this app. Sad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am extremely angry and frustrated at the recent forced implementation of getting us to pay for this product by limiting the amount of transactions you can add and by making you wait. I agree that all apps need a revenue stream, but these are just shady practices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately they restricted the number of possible expenses to 3 per day (in the free version). This makes it unusable for trips or other group activities. Now I am very sad that I need to find an alternative. Splitwise, you are loosing a user which was happy to use the app occasionally for more than 8 years! And taking a look to the other ratings, you are loosing a lot of such users!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The newly introduced limits are way to aggressive. I understand the push to the subscription model, but limiting to 3 transactions per day make the free tier unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having happily used splitwise years for tracking expenses and splitting costs on group holidays, they have now forced me and my friends to stop using the app by implementing a subscription approach which renders many basic features off limits and makes it highly inconvenient without payment. Asking for a per person subscription when the app is designed to be used by groups makes no logical sense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is of no use now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Making an alternative of it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such an expensive pro membership required for basic features. Replacement app on the way soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using Splitwise for years now. The recent update that adds 10 sec ads after adding each expense and only able to add 4 expense per day is ridiculous. I am not willing to pay for a subscription model, one time charge would have been fine. However restricting the basic features which have been available for years is even more ridiculous. I may need to start looking for an alternative app and ask my friends to switch over as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why you guys are greedy for people's money. I have interest in taking the split wise pro but for a cheaper price, not like 39.99$ a year or 3.99$ a month. This isn't an entertaining platform to spend that much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally a waste now. Free version is completely waste after the recent update which imposed a limit of max 3 transactions per day. This is really crazy. I am at most even okay to watch ad but this kind of limitation is unacceptable. I really loved the app but now have to look for alternatives. INR 99 per month for users like me is too much. That's what we pay for Apple TV right? I can pay max 200 a year for this (only because the hassle it will require to shift to another service)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Now it is asking for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"3 daily transaction limit is a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is not useful. You can't add more than 3 expenses to split. Don't use. Don't download. This used to be a good app in the past. Bye bye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using over 3 years now and now you just added paid version to add expense. Very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very disappointed. 3 entries for a day and then asking for money. drawback...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asks to subscribe and only 3 entries allowed per day. Terrible marketing move. Not worth it 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they are asking to buy subscription for adding expences also."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic attempt to moneygrab. Really not worth 999 a year. I am willing to pay 500 as a 1 time expense. Looks like it's time to find an alternative!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Decision to limit to just 3 expenses makes it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking money now, limits the expense additions per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was annoyed with ads.... now transaction Limit ?.... time to explore new alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free Time is over 😞 Now splitwise force to buy Pro plan and price has very high..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app works fine and is very useful, but it's annoying how often they promote the pro subscription and now they have wait times for adding multiple expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and have loved it. But ever since the ipdate, you can only record 3 transactions per day with a free account. And if you want unlimited use, its a monthly fee! I could do with a one-time-payment, but monthly?! No way!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Hi Splitwise team, over the period of time people had made a huge dependency with your app for budgeting. But instead of forcing the user to buy the premium account after adding 4-5 expenses, why not you people Show ads like YouTube does. So as your revenue will not take a hit I suppose, and those who want ad free experience, they will pay for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app for splitting expenses, used it for years. Only being able to enter 3 expenses a day has me looking for other options. Limiting basic functions and moving them to an overpriced subscription is awful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are acceptable.. but why would you guys restrict us from using the app without premium? Limit of 3 per day is not acceptable. A monthly limit of 30 would also be okay, but not a daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"used to love splitwise until they decided to limit expenses and force ad watches for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be really good, the new subscription feature limiting non-subscribers use of the app is forcing me to look at different options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Phenomenal app until the latest update - limiting number of transactions/day to 3 plus adding unskippable ads has made the free version of this app unusable. Very disappointing from a platform I have used for almost a decade."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not using this app again. It is unusable due to the newly introduced daily limit on expense entries. 3 per day. Stooping so low to force your users to buy a premium. smh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses a day is a joke..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not allow to write more than 3 expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money money and money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app until recently it started forcing me to upgrade to pro or wouldn't let me add more than like 4-5 expenses per day which is total bs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Already switched to different app dnt think to pay $5 for this app ..There is too many app available in the market with a more better features..it's time to loose your customer.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why are limiting splits in the free version?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now the app forcing to buy pro version by making wait for 10 seconds after each expense, and daily limit of 3 expenses only. I would okay to pay 4-5$ per year but 5$ per month for a simple app. It's just stupid. Will move to some alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Edit - Pay walled the expenses with a limit of only 3 expense per day??? That's the dumbest idea from a PM if I've ever heard one. 10-20 would have been an ideal limit. Uninstalling and finding newer alternatives. Splitz is one i guess. Awesome concept and perfectly executed application. Immensely helpful in keeping track of the daily apartment's expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having a limited number of entries and putting ads/obstacles forcing paied options ... Cheap shot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely aggressive push to convert to paid subscription. Low limit on expenses that can be added per day along with other invasive changes that have made the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Then suddenly, with no warning, the devs introduced a limit of adding 3 expenses per day. On top of that, a 10 second delay to adding each expense. This makes the app unusable. I understand the need to monitize so they can pay the bills, but that could be accomplished by an ad supported experience, or a donation option. The only way to make the app functional is a subscription of $6/mo I donate to several apps whose devs I want to support, but $6/mo for an app is a racket."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited for 3 expenses per day, bruh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits makes this app useless. And having a splitwise ad to upgrade to pro every time you add something makes for a horribly clunky user experience. They make you wait around for no reason and ask you to pay because they purposely made it inconvenient. Just run regular ads if you need to. Don't ruin the app to try and get a few people to upgrade to something they don't want or need. Especially when it was all there before an update. There is a million ways they could have done this better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the App, wish they would add features to better track expenses similar to Axio and a mini calculator (+,-,/,*) when adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for over 8 years. The new paywall features (i.e., waiting to upload an expense,capping expenses per day, etc.) make the app functionally useless, as I typically add expenses all at once upon reviewing my statements. This, in effect, removes the simplicity of splitwise unless I choose to pay. As someone watching money (hence the use of splitwise instead of going dutch) I will be looking for an alternative. Perhaps Tab or Mint."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paying for more than 3 expenses a day is absurd. And a MONTHLY fee at that? Hard pass. Might pay a flat one time fee but not per month. Will be using another app for expense recording with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful update. Been using for several years, and the 3 expenses daily limit on the free version is insane, makes the app completely worthless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good while it lasted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads and limited to how many transactions you can enter per day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the perfect app to share expenses during a trip with a bunch of friends. Now it's been destroyed with greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just like other users, I've been using Splitwise and recommending for a very long time. Instead of a sensible one time purchase, we're now being pushed to an absurdly expensive subscription model. So long Splitwise. I'm pretty sure it won't take long for a smart developer to provide a reasonably priced alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works well until transactions per day limit of 3. Or 0 if it hasn't reset from the previous day... A crass money grab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Eigentlich fand ich die App gut, aber seit einiger Zeit kann man nur noch wenige Ausgaben pro Tag eintragen, ansonsten soll man ein völlig überteuertes Abo bezahlen. Bei mir sind das drei Einträge pro Tag. Da ich oft nur alle paar Wochen die gesammelten Kassenzettel eintrage, macht das die App für mich quasi unbenutzbar. Ich werde mich nach einer Alternative umschauen, so besonders ist das Appkonzept ja schließlich nicht..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update it's unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update severely limits features unless you pay for the subscription. Was once a great app prior to the push for paid services"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have had the app for years, it was a great product, now useless with waiting time to add expenses and a daily limit on adding them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointing update. Asking for money for such a basic thing. Another app down the drain"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage app now, only allowed 3 expenses per day or you have to buy premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit = Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added a super aggressive paywall that makes it unusable if you don't pay them $3 per month. Disappointed, guess I'm going back to doing my own math"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"5 star before the last update. But 1 star after the last update. There is nothing left for the free version of Splitwise. Users are forced to buy the pro version. Very bad experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You'll just made us handicapped."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they added the Splitwise Pay feature. It's terrible. It does the same as Venmo or PayPal, but takes longer. People can send you a payment via Splitwise Pay whether you want it or not. You can't decline it. Only the sender can. Awful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow! Daily limits and stuff? Pay or die, eh? Death of an app... Ciao."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Looking for an alternative due to the recent changes. There are now limits to how many expenses you can add in one day and ads that make you wait before adding expenses. Not worth my time, I'll make my own app if I need to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, until they added the pro mode. Now if you want to add more than 3 expenses a day it will cost you 39.99 a year...what an absolute joke. I'd rather have an ad, or pay a tenner one off for a decent app, but who can justify paying 40 quid a year for a calculator, absolute joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fake freemium model"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been a long time user and a fan of splitwise. I thought previous version with ads was a good balance. Their new model of 3 entries/day (or is it week) makes it completely unusable for sharing house expenses or trip expenses. may be ok for one off restaurant dining. Their pro account is exhorbitantly expesnive. I wish they had a lower tier for ad free, non-premium old features. But right now, they have just rudely kicked us out without a reasonable recourse"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using splitwise for 5 years now. However, currently the app doesn't work unless you upgrade and pay. It doesn't even allow you to add one expense. It's just unusable without the upgrade The all already makes money with the user data via advertisements. Now the app works only if the upgarde ( by paying) is done. How is this fair!? I mean run the advertisements but atleast let the app function with bare minimum of splitting the bills !?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day in the free version? Are you insane?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of expenses to just 3 per day is absurd. Have to come up with better monetization strategy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of limited entries per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like what many others said, app was amazing until they forced the daily limit and the costant popup to subscribe. Will remove and find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst now after the latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great free app, dont even minded the promotion, but having a limitations to 3 expenses per day is useless.. deleting and looking for an alternative. Ruined their own app with this nonsense, is unfortunate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for a while, after update, the app is terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only worth it if you plan on purchasing pro subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How and why they decided to limit the number of expenses you can post UNLESS you pay for the ""pro"" version, I will never understand. I have been using this app for years to keep track of expenses with my partner, family, and friends, and to suddenly be unable to use it, is ridiculous. This is the biggest nerf I've ever seen in an app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You cannot suddenly remove a basic feature of adding expenses. Disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of daily expenses makes this app utterly useless for free users. Paid subscription does not have as much value for free users as the app isn't a necessity for everyone at all times"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywalls, ads and new limits have made a rather good service become very bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a pathetic monetization system. I was annoyed at having to watch 8 second adds to add an expense, but I accepted it because it is what it is. But after 3 expenses if said that I reached my ""daily limit"" and to wait a whole day or subscribe. So stupid a part of me actually believes that whoever designed this is trying to sabotage the company. Time to move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good but 149 rupees per month is absolutly not worthy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Will uninstall this in few days, because we dont want to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Asking for money after adding 2-3 payments? And everyone in the group should purchase separate licenses. This is insane."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Started asking to buy pro even to ads expense and pro subscription isn't worth the money they asking for based on features that these folks provide. ...had a good run with this app ..will have to look for a batter alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage now! Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise streamlines group travel by simplifying the tracking and splitting of expenses. It's a game-changer for managing trip costs without the awkwardness of debt reminders. The app's flexibility in handling various currencies and the debt simplification feature make it a traveler's financial companion. Yet, on Android, it falls short, offering less information in the 'Totals' section compared to its iOS counterpart, an area ripe for improvement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now (Oct 2023) if not using Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What BS! 3 transactions per day?? Ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically useless now that you can only enter 2 or 3 expenses per day (on mobile or web) before it asks you to upgrade to pro. Users were not well notified of the change either."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great App! Website is even better! Thanks! Edit: Free version has become unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you add more than 3 expense a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplification extraordaire."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless after latest update -free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You dumbass' would be better off changing the monthly Pro subscription to legit 1.00$ a month. You would stop scaring away your clientele. More of us, if not the vast majority, would actually pay the 1$. Include everything at that point. If you really can't profit off 10million people paying 1$ for 10million a month, then your entire team, network, infrastructure, and development is a lost cause. Whoever made this decision needs a lesson in business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is perfect, but only two transactions per day for all groups inclusive are not enough"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is perfect. But only 2 transaction a day are not enough at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am simply astounded by the fact that the app wants u to pay to split bill amount that you manually put in as numbers. Seriously? Also asking for a premium if u wanna put in more than 4 bills a day? Im sure there are free alternatives. Everyone wants to be a billionaire these days. 😒"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like everyone else has said already - this app went down the drain when they started inserting ads everywhere, requiring users to wait for 9 seconds before they can add expense, and then subsequently blocking them from adding expenses unless you ""upgrade"" to monthly payments. This used to be a staple tool for travel. Now it's causing more headache than it's worth. Will start looking at alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three expense per day without 39.99 per year premium? BS! Paypal's going broke tomorrow?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm okay with occasional ads here and there because you also need to make money, but when you cripple the app by limiting the basic features, that's when I'll choose my exit from the app. It was a few good years. Thanks :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, but it's just premium-pushing trash now, with the free version practically unusable if you do the extremely normal thing of adding expenses monthly. The premium adverts they introduced showing up every so often weren't originally too intrusive, but it seems they've given up on being user-friendly in pursuit of profit. Don't reward developers that do this. They don't deserve your money, downloads, or respect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never left a review about an app until now that they rendered the free version completely useless. Do they really expect a limit of 3 expenses a day to be enough for... anything that Splitwise is used for (which are usually big trips and ongoing group expenses)??? Absolutely ridiculous of a change. Like others said... MIGHT be willing to pay a one-time reasonable fee, but not a monthly subscription. Back to Excels. Way too disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utterly ridiculous that we are now limited to 3 expenses per day without paying. Don't bother downloading, there are plenty of alternatives for free. Daylight robbery."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why only 3 transactions per day. No one is going to spend 1k for this basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transactions per day allowed on free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A monthly subscription for this app is unjustified. Time to find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying for adding unlimited transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update makes it feel like a money grabbing gacha game. Please pay for basic functionality. Absolute con."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro lene ke liye jabardasti krra h bhai ye to....3 months pehele tk jb m use krti the tb to ny tha aisa....best app tha tb tk to...aur abhii....shitt bann gaya h...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pushing pro very much"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"All good. But can't even add more than 5 expenses. Asking for premium account. You people are Greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the new update forcing us to buy the pro version, and if you choose not to, then they won't let you use the app after 3 times per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"- awful business practice for not letting users know about the 10 sec timer for new expense and maximum number of expenses cap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version has a ridiculous limit on the number of expenses you can create per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fee for the most basic feature and that too subscription based and not a one time payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Are you really want us to remove using this app. Please just convey it. I have been using this app since 2018 and now I am seeing they are asking money in almost all the things. Thank you Splitwise for good 5 years of usage. Definitely its gonna backfire."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"People use splitwise to save money and they are charging 999😂. Thats too much to begin with."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit makes this app totally unusable, used to be a great app for tracking group expenses on trips. With only 3 expenses a day, developers are just pushing users to the paid version. As it stands, this app has no use case in a free version, just make it a paid service. Free model now just seems like a bait and switch. Now it's a definite uninstall, consider other alternatives if you're looking for an expense tracker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app after the update with the day expense limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of expenses and charging 999 INR per year for such a simple app is delusional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor.. everything is asking money. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very good 👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If there's anything an app developer shouldn't do, it's adding a pay wall for basic interactions after years of free use. Adding expenses to the app now cost money - after years of free service - even if it's just a group of 2 people. I have to pay so splitwise can divide by two for me. Im not paying you a cent unless your service gives me something actually worth paying for. What a sketchy business model. Moving to Google Spreadsheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app to split your bills. Easy to use. But recently they restricted the number of bills you added and the paid version is toooo expensive. So team splitwise need to work on there paid version to reduce the charges."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Became waste now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have to change my rating (from 5 to 1 star). The app is useless in its free version nowadays. It allows only 3 entries per calendar day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a really good app but now they have made jt useless without subscription. Agree that they can't make it free forever but there can be a better categorised subscription model or ad support."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying to force people that have been using the basic function for free for a decade into paying for pro by actively sabotaging your own application? Wow, great business decision. Splitwise was fantastic, now it's either useless or wayyyyy too expensive for what it offers. Tricount offers the same for 9.99 yearly and there's many many free alternatives. Horrible decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Deleted. Bye, not paying for this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Kill the free tier kill your ratings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A very greedy move The new update allowing only 3 expenses..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless after latest update. Uninstalling. There are better free apps available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't find people who are already using splitwise.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"so sorry splitwise, the daily limit for expense is too much :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy people asking for money to enter more than 3 transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited functionality without subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. But its useless now since they've decided to allow only 3 entries per day unless you've purchased the premium version. Better do a market research before limiting the feature set and pushing people towards buying a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now we can only add 3 enteies per day and 10 seconds to wait after each entry..else take a pro version 40 USD per year. So basically its not at all free.. Whoever can pay that amount can onlh use the app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I cant believe they finally killed the app by asking for a subscription for literally anything you want to do on the app. Time to switch to the good old spreadsheets...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As a daily user of split wise, I owe 1000 dollar to my friend. He is in different country and the best part is I don't have to really payback. Hahaha I love when sliptwise shows me the percent of love I have to give back to my friends xD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have subscribed today for monthly payment, amount debited from my account for monthly payment but it's not reflecting in Solitwise app. It still requesting me to subscribe for monthly plan. There is no clear indication from Splitwise when it will reflect in my account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for 6 years now. It used to be great but now they have introduced limits of only 3 transactions per day in order to push people to pay for premium service. Not a good strategy because you are upsetting your raving fan."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to pay for the most basic functionality of the app when most features used to be free. For a simple app like this there shouldn't be any features behind a paywall. The types of features that you need to pay for are more for the developers being selfish rather than offering something useful that enhances the experience. I don't recommend this app and will be finding a different one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Former free user of Splitwise that loved the product. I can understand why they need to monetize their model considering I hadn't paid for their service over the last 3-5 years. That being said, the 3 expenses per day is significant enough that I won't continue using it and the pro functions don't warrant $40 per year. Best of luck on the company and until next time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging us now for using the app and adding more than 3 expenses is frankly absurd especially given the fact that this was free to use before. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro edition sucks , old version was too good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing. Now they have locked core features behind a paywall. I can only enter three expenses/day now. Useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Which manager made the call on $40/yr pricing for pro? Fire that person."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it's so stupid that you have to pay if you want to use more than 3 transactions per day, it's now became complety useless. knowing there's a lot more free options elsewhere I will simply delete the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was the go to app for splitting expenses. However with the latest updates and cheap marketing/money making strategy the user experience has gone down the drains. You can only add 3 expenses per day which is ridiculous. I hope the PO who came up with these limits did use Splitwise before. I don't think the app even deserves 1 star now. Also the forced ads are just very annoying. Splitwise, either fix these horrible decisions or be ready to lose out on all your customers!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they made the app basically useless now unless you pay for the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be great: easy to use, unintrusive, got the job done, no bells and whistles. Bought the Pro version earlier this year. I'm glad I did it because the free version of the app now has *ads* (annoying but tolerable), and it limits how many transactions you can add daily (which makes it useless for trips!), and it got really pushy about getting people to buy Pro. Me and my partner are moving away from it because of that -- it feels like the first signs of upcoming decline. Run!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been a fantastic app in past years. My friends and I used it all the time for trip expenses! I just tried using it today again and it makes you wait and view 10 second ads, but then only allows you to add like 4 expenses a day unless you pay for pro. Very disappointed and I hope they go back to the previous system."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Not anymore with restrictive paywalls. Free version is of no use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but free version now limits to adding only 3 expenses per day, crippling the experience. Would consider pro if it was a onetime purchase, but it's not worth £40 a year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App used to be great, but a limit of 2 or 3 expenses per day? Who does have only 2/3 expenses per day? It makes the app unusable. If I'm traveling with friends and I'm the pro user, I'll have to be the one adding all the expenses. So a chore to pro users. The excuse that this feature is to prevent bot does not make any sense and this limit just makes the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent aggressive push towards Splitwise Pro has made this app virtually unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to use? Really?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow, what a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise for years; they just introduced a cap on how many expenses you can enter -- 3 in a day?!--which makes the free tier completely unusable for even the most basic of users. My partner and I can't organize all our expense tracking around waiting for the tiny daily limit to reset. Will have to move to a new app immediately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made the app absolutely unusuable for free users!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not good experience after latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even add expenses without paying for an overpriced subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great. Now with the limit of 3 expenses per day, you can only use if you pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"money looting app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for a couple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding max number of expenses for non paying users has made the app pointless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"$5 per month for a balance/expense split app is crazy. Would be okay paying that as a one time payment. The free version is basically useless now. Will be looking for other alternatives. Pretty good while it lasted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Too much paid now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is a godsend , but the recent to push from them to force you buy a monthly subscription is atrocious. I am ok with paying a onetime fees for a premium version but not everything has to be a subscription!! Stupid business model ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited entries are you kidding... Wait till your competitor arrived the market. Learn from what happened to Mx player 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless after last update, only 3 expanses per day??? Goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With only 3 expenses entry per day, the app is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After three ""add expenses"" you have to buy the pro version, Uninstall in progress..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying after the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shame on you, Splitwise team. If anyone is interested, downgrade to 23.7.1 (APKMirror is your friend) and disable Splitwise auto update in the Play store. It's the latest version that doesn't impose those idiotic restrictions. Or just migrate to something else."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting number of expenses you can add to an expense tracker is the worst thing indeed. Forcing users to just wait 10 seconds before adding expenses. Such ""features"" were not conveyed through the release notes when updating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent changes are disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I wanted to give 5 stars, but given the recent restrictions of adding only 3 expenses a day is something that made me change my rating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be an awesome app. But now they are pushing to buy pro version else you only get to record 3 entries a day. Why not ad support free version instead of start losing users. I am shifting to a new app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is asking for money after 3 transaction in a day. Messed up the good app. RIP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been a long-time user happily working within the bounds of the free version. Recently, the free version has been so restricted that it's practically unusable. Look elsewhere!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Due to the recent update it is not possible to add more than 3 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now for trips without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bye splitsise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good, now it's not. Absolutely ridiculous trying to charge a subscription fee for an app that's essentially a glorified spreadsheet. What were they thinking??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App used to be good, now not worth even installing if you don't want to chain yourself to yet another subscription. Personally, I would be okay with a one-time purchase but this is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Corporate greed has made this app completely non-functional (including for people who have already inserted lots of transactions) by transitioning to aggressive daily transaction limits unless you pay a subscription fee (there were already a billion features blocked by subscription so this is farcical). I will be finding another alternative app or transitioning to spreadsheets and will avoid any and all apps from this developer going forward."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money after 3 transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too restrictive daily transaction limit. free is useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After years of using this app and using it to manage my expenses, this app is now restricting only 3 transactions per day that too with ads. The pro version is too expensive for Indian customers at ₹2500/year. Adding expenses is a critical feature of this app and restricting this is basically forcing everyone to buy the pro version. Either increase the no. of free transactions to 10-20 or allow unlimited transactions with ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and they have now limited the expenses that you could add to 3 and the subscription is too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits are the big downside of this app. Used to be great, not anymore with this kind of monetization strategy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years, but unfortunately this formerly good app has gone downhill. It now limits the number of expenses you can add in a day, and makes you wait 10s between adding them. The premium version is way to expensive to be justified. If it were a reasonable price, I would consider it, but right now it is absurd for what the app offers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now being forced to watch ads to add expenses. Also randomly pushed a limit of 3 expenses per day out of no where."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless since they introduced the daily expense limit. Switched to Tricount instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't introduce a paywall with absolutely no notice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bloody splitwise pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now they've started heavily restricting non-pro users by introducing timeouts and very low transaction limits without any warning. There many other free bill splitting apps that do no do such harsh limits, no reason to use this one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Digging your own grave."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Overall helpful. However, was limited to 3 entries a day on Android - sister on Apple could do more. Don't use Splitwise Pay - 4 days later, I am still awaiting a payment to settle. Pay directly!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For country like india, where everyone using UPI payment even for paying 5 cent .. It obvious we do more than dozen payments online in which many are with friends which need to write on split but after this update, app is just useless. Searching for alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What's with the limit to add expenses? Highly ridiculous way to make people pay! Can just add 3 expenses per day as compared to unlimited in the previous versions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Split changed their free version so you can only enter 3 transactions per day. Not worth it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Started charging $40 a year for the most basic use of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was amazing until the recent update 3 transitions a day are you serious how will people use it. Atleast give bit more Liberty Get a cheaper plan were people can do n number of transactions this might work better for the company and users but act fast Or else moving to different service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was only able to add 2 expenses before it then told me to pay for splitwise pro, or wait until tomorrow. Will start looking for another app to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience with this app , don't allow to add single expense for a day and says to upgrade to pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Android person can only add 1 expense in a day. However iPhone person can add many. Not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pls remove subscription for necessary things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor, asking money after 3 transaction was stupid. If you want to make money make some premium feutures and invite your users to choose you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used this app for years with no issues. Recently introduced advertisement and restricting the number of transactions you can add per day. It is ridiculous to force a paid subscription for what is effectively just a calculator. I will use a different app or a spreadsheet going forward. Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Flagship feature of $30/year premium, receipt scanning, is garbage. Seems to only be trained one receipt layout and gets half the stuff wrong on mine, but fixing what it gets wrong is more work than just not scanning at all. The ability to edit scanned items has been ""planned"" since 2019. Overall poor UX and little to motivate such a high individual premium price. Apparently they also limit usage for free accounts, so that should tell you where their priorities are in how to get people to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Learn to hate your loved ones like you didn't realise you could."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to purchase premium plan by restricting entry per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three free transactions per day. You got to be joking ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to track expenses during trips and hangouts with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Woof talk about a way to absolutely remove yourself from the market. I've been using Splitwise for ~6 years. My roommate introduced me to it and it was so helpful we loved it. I introduced it to my friend groups and we all used it and loved it. Now they only let you input a few expenses a day, which you have to watch a 10 second ad for, and then you have to wait until your daily limit resets. I'm settling up my account and deleting the app. Absolutely horrible way to treat users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, the daily limit though is a complete joke and a deal breaker. Moving to another app unfortunately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This may just be my favorite app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless since introduction of 3 (?!) free entries per day. Very sad... they should implement some advertising to generate revenue in order to avoid losing the majority of its users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A Very useful tool to handle group expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update that limits free transactions is forcing me to search for a alternative application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has turned useless since last update. They added a 10s banner before you can add an expanse. Ok, that's fine since it's a free app. But they also added a daily limit on how much you can add on your expenses, so you need to wait a full day until this limit reset. You wanna push people on paying for your app? There are more smart ways into doing so, including a 1 time only buy (instead of a monthly signature) with better regional prices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. Now they blocked regular users with a paywall. Only 3 expenses per day? This got to be a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 seconds wait? 3 new expenses each day only? No thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor experience since last update. Remove the basic of things, making free tier useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app keeps on crashing for me... Each time i settle expenses the notifications does not reflect I the app.. ""Can't reach splitwise"" Keeps on flashing on the screen... I had to uninstall, download and relogin in the app twise till now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worthy after recent update, limit of 3 transactions per day in non-premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thank you for being there all these years Splitwise. I guess at some point, we all got to whoer out to survive in capitalism. Good luck with your venture. It's time for me to look for alternatives that allow me to add more than 3 expenses a day without a pay wall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty much useless/horrible now. Ads for Pro version every couple screens, and can't do more than 3 things per day. Definitely not worth $5.99/month for it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying $5 per month for the pro version. What a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Before adding any expense you need to wait 10 seconds if you didn't pay for premium. The app makes no sense in this version. Don't waste your time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another application making it difficult for the users to use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"£4.99 a month, are you having a laugh?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using Splitwise for years but now I can only add a few things a day unless I upgrade to a premium account, what a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dissapointed to see the daily trabsactio limit of 2-3 only. What us this behaviour Splitwise. I recommend considering adding a advertisement model to your money earning channel rather than just focus on being subscription based. You would retain your user base and they'll not shift to your competitors who have this and more for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible as there are too many paywalls. Disappointed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limiting the number of expenses a person can add is stupid af. i understand the ads cuz you need to make revenue somehow. but let me add more than 5 expenses a day ffs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for subscrption"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Una app que vengo usando desde 2016 aprox. Ahora tenes que suscribirte a pro para poder agregar más de 3 gastos por día. Una porquería! La desintalaré"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's really ridiculous to pay a premium , it's stopping to use after adding just 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont download! After 1 year within the app the developers want money for the simplest features, This behavior is unacceptable, ill just download splitzer or other apps avialable..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Updated 11/2023: Wow, free version is now basically unusable due to disruptive ads. Looking for an alternative app. Original: This app is great, but it's such a rip off that a basic feature like search is something you have to pay for in the pro version! C'mon Splitwise, make that free please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free version is becoming less and less usable day by day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The've been slowly destroying the app to the point to being completely useless as you can now only add 2-3 expenses per day. Moving to competition."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great great app but since it limited daily expenses only to 3! It's awful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and it was great. I even got my friends and family using it. They just limited the number of daily entries to 3 without even a warning to users. The daily limit doesn't even reset at the start of a new day. Definitely can't recommend this app any more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a great web + mobile app that I have been using for 10 years as a personal tool. They recently broke the free tier, I am leaving for another team that understand the difference between pro and personal consumers. I will return and amend my note if this is reversed back of course."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay wall unreasonable and removes features. Since it updated to have a expensive subscription at £5 per month I have decided to delete the app. It doesn't offer me £5 per month worth of benefits. I'll find another app that does similar things. Used to be 5 stars, now 0 stars. Greed has ruined it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"versao gratuita muito limitada"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Remove expense adding limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"RIP Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years and will delete it from my phone today. The developers have made the free tier completely useless with its three-expense-a-day limit and the entire experience obnoxious to use. Showing ads every time an expense is added is also incredibly intrusive and is something apps from 2011 would do, not modern apps in 2023. The fact that they're pushing their ""PRO"" tier as a subscription and not a one-time purchase is just rubbing salt into the wound."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting expenses when compared to before. The 10 secs delay is fine. The daily limit however is not(unless premium)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great app, but now they are trying to force users to buy premium version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Taking money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"RIDICULOUS..! Used to be really good app, and suddenly capped to only 3 expenses per day. Like seriously?? Stop forcing this BS subscription thing on users😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was 4 star on my review Of 23-09-2017. App is fantastic utility but they failed to monetize it. Initial attempt was to pay for additional features but recent revisions has made app trailware / pay-to-use. Still recommend if you're ready to pay or adjust editing existing expenses as still unlimited edits are allowed compared to only 3 new expenses free per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From Excellent to Bad in 2 moves. 10 sec delay is still acceptable since it's free. But 3 entries per day is just the limit. Im not going to pay RM200 per year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Recently introduced pro is very expensive. Though it has good features, just for tracking purpose it is not required. There should be some low cost model and a bit more attractive free plan. Otherwise the basic users will easily switch to other good apps with their basic tracking needs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the new 3 transaction a day update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent but the limited daily expenses has made it unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ask money after 3 transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I fully recommend this app specially those who live in hostel or flat with friends. Easy to maintain account and expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This started out as an amazing app esp for travel with friends. Unfortunately the recent changes to the app are disappointing - 10sec wait to enter expenses and only max 3 entries per day. Hope this app will be reverted to what it was before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Faltu"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As a user for five years I can understand the move of some features to paid plans and even daily limits for free users, but the removal of the quick add feature and lack of bulk updates via csv mean I can no longer use the app after five years to manage household expenses _______ Couldn't keep track of group spending until this app, fantastic!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new subscription campaign with the limitations is terrible, it's a reason for moving forward from this formerly great app to an other alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From best to worse"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I haven't even used the app today and it says that I've reached my daily allowance. It only let me continue if I switch to Pro. It's worse than having ads all over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to work great but the timers and expense limits is an awful monetisation strategy. I'm probably never using this again with so many alternatives available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be useful but the pro subscription has made me switch to old excel style."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly, I got a limit of expenses I can add per day and aggressive pop-up about the pri version. Honestly, it is very petty and low ... There are other apps providing the same for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but they now limit you to 3 expenses per day. Useless for trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro user for years. These idiots pulled a Netflix by restricting features on the latest update instead of adding new ones. The only way to survive is to make the freemium version so good that there is no other option, then hook in long term subscribers with the icing on top. Instead it's all stick and no carrot.. Another subscription service bites the dust."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I love this app, but the roll out of Pro is not okay. Being a free app going up to $40/year is sticker shock to the demographic that uses this app. I would have paid $1/month to remove EXTERNAL ads long ago, so the free version was still accessible to everyone and the company would have a revenue stream no matter what the user chose. I'm giving 3 stars cause it's a great app and the other options don't measure up but pro is not worth the money and I'll adjust to the new constraints."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version became useless. Why have free version at all when there is no benefit from it?! I very much dislike such business models. Also, happy to pay reasonable price for what the app used to provide, but this is far from reasonable for just writing down numbers with headers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, that I would happily do a one off purchase for if there was an option. Now they have added 10 second timers and limits to expenses input daily for the sake of forcing you onto a monthly subscription plan for a service that doesn't require servers or ongoing costs for them to run, and it's also not an exactly original idea that is hard to copy so there are plenty of alternatives. Really short sighted idea by the people running this app. Will just move elsewhere. Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'd pay once to use this, but not on a monthly service. The new screen that makes you wait to use the app makes me really hate the app developers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was awesome until they introduced 3 expenses per day limit. This should not be a premium feature! Ending the month and will look for another"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very dissapointed with the recent changes. I've been a user and advocate for years. The move to a high monthyl subscription charge is nto justifiable. If this was a one time purchase at a reasonable price I wouldnt have any issues. I'll be looking elsewhere for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the free subscription is so limited now, the app became useless. I will move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app. But now they are asking for bucks to add expense. Moving to group me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app.. but they forces to buy this product just for basic functionality too much money.. offer a free and paid version.. you want everyone to get paid version.. need to move to other app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is useless now. Don't know what is the new business model but you are going to lose all your customers if you don't bring back the basic features back to the free tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for a while now, recommended a lot of friends also but as soon as I updated it to the latest version. They now allow only 3 expenses per day for the free version. Nah man, I'm out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting expenses entries on the free app without warning. Makes the app basically useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rate limit of 3 expenses per day is making the app absolutely unusable. At least make it something reasonable like 20 per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 expenses a day per person. Everything this does can be done by a 5 year old on a spread sheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only use if you're ready to pay 30€/year for a calculator/note app... Ridiculous - the free option has been made useless. There is no reasonable ""buy once"" option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used for so long and now we have to pay. Get wrecked."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to find some substitute. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have just made this app unusable by lowering the number of expenses that can be added per day. Such a bad way to push customers to buy the pro version. Would look for alternates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You've just destroyed your own app. Shame on you for being greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Its the best app for managing group payment details which has many practical useful features. Just loves it. Only issue is that we can add max 2 entries per day for free user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was simple and good. The rate limit of 3 per day of adding expenses is just bogus. Will move to other competitors. I understand generating revenue is important, may be force use of splitwise pay or something, or may be 10$ for lifetime for such a simple app. 5$ pm is just greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This became the worst ever useless app after implementing the limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was all great and all my friends are using it until they limit the entries per day and force us to upgrade to pro. Will find other alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since they added a limit of daily expenses you can add on the free version, the app became useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As the basic version is absolutely useless after the upgrade please suggest some alternative to this app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great idea! Very good for group travel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sorry guys, you have a great app, but limiting free users to 2 - 3 transactions per day just makes the app unusable. I have used the app for almost 7 years, and of course, I understand the drive to increase revenue, but in this way, you will just kill your user base. I am installing tricount while writing this review. Cya"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free version is useless now. you can add only 3 transactions a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transactions a day... 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. But since they have added a premium subscription, it has become useless. Will be uninstalling it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update, it is just annoying to use the app. 1. Unnecessary ads after every expense put. 2. Limit to just 3-4 transactions per day (this just sounds the company is desperate to make some money) 3. Going to switch to other options as suggested by people like tricount, sesterce, etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since 2018 i use it but now limitation of added expense make me so sad, 😥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introducing limit for daily expenses.... I am done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fatal el cambio... Ahora si no pagas no puedes añadir más de X al día. No solo eso, para poder poner ni si quiera una, ya te hace esperar 10 segundos (y así cada vez hasta que llegas al límite diario)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greed for money by the developers have completely ruined the app. Acting like beggars and asking for money at each and every step."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but they messed it up with the recent changes. Will be looking for other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After update it becomes horrible...... Everything is paid. Developers need to make some changes asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be very useful but with the limitation of three transactions per day of otherwise paying monthly or yearly 40€ it became unusable. Switched to another free app with same features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After sometime use not work and they forced to start premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of entries on splitwise is troubling the users quite a bit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am leaving ASAP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just deleted my account, thanks for ruining the app by adding the ridiculous limitations 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Latest restrictions made me uninstall this app since it's no longer useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We have been using this app for years, and it has been fantastic. We are now encountering restrictions on adding expenses, which is quite frustrating. I have recommended this app to many friends, and we have all been actively using the free version. The recent push towards requiring a paid membership which is not good way to increase revenues. Splitwise should explore alternative methods for generating revenue, as this current approach may prompt existing customers to seek out alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a user for past 8 years. This new limit just throws everything down the drain. Back to other apps we go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"good function, but clashes too often. The crashes are really annoying. Clashes toooooo often！！！！！！！can't bear it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The limitations of free version are very annoying (wait 10s to register a new debit and limits by day)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ad is so annoying now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to enjoy using the app, but they changed which aspects are paid content making it a lot less useful for free users. Edit: they continue to restrict what non-premium users can do. The free version is now almost pointless for regular use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to like the app but they brought down the number of updates per day to 3. That's horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was fantastic until they decided put restrictive expense adding limits on. To convince people to move to pro. But pro has many many features I don't want or need so I don't want to pay for them. Too expensive for the way I want to use it. Offer a cheaper light option then maybe. But for now 1 star because of their aggressive and intrusive marketing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app... I used it to track expenses with my girlfriend but I don't put expenses every day. I register expenses all at once, this new dayly limit thing breaks the experience completely. I'm going back to excel using shared spreadsheets which was a good experience but it didn't have the pretty looks. If you want money just put adds or sell a paid version, a subscription based service for this kind of app doesn't work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The bills are not syncing with the server. It's annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Can only input 3 expenses per day in the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app - then they decided to move all basic functionality under a subscription model without so much as a heads up to their users, the app is useless now if you don't pay for it, and the lack of communication is yucky. Would've paid for the app if it was a one off, or even might have subscribed if this was handled better. But as things stand would not recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The removal of features in the free version, features that have been free for years until now, and putting them in the pro version is such a sleazy move. I understand the dev(s) need to get paid for their work but there must be a better way than pushing the overpriced subscription model, right?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense per day. You guys are just wanting to kill the app yourself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"too expensive for just an app just for spliting the bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Big mistake making it paid, wait time would still be ok but max cap on adding expenses makes the app useless, could have generated revenue with ads. There are lot of free alternatives dicoverable theough a google search, switching to those..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keeps bugging to but pro. Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing my review from 5 stars to 1. I understand you want to push people to pay for the pro features, but making the free version worse is very damaging to your brand."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"All of a sudden, free version just reduced to three transactions per day. This is more of a stick than a carrot Splitwise. If this sticks around and you keep pushing the paid version, your app has lost all value to me. There are plenty of alternatives and I'll happily find something more appealing. I'm certain I'm not the only one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You now have to pay to use. Not free. Too good to be true I guess..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is no longer free, didn't even communicate it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expensive limit :/"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version no longer usable due to daily limits. Unfortunate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable with the new daily limit of 3 expenses per day. The only way to remove the limit is to pay a monthly subscription with a steep price."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very cunning strategy for conversion to pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update that they've rolled out of capping daily expense limits has done it for me, 3 per day also without giving any prior notice to it's existing customer base is just poor consideration and decision making by management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is useless because a limit of three transactions per day has been introduced. I suggest to switch to competitors like Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic app, and one I'd even paid premium for a couple times. Forcing premium by limiting number of items which can be added and forcing a 10 sec add break seems underhanded and short-sighted. Will be looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just adding to the pack here so the score drops a bit more: this app was great until the update that limits input maximum 3 expenses a day. Will settle up and unistall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise has been a staple on my phone for years. I am always trying to get friends and family to use it -- and have sung its praises while doing so. Now it requires a monthly/annual subscription fee for the most basic of functions. It's truly diabolical how significantly they limit the free usage, it's legitimately unusable. They aren't even trying. If it was a one-time fee, I would pay it with minimal grumbling, it is a good app, but a subscription service is frankly absurd. Bye forever."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now you can only add a couple expenses per day so not useful anymore pay wall for the normal experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From an amazing app to a app with forcefully asking for money and so many restrictions causing it a bad publicity. The era of splitwise is gonna die, if there is no other app then I would go back to old school i.e. Excel sheet. One suggestion for developer, asking to watch some ads is good but forcing user to move to pro with 99₹ per month for which people get OTT to watch makes this app worthless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get it that products can't be free but 3 expenses a day? That's a bit to much. Maybe 10 or 20 might have been worked. Many great features are behind a paywall because of which users don't even know their power. If every account initially had a trial by default where they could try everything and then realise the amazingness of those features, more would subscribe I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed with the direction Splitwise is heading for their monetization strategy. If you're going to make the core feature of the app be only available for subscribers, make it a paid app to begin with."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads are still okay. But putting a limit to the number of expenses per day to 3??? Absolutely embarrassing from the developer's part for the latest update. I already see countless reviews addressing the same issue. If this is the way the team thinks they'll make more money, they're so wrong. Deleting the app after I type this. What a huge potential gone to waste. RIP to the actual Splitwise. 🙌🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awesome way to keep your user base, limit the daily inputs at TWO or buy our useless pro version. Yeah, I think not. Whoever came up with this genius marketing plan should be fired. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for ~10 years, but am going to abandon it now with the rate limit enforcement. That is an instant deal breaker for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update limits the amount of expenses you can add per day to three. There's an ad for splitwise pro that if you don't look closely, you would be under the impression that if you don't exit the ad quickly, you'll be forced to pay for pro. I would recommend choosing another cost splitting app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited number of expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined. Lifelong user. Management decided to destroy the functionality for money. Daily expense limit? Time to move on to other options. Just make a cloud spreadsheet and forget these clowns."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version used to be very useful app until recent update they forced you to watch ads on every expenses added, yet they limit the number of expenses you can add per day. Now it's just another useless app waiting to be uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of 3 transactions makes the app useless on the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is really bad to force users for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Well, I think I'm fine with the 3 expenses per day if it allowed that limit to rollover for a month. I don't add expenses everyday and this came as a surprise. Oh well, back to a shared Google sheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience limiting daily number of items that can be input into the budget to two per day. It is clear split wise wants people to purchase pro and to not use the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous limit on number of expenses you can add a day on the free version. If you want people to buy premium then actually add value instead of limiting the basic function of the app. Trash app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now a ridiculously low limit on number of expenses you can add, and the Pro version is very much unaffordable! Much better apps out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bakwas"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Woe splitwise good job getting a customer out of your service. Who's idea was it to limit transaction per day? What a terrible thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling the app due to its payment notification and ads, never expected this from this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App che era molto carina e ben fatta, purtroppo ora non è più utilizzabile proficuamente nella versione free a causa della creazione del limite giornaliero all'inserimento delle spese, la versione pro ha un costo assurdo. Disinstallo, pur con rammarico, a causa delle infelici scelte degli sviluppatori (secondo me lo capiranno presto a loro spese)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm using this since last 1.5 years and It will helping us to manage all our groups expenses. Because of this not any kind of confusion happening. App is really good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, now just plain cash grab trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I decided to update the app and was surprised to see most of the features missing. The subscription based model isn't great, but would have been ok if the price was lower. I don't travel enough to justify this expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nos fuimos un grupo de amigos a pasar una semana a Irlanda y nos salvó de hacer cuentas, casi da gusto pagar jaja. Ahora la uso en casa y a diario. Update: Tras años de uso me cambio a otra app porque el límite de anotar gastos diarios la hace inútil en la versión gratuita"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to switch to another app. Free version is restricted to 4 records per day. And that includes ads as well. The pro license is not worth the price tag."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is a game-changer for splitting bills effortlessly. Its intuitive design and real-time updates simplify group finances. Seamless payment integration and detailed reports make it a must-have for stress-free expense management. Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The basic feature to plan expenses without requiring to add user via inviting so that we can quickly see minimum transaction to do is missing. It will be useful when you want to quickly calculate expenses per person and who needs to pay who so you can quickly resolve it with cash without forced to feed info and add everyone, or when you just want to plan expenses for a trip to see what will be future payments, etc. Allow admin to feed expenses for each user w/o actually making each user join."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointing to see the paywall on the number of transactions per day. I understand the need for monetization but 3 transactions are way too less. I will be finding an alternative to splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was awesome before update.. but now it's just trash without subscription .. please remove daily limit or increase it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only 3 entries are allowed. are u kidding me. on a trip minimum 10-15 entries are required. RIP Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can add just 3 expenses a day and forcing customers to buy premium. Didn't expect this low from this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The paywall is ridiculous. I could maybe do with a one time payment for lifetime access, but I'm not adding another subscription to my expenses. Used this app for years, and I'm now looking at other options (of which there are plenty)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent expense limit is crazy. A one time payment would be fine, but a subscription model?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not free anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous pricing and expense limits. Defeats the purpose of the app altogether."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit is very unreasonable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now it limits the number of expenses per day and forces you to upgrade to the PRO version which is not free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage now that you have to pay to add more than 3 expenses a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit for adding expenses is ridiculous and makes the free version unusable. The paid version is unreasonably expensive on the other hand..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I wonder who pays to add expenses and calculate in an app? I was using this app for over a year, and now it feels useless. Instead of monthly charges, the app can earn through other ways like (ad revenue). Monthly charges are more expensive than a monthly mobile recharge!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro to Just to add expenses is annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The New ad to promote slitwise pro with writing time to pass is what i think about you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We are transitioning off to spreadsheets, because of the Clockwork Orange-esque marketing tactics they're implementing--for being forced to stare and waiting for a self-promotion of an overpriced product that acts like it doesn't already take enough with our raw financial data but now our time as well. I understand needing money but after 'spoiling' us with habits of easy access only to take it away - literally, Excel or Google Sheets gets the same job done for less annoyance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Establishing a daily expense limit for free users is understandable in theory but the number is too low. 3 transactions daily is not enough for any use case and I would recommend anyone looking to use this app for a trip / house splits to look elsewhere now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and had been using it for years. Now I hate it. The developers made the stupid decision to add a paywall by limiting daily transactions. I'd rather have ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible decision to restrict daily expenses to 3. Horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is the great app till now . But from the latest upgarde it got useless. Remove this ad for purchase otherwise it will get useless from now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be good until they add a daily limit, ads I understand but daily limit for expenses is 3 per day, so it just sucks now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be one of my favorite apps, now costs an absurd $5/month to use it at all, ruined"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses per day, not worth the download. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and will be uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage app now that they require you to pay if you need to put in more than 3 expenses for an insanely high fee. Worthless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was all good until you guys started to make every basic feature as premium exclusive only. Atleast the unlimited expenses feature should be a free option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Due to the paid version that too monthly subscription and for providing only a limited number of expense addition."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using from nearly 6 years now and had great experience. But recently the ads and making the app paid has let been letdown. I need to move to other app now. I dont understand why even such simple task needs an amount and that such a high price."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I find it hard to reset my password. Where's the ""forget my password"" option?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, now with a daily limit of..I don't know how much, i have to add expenses every day to overcome this , and it doesn't even state anywhere the amount of the limit! All to press you to get the pro version..no thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forces you to go Pro by limiting entries to 3 a day. Been using it for years and without any warning, they pull this stunt to their users. The Pro version is also ridiculously expensive for a glorified excel sheet. I've started using Splitser instead and urge everyone to use alternatives as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is no zero start..so I provide one start..even one start is not worth for it.. Per day it's allowed only 10 record..very very worst app..If you want pay money and use it.. There is so many free apps there.. Don't recommend it ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy and incredibly dumb move to suddenly limit expenses to 3 a day and force upgrade. Absolute pain to move all our house expenses to another app but I'd do that 10 times over rather than pay a cent for this bail and switch tactic. Way to tank a brand that relied on mass accessibility Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update is terrible. After using this app since 2016 I will no longer be using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Sadly they felt forced to add features to block you from using the app as before in order to get you to pay for it. I understand that developers need to earn money even with their free apps, but then there is not even a reasonable priced payment option and solely a subscription model (price around the same as Spotify Family/YouTube Premium Family). Lifetime payment option would be something I definitely would consider"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new update the free version is a pain to use. I have to find an alternative. Like this it's almost unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only one expenses can be added in the free tier now and they push you to pay for more than one expense. It's pointless using this app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nobody needs paid version. Uninstalling this for good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Aukat dikha di lagta Google dene band paise diye... uninstall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The Notes get disappeared when you revisit an expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the sudden, incredibly crude forcing to switch to Pro only set me on a path to find an app replacement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limit of 3 expenses a day with no warning after using the app for years? I get they need to make money, but just arbitrarily introducing it is really terrible customer service. will be moving app, would rather switch to pen and paper than give them money after this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous pricing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Even the basic features of the app are limited now under pro. Why do you even offer a free version?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been a long time user with splitwise. Instead of adding features to make it compelling to get pro, they've instead hamstrung their free app with a insultingly low limit of adding only 3 items a day and intentionally slowing it down."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding expenses is chargeable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started having a 3 entry limit per day to push people to pay for slitwide pro! Rip off!!! Boooooooooo we don't like them any more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was one of the most useful application, but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"LoL. $50/year or $5 per month for a bill splitting app is too much. You should either introduce ads or a one time payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have drastically reduced the daily transaction limit that it's unusable unless you upgrade to pro. As a long time and heavy user, Im really disappointed. I don't mind upgrading if I was given a heads up that this change was coming."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be an awesome app but now it's just useless without paying for the pro plan. They've just limited the free number of transactions to 3 a day. I'm going to look for a similar service but I definitely won't pay this so called pro plan for this service as it's not worth it. Also, I did not notice any previous email letting me know of any changes, I just tried to use the app normally and a sudden pay wall appeared."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I added just three expenses and can't add one more. Why I should be forced to buy a pro version? This is a daylight robbery!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app by introducing a limit on number expenses you can add per day for free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"why bait us all in then make it unusable with a secret update to ruin everything?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They released a pro version and messed up the free version to force people to upgrade. It was good before tho."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I loved splitwise until the recent ""update"" to limit users to 3 expenses per day. I'll be looking for free alternatives. I'd rather watch an ad than pay for this service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise Pro is very costly. Now I need to pay to split my bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the heck, Splitwise? You just broke the main feature of the app adding the ads and limits on expenses. We've been using this for years but I guess it's time to look elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed by the obvious cash grab described at length in other comments. Hopefully they will revert the latest changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Now it's become unusable unless you decide to be a paying customer. Just switched to SettleUp and it's looking like a good alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The day you throttled the user experience to near unusability for free users is the day I leave this app. Sadly it was very useful, but not worth 5€ monthly by a long shot. There are many other ways to do simple spreadsheet math. Congratulations on alienating a now former user. For what it's worth, I would've happily paid 5€ yearly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be the best, now they limit the amount of entries you can add in a day (to something very low like 4 or so) and make you wait 10 seconds before adding any entry. Unfortunately it's unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was an amazing app, have been using it for years to split costs of travels, with different currencies / groups etc, never an issue and I would have definitely recommended. Now they decided to set a daily limit of 3 entries, firstly letting you add one after waiting 10 seconds and then not at all until the next day.. unless you subscribe. It is an extremely sad and disappointing strategy. Pushing users to buy premium package."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limited transactions on free version is annoying"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every group of roommates use splitwise to track all expenses. But if you force us to take premium by adding ads and expenses limit then we are already looking for another free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 gastos he metido hoy. Al quinto, a pasar por caja. Poner un límite de gastos diarios tan ridículo es absurdo. La aplicación deja de ser gratuita y la única opción para poder usarla es pagar, dejando de tener sentido que haya una versión ""gratis"". Después de tantos años muy contento con Splitwise, este cambio os va a costar muchos usuarios."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removed feature to add pic of receipts and moved it pro version only for Android users but not for iPhone users which is silly. Was very useful for splitting expenses among roommates, but now looking for other options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's been said enough times but recent updates have killed the app. 3 expenses per day max???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. They got greedy and now it's virtually unusable unless you par for Pro Version. GTFO"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer allows unlimited expenses add, time to look for a replacement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a paywall unexpectedly. I'd pay a one time fee but not a subscription to use this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app until the latest update. Filled with ads and a daily limit of 3 expenses. If it keeps going on like this people are going to switch real soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was borderline annoying and unusable, but to a semi tolerable extent...now with the new policy, it's just not worth the battery it pulls. Im out...after 4 years. Byeeee....."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only do 3 expenses a day for the free version . App started forcing a monthly pro version in the last update. Will probably move to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app for free users. Only allows two expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are forcing paid subscription. I will be moving away to a different alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously good app destroyed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even add expenses now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Definitely it sucks after introducing the pro version. Added 4 nominal expenses today and it's showing I have reached today's limit, that too after having to watch a 10 second long ad. This is so not worth it. Cannot be the only one feeling like this because just saw the many 1 star recent reviews. I really hope they reverse this and I'll soon switch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As lots of other people have stated, this used to be a great app, but the recent introduction of limits etc have made this app unusable unless you pay. Would be ok with paying a one time fee, but a MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION? for bills? They grossly over-estimate the value of the service they provide. If I have to watch a 10 second ad to just enter a new transaction (which now have per-day limits), I may as well go back to tracking expenses on excel. Even doing it manually would be faster."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to really like the app but now with the daily limits its really useless. People only use it for trips so seems like a flawed business model to ask me to upgrade for a 3 day trip or to not be able to add my expenses on time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"free tier is trash now, can only put 1 expense a day. thank you for the past few years. bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst decision of capping the daily limits(only 3 times) per user. There is no need to cap the limits.. Asking to pay for the usage is really ridiculous.. I quit using this app. There are many more other apps who are providing free service.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app with daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now daily limit makes it useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling because of the daily limit. That's such a petty move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Okay...so this bad guy want his share from the split now and that's really a bad choice. I can find so many 1 star rating and know what they deserve it. Instead of adding some pro features to keep the accountability and sending personal suggestions over the calls and mails they are providing us features and asking for shares. What a mess...will definitely move to some other better app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using this app for 10 years, I think I have to part ways. Ads after every 2-3 expenses are fine. But limiting 3 expenses per day is ridiculous. I get they want to make money, but there's better ways to handle and deal with this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Super practical, especially if you have roomates or partners with a lot of shared expenses. HOWEVER after the most recent update the app has been absolute trash. Ful of ads, urges you to upgrade to the pro version and limits the expenses you can add daily. Absolutely horrid. We used to add our expenses in bulk, no you can only add around 3 expenses a day. This is an absolute deal breaker, will be switching to a more competent expenses app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use to be good but with latest update, limiting expenses to three per day is not at all practical. Waste application now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update rendered the application unusable unless you're willing to pay for the Pro version and use like only 10% of the features. If you're searching for the free app, please consider other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"capped expenses... can't use the app now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Totally over the top expensive for what it is. To track my and my gf expenses 120€ a year now. Greed is only good if you provide that value"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For the 10s unskippable ads before adding expenses and daily expenses add limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. Now you are asking money after writing only 2-3 expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 3 expenses without pro version. If the most essential basic app functionality is hidden behind the pro-version..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I can only add three expenses every day. Whoever decided to enforce this should be removed from any responsibility, ever."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Newly added feature of max 3 expenses per day are rendering this app without subscription useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transactions allowed and then asking for premium. Worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restricting to 3 transaction record per day, yall could have directly begged for money instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, new limits make it unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app added a limit of how many expenses you can add per day max 3 per day. This makes it a useless app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app on a daily basis for years. Now impossible to use due to pop up ads with timers and maximum amount of expenses per day unless you pay for a pro version. Uninstall right away and never coming back"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using it since long but the latest update pushes you to purchase pro as it only allows you to add 3 expenses a day without pro. So now I need to pay 1000 rs/year just to keep track of the money I'm owed by my friends 😂😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a 3 expenses per day paywall for a monthly subscription and a cheeky crab nudging you to subscribe is just clearly desperation from a developer that doesn't know how to bring value to users so that they would pay for the app. Nowhere in the description of the app do they even mention this limitation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only three transaction limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot add more then 4 changes a day and need subscription even for this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"May your company die forever and so will your employees."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You have to use your own calculator app if you have multiple items on a receipt and only need to split specific items and not the total. The fact that there is no calculator function for adding multiple items together before splitting is whack"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Compulsion on taking paid version is not acceptable. This new policy of splitwise has ruined it. The free version only allows daily 3 expenses to be added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years and it's great for managing tabs with friends and family. Before the recent update, you can add as many expenses as you want on the free plan. Now, you have to wait 10 seconds before you can add an expense and you're limited to only a handful of expenses that you can add a day. It was such a great app before their desperate monetisation strategy was implemented. Shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expensess"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why not be honest upfront and tell me how many expenses I can have in free version instead of wasting my time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is pretty much useless with limiting you with the 3 expenses daily limit. It's just easier to calculate it all by hand and Venmo people directly than doing it among a couple of days. If Venmo can be free to use, this app should be too!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's awesome apps before. Now, I only able to add few items a day provided pay for $4.99/m or $49.99/yr to use unlimited expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day is ludicrous. Was good till then"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense Limit on free version is going to drive people away."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once useful app made almost totally unusable by greed. They are now desperately trying to extort a subscription fee by limiting even basic features without paying a monthly fee. No one is going to pay $5 a month for a shared spreadsheet, you absolute clowns. If you don't currently use, don't start now. Avoid!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful practice by Splitwise. No warning at all about the new business model approach to limit # of expenses or delayed time to put in an expense. This is predatory and disrespectful. Will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed with the update limiting expenses to three per day and introducing ads with no warning. This was a disgusting capitalistic choice that is alienated most of your long term users. You're forcing us to leave your app or be forced into paying which leaves a really bad taste in the mouth. Thanks for making the free version useless, we will be looking for another app. As many others have said we would have been happy to pay a one time fee for this app if it was an option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly I can't upload as many expenses as I want for free anymore! What a bummer... got block after uploading 3 expenses today."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Does not show the same group in all devices of all members sometime"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to 3 expenses a day killed it for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trash app. Only two expense a day allowed and you will have to watch ads after your first expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app uses to be a great way to manage the household expenses with my roommate - until they introduced the pro version that limits the number of expenses you can input to THREE a day. I have a stack of expenses I've been sitting on I need to put in and now it wants me to go to the app every day for the next month to do 3 expenses? Yeah no. I'll find something else. This is BS. I'm so tired of companies removing previously free features and locking them behind a paid subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor decision to limit the amount of expenses per day. Im switching to another provider. Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing experience of 3 transactione per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a phenomenal way to map and share expenses with multiple users, but after 5 years of use and being a promotor if this app, I will be moving back to a shared spreadsheet that accomplished the same task after the introduction of a paywall for adding expenses. The ability to add expenses is not worth $4.99/ month AT ALL. The product manager who launched this should be fired. What an embarrassing miss."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is not free anymore, have to switch to some other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day, should look for alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses daily seriously? I'm happy to pay for pro. But charging the same amount of money as YouTube Premium, that is not justified."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great experience until they started limiting the maximum per day expenses to 3. That is stupid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would give zero stars if I could. The push for the pro version is ridiculous. Making users watch adds to add expenses and limiting the number of expenses they can add (this second one really gets me that most) had completely degraded my enjoyment of the app and its usability. The purpose of this app is keep track of group expenses (my roommates and I use it for everything) and it is now very difficult to do that. Like many others, I will be migrating to a new app as soon as possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Convenient but difficult to edit methods of payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"New update is trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic now. Nothing splitwise pro offered was worth it so instead of improving it, they're forcing users to essentially buy what was the free version for years. Get outta here. I'm done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dissappointed with the latest update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience even asking pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Split wise used to be one of my most used apps. They've recently forced you to pay for premium to allow the app to be useable. Without paying you can input two expenses a day. The cost of premium outweighs the convince of the app. Moving away from this app and would recommend new users not try"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cash-hungry devs, you are nasty and deserve my instant uninstall. You destroyed your own app, congrats. For the people who didn't know, this is app is pretty much useless now without a ~3 USD fee per month."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Congratulations on updating your app to distruction. Switching to a alternative asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is literally like extortion, only limiting to add 3 expenses per day and that too without any pre-warning. I think it's a high time shift to other alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are too many ads. Now, the app has plenty of users they are trying to get the users to pay for the pro version by putting too many ads, each with every time you put an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Charging Rs. 49 per month will make this app unuseful to users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update has brought some terrible changes to the app. Now I'm unable to add more than 3 expenses. It just ask for pro version. Even adding 3 expenses shows the most irrelevant add. Pro version is supposed to have added benefits and not limiting the existing one. Very terrible experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was one the best app. But making it mandatory to buy premium to add expenses is such a scam. Like this is the best way to ruin a great app. Pay to use the most basic feature of the app seriously ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, transaction limit makes the app unusable and the ads wait is unnecessarily annoying you guys don't even have ad sponsers to show in your ad break, switching to a better app now plenty of easy alternative available on the market"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now that they limit the amount of expenses to 3 a day its a pointless app. Why do I need to pay £3 a month for simple features that can be done in a spreadsheet? Absolute joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"earlier it was good... but it was just to lure customers. the daily limit reset is a CHEATING to the users... forcing them for buying Pro version for the basic things they offered. People will shift to other useful apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version of the app is now useless. Moving to an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only three expenses per day for free users? you expect us to pay you for addition subtraction division? wow"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was my go-to app to track split expenses for years. Now they have added a daily limit of adding expenses which is an absolute deal breaker. And the pro version is just too expensive. There are better alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is now useless due to daily transaction limitation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wastage I've been a loyal Splitwise user for a while, but recent updates have left me frustrated. The limitation of recording only three payments per day feels restrictive, and the push towards the Pro version is disappointing. I understand the need for monetization, but it seems like basic functionality is being compromised for those who choose not to upgrade. As a user, I value the simplicity and utility of Splitwise, and these changes have made the experience less enjoyable. Please reconsider"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits destroyed it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the update. It's miserable to work on this application. High time to shift to other applications for record of transactions. Daily transaction of 3 is terrible!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update, Asking for pro subscribe by default allowing 3 transaction per day.. There is no point of putting this app free if you restrict the user to use the basic function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Requires payment to do basic things like adding an expense. Extremely scummy move for honestly something that's so simple to create."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to be a really big fan of the app. Used it a lot! But I'm going to look for an alternative because you can't really use it anymore without having to pay... A real pitty."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's sad to see something so widely used be destroyed because someone decided to milk money out of a great free app. I mean I totally supported the 10 second delay to add expenses (seeing this was an awesome free app), but they destroyed everything they built by turning greedy and setting a limit to the number of expenses per day. I feel bad for the developers as 100% of the people I know are looking for alternatives as this is not something anyone would like to spend money on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years to track shared expenses with my husband, it's a nifty tool but nothing more. The recent push for the paid version leaves a terrible taste in my mouth. Suddenly there is a limit (and they don't communicate how many expenses you can file before hand) and the experience adding expenses is just terrible now. This tool is not worth €40 A YEAR. I can replicate the functions I need with a shared Microsoft List for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY??? new update makes it useless, doesn't let you add more than 3 expense daily? Starting to look for a new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ruined the experience by only allowing 3 entries per day. Makes me wait and watch an ad for splitwise pro before even making any expense. This is a horrible detraction of the user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Holds android users hostage unless they pay for premium, makes app functionally useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Era perfecta la aplicación, es increíble que hayan puesto un anuncio cada vez que quieres agregar un gasto. La volvieron inservible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst kind of ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was previously a fantastic app, however since they capped the number of expenses you may enter to 3 per day, not so much. Of course, I can pay £30 for the premium version, but then my partner likewise has to pay. And thats a subscription, not a one of cost. All so that we may enter more than 3 items per day (we have no use for any of the other features provided). Guess we will go back to manual calculations! To sum up, was a brilliant app before, now it's not really worth bothering with."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We were using Splitwise for years,but since today you can input only 3 expenses per day. The premium version is expensive and we didn't get any discount off for being loyal users. We will change to a different app unfortunately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly they impose a limit on the amount of transactions you can add per day (max 3). It renders their app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money to ADD EXPENSES??? Horrible update. The app has become useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is trash. Basically unsuable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Add expenses limited to 4 expenses. Usability comes down drastically if having multiple expense transactions daily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"OK you need to have a profitable business model, but you need users for that. You will now miss the chance to keep collecting of data from people's monthly financial behaviour. Well done. 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not gonna use this app anymore. Can't add expenses more than 3-4 expenses without upgrading to Pro. Sucks. Gotta find alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit how much you can insert per day? Are you serious"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"terrible practice of limiting free tier with 3 entries per day together with 10 seconds ads. This is beyond greedy. Everyone should uninstall to make a stance against this anti-consumer behavior"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update is terrible. Rate limiting to 3 transactions a day is ridiculous. Back to spreadsheets, I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was 5/5 until they decided to limit how many expenses you can add in a day to force you to buy the Pro version. This limitation basically makes the free version useless. Looking into other free solutions outside of this app is recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cant believe this once great app could become so greedy. I can understand if additional features would require additional payment, but forcing users to pay just to use the core function of the app (splitting bills) is downright repulsive levels of greed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most third class app...pushing people to buy the pro is so selfish and money mongering greedy app company"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money after updating"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad move, basic feature is blocked. Who will pay for this? We can simply calculate ourselves instead of using your automated calculater."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They keep stripping features and making it worse if you don't buy the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Super useful app, but as many others said, it's £4/month, otherwise you won't be able to add more than 2 expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"was usable till free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to take pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After several years of using splitwise I am uninstalling the app. 3 expenses per day per user is unacceptable unless their strategy is to become a PRO-only app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app from 2019 and was a good app until you asked for a pro version in the recent update. What's the use of the app, if the user can only record 3 transactions, a day!! Totally disappointed, I might move out to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the new update, split wise is the worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everything is chargable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro version is the worst decision management can make for these simple apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pretty good app to maintain all the account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"pathetic, app allows people to remove themselves from any transaction & then doesn't allow expense adder to re add the person who left the transaction. People are doing fraud due to this feature. only expense adder should have access to edit any transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the latest update you can add only 3 transactions per day unless you update to pro version. Gonna find a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible.. No use.. Ony 3 expense can be included"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years, which has been fantastic for helping me organise finances amongst friends and family for our house and on trips. However the latest update allows you to only make 3 separate expenses per day, meaning that we, as groups of friends and family, cannot organise our finances at the end of every week as we have more than 3 expenses per day. Splitwise have made a terrible choice making the limit so low. We will all be moving to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't download, they'll screw you over with adverts and a daily expense limit, will be forced to buy the pro version. So disappointed as I've been using it for ages but they've destroyed it with this stupid move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Inconsistent limitations on Android compared to ios"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable now with 10 second ads before adding any expense. Change to another app, don't be forced into paying for this garbage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and restricted free usage ruined this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app from 4 years. Now after the new updation, only 3 entries per day is allowed. Disappointed and looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 or 4 transactions per day are allowed now. Time to move on to another alternative. I have used the pro version in the past. And, it's not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You guys where the go-to app for any expense tracking, bill sharing, anything related to money. With this new update and limitations brought it, you guys gonna loose the customer market and usage. There are bunch of other apps which are available on the market. Data sharing or data usage whatever, the ease of use which your app provided is not gonna be anymore. It should have been atleast 5 transactions per day to begin with your new updates, 3 was so bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app, but now it's useless. I have been using it for many years, but recently they added a daily limit of expenses that you can insert in the app. So it's basically useless now. Who wants to pay a monthly fee to just track the bills?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting the number of expenses that can be added to only 3 per day is disappointing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Downloaded but then immediately deleted once I saw all the comments about them deleting the free version. No need for another simple app getting greedy rather than helping people organize."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging 500 per year if we add more than 2 expenses per day. PPL please suggest an alternative app, split logic is so simple anyone can develop a simpler app like this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic functionality hidden behind a $10 paywall. App is pretty much useless to the basic user, not sure who made this decision, but it sounds like it came from an out of touch c-suite member who thinks this will rake in the money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new add expense limit is the worst. You can only add 2 expense per day. You have to get pro or wait for next day to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was great until they decided to lock everything behind a paywall. I could add 3 expenses before it said I was done for the day. I'm happy to support developers by *buying* their software but I can no longer deal with every application that I use wanting to charge me an ongoing service fee for the rest of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Ruined by aggressive subscription paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest updates enforcing a 10 second wait and a 3-per-day limit on expenses for free users have unfortunately seen Splitwise follow so many other apps into enshittification :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app, until they started going above and beyond and giving pro adds and making it super inconvenient for users to use it. I think setting a limit on the expense that can be entered is extremely unnecessary. Unistalling this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was blindsided today when trying to add my expenses into Splitwise by a 10 second ad/ timer to add the expense, and then I found out I reached my daily limit (after adding only one item). I used to recommend this app to friends, and now I will actively dissuade people from using it, not that I will need to once people find out the subscription cost to get more than 3 entries a day without ads. I will be finding an alternative or using Excel."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is no longer useful. Recent changes limiting the amount of transactions per day you can submit makes this unusable when a simple spreadsheet can do everything this does for free. I would gladly pay a reasonable one-time fee for this product but now I will never come back and tell my friends not to bother."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but they are basically forcing you to get premium now which is $5/month or 50/yr! I could consider a lifetime subscription or a smaller fee, but that's way too much for what this app offers. It's now basically unusable without premium. You have to wait 10 seconds between each expense, and you can only post 3 expenses per day. I used to recommend this app to everyone. I made a google sheet instead and we'll just add our expenses to that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting to just 3 inputs per day...... Worst than ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Having to pay to be able to add more than 3 transaction a day is the most stupid thing ive ever seen. I have been using this app for 7 years and this new feature just made me delete the app. I will be moving either for Splittr or Settle up. Your loss."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Review bombing as the recent change to 3 expenses per day after watching a 10 second ad each time is ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, but after introducing three transactions limit per day on free tier, it's completely useless. Pro version is absurdly expensive. Don't waste your time on this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"40 dollars to add unlimited expenses? Is that really necessary? And I need to wait 5 seconds to add expenses? Just spoiling the experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app....it is.i tried so many apps but this is so gud for sharing between friends and relatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Updates have made the app useless. Limiting expenses per day (especially to such a small quantity) makes it impossible to use properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, pay to use, delete"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grabbing scam now after update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but almost everything is behind a paywall now. I will uninstall today and switch to a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It used to be great, but now I can't add more than three expenses per day without buying the pro version. And that doesn't make sense since I only use it occasionally. Switched to a free app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient, and saves tons of time when sharing experiences with friends, or travelling with a big group or just one friend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App was working well but I'm extremely irritated that now, in the middle of a trip, I've been suddenly downgraded to be only able to add 2 expenses per day. Zero warning was given regarding this change and I'll be deleting the app asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now you are only allowed to add 3 entries per day. In order to add those 3 entries you will have to watch 2 ads too. I will be finding a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have app. Big thumbs up 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using this app for ages and it was perfect until the arbitrarily added a daily expenses limit of 3 per day to charge users for the pro version instead. Use other options instead, I've started using beam it, splittr and Venmo again, would love to use Splitwise again if they moved to a different monetisation method, their current method is horrendous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Plots kun je maar 3 uitgaven meer registreren per dag zonder over te schakelen naar een veel te duur ""splitwise pro"" plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update makes u wait 10secs for adding an expensen with that u can add max of 3 expenses per day! There are other ways of monetising the app. The pricing is to expensive in terms of value addition and it's replicability. They could have monetized through normal ads rather than restricting usage. Have to look for a better alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day, soon they are going to face lot of decline in users. Looking for an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update limiting the free version to just 3 expenses per day is totally uncalled for. Irritating the users by limiting the very basic functionality of the app is a horrible move to promote pro version subscriptions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1. App asks for sensitive info (friend contacts), which I don't wanted to give to the application in the testing process. 2. When you should remove the friend, you should remove all payments from group and then remove friend and add payments again. 3. The app cares about your money. There are limited number of activities which you can done with payments (adding, removing) in a day in the free version. 4. Haven't tested the case - can I add a friend to the group with existing payments... :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite app for sharing monthly expenses but to be limited to 3 transactions a day is insane. And not even an offer to try pro for 2 weeks for free or anything to see if it's even worth the price. I'll likely switch to a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money grubbing devs trying to make people pay for basic functions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update can't able to record more than 3 transactions per day and for each transaction have to wait for the ad to complete. Such a pathetic service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for to use pro after three expenses! Need to switch to other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Setting a daily transaction limit so people can pay is just cheap. Rather get a feature that actually requires payment. Y'all have lost the very basic fundamentals of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utter bs that you are limited to adding 3 entries per day. For an app which is this basic, you guys are way too greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a very good app to split expenses between group. Now its not free anymore. Who pays $3.99/month just to track expenses. Tons of free alternatives. Bye bye splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have effectively eliminated the free version. Limiting the free version to 3 expenses a day has made it unusable!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now they added a paywall with thr latest update which renders the free version absolutely useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used for many years now they just want money..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 entries a day. Really? Used to be such a good app but not anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app heavily until the ""daily limit"" of about 3 expenses started hitting, without prior warning. This app is cool but not cool enough that I can't replace all of its key features with a Google sheet with a simple sumif function so very much NOT worth paying for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for years and it used to be awesome. Now they've put a daily limit on how many expenses you can add making it unusable without upgrading to Pro. I understand paying for things but $60 per year for something that does math for you if rediculous. Guess I'll go back to Google Sheets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I love using the app until yesterday and today when I open it, I had to watch a 10 second ad and the worst part is I cannot add more than three expenses per day. It isn't right to force people who don't need the pro features to upgrade just for the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, a great way to easily split expenses between a group. Now with the daily expense limit, it's effectively rendered useless. Not worth paying for pro, I'm looking for a different app, or just making a spreadsheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but with 2 expenes daily limit for the feee version it's basically useless. There are other apps out there that do a similar thing and if not I'll go back to the good old spreadsheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app but they decided to make the experience worse by wasting my time because I don't have pro. Just show me banner ads instead of making me wait to add an expense?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app but they have just begun restricting the amount of expenses you can add daily without paying for pro. Hugely disappointed by this money grabbing strategy. Do better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until they've added the daily limit. The pro version is not worth the money as the charts and other pro features cannot be taken seriously."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be a very good app, but now is limited to a certain amount of expenses added per day. Of course if you pay a lot, you can get unlimited, and even then still do the job, but there are better apps for free out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a waste of time and money! Never use, simple expense tracking app asks for 1000 rs yearly or 150rs monthly...dissappointing...Happily moving to walnut which is free... splitwize was good until app became greedy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used Splitwise for years and loved it, but no way in hell am I paying $5/month or $40/year. I would happily pay a one time fee of $5-20, but I'm not subscribing indefinitely for a glorified spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable on free tier after changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely greedy move by splitwise to limit to 3 expenses per day and add a 10sec advertisement before each expense. Finally a competition for YouTube in anti-consumer practice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of 3 itself is low. Yet even without adding it appears over"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now after the November update. You can add only 3 expenses per day and that's it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Quite unusable now with the limited number of expenses which can be added each day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The transaction limit for the free account has rendered this app useless to me. Used this all the time to track house expenses with my roomate and trips with my friends/family. Now I can only do 3 transactions a day!? I can keep track on my own at that rate as I'll have to keep receipts etc. far too long to make it worth using. See ya later splitwise ✌️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit sucks. I'd just use other alternatives out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing users to have only 3 transactions a day further taking a pro... That's not fair in the least"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Even entering expense has become a paid option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app and was a big fan until recently! The new restrictions and app usage are crazy ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a 5 star app that became 1 by ruining the free tier of the app by limiting number of expenses per day to 3 and wants to charge 5 euros per month for more. Ridiculous when there's other free alternatives. Goodbye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits and fully advertisements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a limit of expenses you can add per day simply made the free version of the app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro for an expense split app, with such basic features? That too, not for enterprise solution..but rather a minimalistic expense division basic solution? You guys have gone nuts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have started asking for money once you take premium, even for a month. I think you must have one time fee for software. I am disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day? No thanks. Ill find another app. Shame cos Ive used this one for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Confusing UI, can only enter 3 expenses a day. Very bad!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day for free is way too low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The newest addition of not being able to add an unlimited amount of expenses per day is absolutely disgusting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless since update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With three expenses per day this is now a functionally useless app. Some workarounds: For a group of three people you can try to calculate totals in a spreadsheet, and enter those three totals as expenses. Note that if you mess up and delete an expense, that still counts as an expense and you thus only get two that day. All of Splitwise functionality can be accomplished in Libre Office Calc, Google Sheets, Excel, or other spreadsheet software."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible for the devs to not only remove functionality (expenses are now limited to 3 a day) but also not communicate it to users at all. I will no longer be using this app as I'm not going to pay for pro to get something I already had for free. This completely kills the app for me because I need to add multiple expenses a day, especially when my friends and I take trips. Goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The expense entry limit and the intrusive ads to make the user pay and take the pro version with a high cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise just became like the airlines, where instead of adding value they are taking value away from what used to be included for years, where after using the free tier for years they are now trying to push you to Pro tier by limiting the amount of transactions you can enter per day to 3. The only thing they pushed me to is the Tricount app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless since they started restricting daily expense limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restricting the maximum number of expenses to just 3 per day for the free version is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now that the free splitwise only allows 3 expenses per day, the app is basically useless.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be quite useful. Now you need to pay to add more than 3 transactions a day. Free version is now useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Giving one star due to the new rate limit on adding expenses for free tier, which was rolled out without any notification to end users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once great app ruined by atrocious paywall pricing and making free version unusable despite ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A daily, unreasonable limit to block basic functionality, along with a paywall with intentional hiding of information (nowhere on pro does it mention that that's what you have to sign up for to put basic expenses), is pure folly from your team. My first review on the app store, and I enthusiastically wish to tell you that I'm leaving this app, and will move atleast 250 users away from it. Judging by the other recent reviews, this is your inevitable crash and burn. Thank you for the years, bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years and it was great. Recent update with daily expense limit of 3 is causing me to switch to other apps for bill splitting. Bye Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One star so that they listen. App was great. Roomies, friends, and I were happy. I recommended this app to everyone. But paying for adding more than 3 expenses?! $40 a year is just overpriced. I was fine with other features being moved to pro. But this is too much. I really only need the ability to add expenses, which I'd be willing to pay for a reasonable price🙃. Starting my look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise for a while, but as a result of the recent update it is now impossible to use. we can only put in single digits of expenses so we can't possibly cover everything unless we buy premium. Free version is completely pointless now and I'm going to find a better app or switch to an Excel sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now I have to wait 10 secs every time I want to add an expense? No thanks. I'll uninstall and find a better alternative soon. It was an amazing app until this. I'm not going to be forced to pay an expensive subscription in this way. Bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since they added the 10 sec waiting time and now a daily limit the app is useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Simple and plain. Latest easter egg is bunnies. pro too costly. Update November 2023. 3 expense limit is too less. 5-7 per day should be allowed for free. They can also have a lite plan in which I pay 100 Rs per year and I get 100 expenses per day limit. I don't need other pro features to pay 500Rs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless as daily limit for adding expenses is so low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Chiedono 30 euro l'anno per 4 conti e 1 bit di spazio online? Stiamo proprio esagerado. Peccato"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 entries per day for the free tier makes this unusable. Time to uninstall and search for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App works well, but setting the limit to 3 expenses per day is absurd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love the app and use it frequently for many things, but since no longer being able to add more than 3 (just three!!) expenses per day now Splitwise is totally useless, and I will be looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new limit of 3 expenses per day for free tier made the up useless for me and my friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poor , now you have reduced the Add expense to 2 times a day. Enforcing user to pay or leave the app I would prefer Excel or any other app rather paying for Pro Basic functionality limited, no use the application anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such desperation to get users to pay for the basic functionality since the recent updates!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined it! Other 1 star reviews sum it up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disgusting! Daily limit is very low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Until the latest update it was a 5*"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dumme neue Regelung"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are charging midway of an expensive, refusing to proceed or conclude my expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing pro version by showing 10s add for every expense is ridiculous, to me pro version adds no value. Will export my expenses and start tracking them elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad promotional strategies for pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only you can add 2-3 expense per day. Outrageous. Uninstalled it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Removed and unsubscribed . Used to be a good app with a specific purpose (keep track of expenses). With all the limitations now, is not fit for purpose anymore. How can users be expected to pay a 'premium' to add more expenses ? I easily found a great and completely free alternative. Heavily suggest to rethink your approach for the basic features (adding expenses) these should never be touched."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's a 3 entry limit per day. Can't get any bills done now that there's a softlock"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day? If you don't want to have a free tier, just say so. This is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"free version of app becoming unusable. premium version far too expensive to consider"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good, but free version is useless. I was using a free version of the splitwise app so far, and it sufficed for sharing flat expenses with my flatmates. But lately they have restricted the max. number of expenses added to the app down to 2-3 daily. I used to add all the week expenses (10-15) at once. They also stopped allowing uploading photos of bills some 6 months ago. Now I either need to subscribe to paid version (costs more than Netflix subscription) or move to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous policy change. Paying more than 5 euros a month to track your expenses? I'll be using another app as long as this policy is kept."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Do you really think anyone will use the app if you put a limit on the expenses anyone can add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't bother with this app. It used to be good but developer has become excessively greedy and it is not useful unless you pay for the full version. I will be utilising a different app from now on which doesn't remove features from users unexpectedly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily Limit on expenses is so much of headache. I mean what's the use of this then? If it ain't get better Iam switching to other apps atleast they are worth the headache"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit of 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can hardly use this anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works perfectly fine but you have to WAIT OR PAY to post more than 3 expenses per day. Shame!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keeping Only 3 free transaction limit per day is a very bad move by Splitwise. It's time to find new Apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limit of only 3? Really? I'd really like to know what you guys were on before pushing out this new ""feature""."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's a great app but recently they have limited the number of expenses one can add in a day to 3-4.. which is very inconvenient. We have to find another app soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is like Forcing Customer to use Splitwise Pro We can not add Expence for 24 hour while Creat new group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of the best apps in its genre, not anymore. I won't be surprised if a Wikileak or whistle blower comes out stating Splitwise has been selling the abundant info on their customer base & unaltered spending habits of world population to its highest bidder!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but recently went downhill: nag screen for adding transactions, limit of 3 transactions per day. Severely overpriced subscription only with ""working"" version. Absence of improvements lately, just monetization. Looking for a replacement app that would be able to import Splitwise data."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yesterday I was able to add as many expenses as I liked, any time I liked, instantly. This morning I have to pay $5 a month if I want more than 3 and if I don't want to wait before posting. There was no warning that this change was coming. We're already locked in, with years of data, so moving isn't going to be easy, but believe me, I'm going to put in the effort. Update: Well, that wasn't hard at all! Good luck splitwise OK byeeeeeeeeeee"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stopped using after the 3 splitwise entries on the free version was implemented. I can understand trying to push users to the pro version but honestly Venmo is free and has the same feature. Will be utilizing that from now on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 2 times without pro app.. just sucks now.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Um lixo, era de graça e sem aviso nenhum passou a ser pago, agora é buscar alternativa pois esse app morreu..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was useful until the latest updates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and since they changed the app to a limited number of expenses per day makes this app useless. Especially if you are splitting a bill by item per person. This app went from something I recomended for trips to the most frustrating experience over night. Already found another app. Will not use again since the new limitations have been put in place. Way to alienate your users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but useless with the 10 second waiting time for adding a new expense and daily expense limit (3?). Would not recommend it anymore.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 2 expenses a day because I ""reached the limit"". Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Being using the app for a few years but now I'm migration to an alternative because of the limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 seconds of advertising per entry"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Main features are behind paywall & ads now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using the app for years, I love the app. Fast, reliable, well designed. I have commented multiple times with friends that I would love to contribute to the app by buying it. Think about this, I don't pay in commissions 40€/year to my bank maintenance. I would be willing to buy the app for 40€, but never rent it for the same value. Ended up never contributing anything. I used the app with my wife and today we decide to switch to a concurrent app, due to the new restrict. Will keep 5*"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Since the newest update, I am planning to uninstall it and go with a competitor. I really don't like when such greedy changes are made, and users don't even get a better service"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but the new freemium model with artificial punishments like a 10s wait to add stuff is just not ok. I'm looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you can only add 3 expenses per day now on the free version, might as well make it 0. greedy owners"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app, but now it's useless. I have been using it for many years, but recently they just pushed people away. First, they added a 10seconds waiting time before adding any expenses.. Okay, annoying, but fair enough, it's free. Then, they added a daily limit of expenses that you can insert in the app. So it's basically useless now. Who wants to pay a monthly fee to just track the bills?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced subscriptions after using it for years. I am willing to pay one time fee or nominal yearly fee but $5/month is way too high for the offered functionality. Search for alternative apps is begun and ready to move out once and for all. Also, it reached daily limits after 2 manual transactions and one recurring transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has been great, but recently they started asking for payment. Now, I'm searching for an alternative and plan to uninstall soon once I find one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For only basic functions, I don't know what kind of fool would pay for this pro. It's lacking some functions anyway. Goodbye 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update only allows 3 expenses to be added per day for free. Went from being a good and useful tool to yet another service price gouging itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After introducing the three expenses per day limit, this application became useless for my needs and I'm not willing to pay the premium for such a basic functionality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable without pro. Choose another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is bad. Splitwise devs decided to cut costs and the free version only allows you to log 2 expenses daily. Did you went to 2 supermarkets? sorry, you can't log anymore today. Is 1st of the month and you need to log electricity, rent, and phone? sorry, it's a no no. What's the price of pro you ask? a 40usd per year PER USER or 5usd if you want to pay by month. I'll remove my data today"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Going to uninstall after the recent updates👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You cannot push previously free features behind a paywall and expect people to upgrade to the premium app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 transaction in a day and dorcing people to upgrade to pro version. Better to switch to new apps which have same functlionality for this basic functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, have used for years and recommend to others, but to add my voice to the others, the recent update is a lowball, brute force attempt to annoy users into paying money. Badly done guys, very disappointing and sad to have to find something new."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update to cap thre and expenses a day on the free version has ruined this app. I wonder who made such a decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent limitations to the free version make it barely usable. It used to be a good one before getting greedy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using splitwise for over 10 years but the recent limit on adding expenses (3 per day) for the free version has made me decided to look for alternative apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I understood that you want to make money out of this app, but your strategy is very worst. You either provide a unlimited splits with normal ads using which you can earn funds or let user buy pro version. But restricting for 3 splits per day with useless crab ad is very awful. There'll be hell lot of users who simply switch to other apps. A frustrated Android developer like me can also develop a fully free app too. Change your strategy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added an ad delay and expense entry limits. What was once a simple and functional app is now trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best app regarding budgeting and trips with friends. It's now pretty much required to pay for the pro version, otherwise you can only add 3 expenses per day, which is incredible low for ANY kind of trip. And these changes happened with 0 prior notice, kust overnight. I strongly suggest to find an alternative app, which needless to say, won't be hard."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Regrettable business model decision from Splitwise makes it impossible to use the app anymore. My household was relaying on Splitwise to log expenses but now we switched to a google spreadsheet. The worst part is that the new changes only apply to Android users! My partner doesn't get the ads and input limit on their iPhone. Splitwise, revert your changes and rethink your approach, you are killing your product!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For adding expenses now its showing limit. We need to find alternative app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Split by itemised bill isn't available on the app. Just use this on the web browser version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As most other reviewers have stated, this app used to be fantastic until the latest updates. Entries capped at three per day, and you have to wait for the ""ad"" to load before you can add an entry. My partner and I use this all the time, and it was amazing to track expenses while overseas using different currencies. I just can't justify paying the exorbitant subscription price. Will reconsider if it is a reasonable one-off payment. I will start researching other apps available."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic version is absolutely gutted, not usable anymore unless very infrequently. That's not the issue tho, the problem is that the pro version is waaay too expensive. Its as expensive as Spotify in my country, and there's no option for a one time purchase which is reasonably priced. Hopefully they will revert some of the changes or change the pay structure, otherwise they will lose most of their userbase."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit of 3 transaction per day is too harsh. It's simply useless for me to use this app as travel expenses tracker now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In the app's latest releases, they are trying to force users to purchase the Ad-Free edition by putting in place a max number of expenses per day which I will not do. Will certainly switch right away to another better available app instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limits on daily expenses and awful countdown timer have made me give up on this app after years of use. There's no way I'm upgrading to Pro - uninstalling now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The current version of the app feels restricted compared to its previous functionality, and there's a noticeable emphasis on encouraging users to opt for the premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a useful free version since you need pro version to add more than three (3!!) expenses per day. For me, that means no no. Bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are limiting the max number of expenses to 3 per da, therefore I am saying bye bye splitwise! (there are so many free alternative apps)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I agree with everyone else. Why change features for your long standing users to now limit how many expenses you can enter, and now can't enter photos, etc. Poor form. You'll have a lot of people delete this app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was working fine until they decided that you have to wait 10 seconds before inputting every expense to make you pay a monthly fee... Will be finding another free option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yikes. Recent update to force ppl to pay will probably be the beginning of the downfall. No way I'm going to pay just to add transactions. Time to look for alternatives. Good bye splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be a really great app for managing the expense for my friends' group until the latest update on the end of October. I know about the business model to earn some revenue from the apps but not this model. The idea of expense limt only for 3 expenses for FREE users is totally rubbish and will ruin the ""used to be great app."" I don't want to use the other premium features, and Pro subscription isn't reasonable for me. What's about one-time purchase for the ""previous"" basic funct?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since they made adding pictures a premium feature, the app became useless to me and many of my friends with whom I used it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is currently unusable in its free form. The form that made it so popular over all this time. An alternative structure for free vs pro needs to be found"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free tier is unusable now. They've removed too many features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They crippled the app trying to get subscriptions - I'll just find a replacement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for, perfect for keeping track of and categorizing shared (and personal) expenses and who owes what. Free version has all the basics and most important stuff one might need without annoying ads so I can't express how much I love that. Only suggestion I could make is to potentially add more custom options for organizing/categorizing expenses (maybe custom categories/photos) but that's not really a vital addition by any means. (Unsure if paid version covers this)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic monetization attempt. A freemium product is supposed to work decently without payments, it's recent paywall just made me angrily switch to tricount and come write this review"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app for YEARS without any issues. Suddenly and without any notice or communication I've been capped at 3 entries per day limit. Oh but if I pay for pro at $5/ month or $50/year I can go back to using it for a dozen or so entries I need per month. No incentive to pay when we're literally spoiled for choice for similar free and functional apps. The only way they were going to get people to pay was to roll this out and catch everyone off guard who were in the middle of a running balance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience since they started pushing for pro, now you can't even add more than 5-6 expenses a day, they will ask you to buy pro to add more expenses, so will be uninstalling the app, and will continue to share expenses with group the age old way which we did for so long before smartphones and splitwise. Whoever thought this is a good idea, you are really stupid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for many years but the last update is simply ridiculous: introducing a daily limit of 3 expenses and a 10 second delay for adding a new expense in the non-pro version. The pro version is very expensive in my opinion if you're just interested in the basic features. I'd rather have ads and the option to pay once for an ads-free version. Time to look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro is crazy expensive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A perfect example of a money grab killing a product"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This uses to be a pilar in my group expense management but now is completely useless. I understand the importance of monetization but 10 sec ads before each entry and a 4 expenses entry limit is just killing it... its a really really bad model. I could accept something like a 10 or 15 entry limit and ads, for a free to use scenario but forcing users to pay 5,99 a month for this is just nonsense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Probably useless. You'd have to wait 24 hrs to list 3 expenses? Way to make your app s#itty kudos to you guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This new update only allows you to enter 3 transactions a day before you hit the limit. You either have to pay a monthly fee to enter more than 3 or you have to wait till the next day. Plus, for each of the 3 free transactions, they make you wait 10 seconds in order to be allowed to enter a trans. Absolutely garbage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limits in the free version make it useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The CEO of splitwise deserves an award, brilliant decision to force subscription by ruining the experience. If I don't subscribe, it is because I don't see any value. You are not the only one on this space, I will just change apps and keep on having a free subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable ever since they implemented a transaction limit, and now it's more ads than content. I've been recommending splitwise for years and now regret it. Immediately uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most recent update rendered this app useless with a limit to 3 transactions a day. Instead of adding features to make premium worth paying for, they just pressure free users. That might be a valid strategy if they actually improved the premium features or lowered the price but it's never been worth the money. I'll be switching to any of the dozens of alternatives. Pretty annoying especially without any warning. That aggressive behavior just shows how the company operates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Apparently they've added a limit of expenses you can add daily if you use it for free. Also you have to wait 10 seconds before adding expenses. Some sort of A B testing they have going on. If you haven't used this app yet, find a different one because i bet this will become a regular thing which honestly sucks. The subscription is also really expensive. Let us just pay one time for the app and get on with it. Really a bummer!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To get money they limited the number of expenses I can add daily that's so bad. Really bad experience what that update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"since they included ads the app is practically useless. time to look for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 second waiting time and limited number of expenses...? From HERO to ZERO real quick! 📉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. Been using this app for a while now and was about to shift to the pro version then came across a daily expense limit that they recently introduced. It let's me input just 3 expenses a day! The fact that made their free experience so terrible just to shift people to the paid version is not the way to go if you want to build good will. Quite a terrible decision on the teams part. I can get behind a limit of 20 or 30, but 3!?!? That's unacceptable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was good until they started a limit for entries. Useless app right now, going to switch to an alternative app that does not require any charges."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless at the moment. They begging for money for each transaction. If not subscribed, they put a limit for the day and won't allow to put any more transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for premium for nothing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A masterclass on how to lose all your users with just one simple move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've used the splitwise app for a long time with friends, roomates and my partner. However, they've recently restricted the free version a lot - including enforced wait times to add expenses and low daily limits (4 expenses/day). Although I've faithfully used splitwise for about 5 years, this is now annoying enough that I'll be looking elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking money after new update..time for another good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is very bad for free tier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expense entries in a day on free version. Who will use? Bye bye 👋"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Very helpful if you are willing to shell out $40 for a membership. After adding 4 expenses it stopped me for the day.... Not using it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What kind of product experience is it if a person can only log 3 transactions in a day. Uninstalled right away."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads? Really? To make use buy a 40$/year subcription? Wow that's a low, remove that scummy feature please. Don't forget your app is only a glorified spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to pay to skip waiting for 10 seconds for adding a split??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It pathetic that after years of usage, the maximum number of expenses were limited for free version and it's forcing me to buy pro version. Shame guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I cannot pay for this app and with recent update there are too many limitations, I am looking for an alternative now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Better to look for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a loyal user of the app for years but the recent decision to rate limit free users to 3 expenses a day has made it absolutely impossible to use this app and hence will be uninstalling it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"L'applicazione di per sé è utile e comoda, peccato che tale comodità non compensi il dover pagare un abbonamento mensile per fare qualcosa che ognuno potrebbe fare gratuitamente con un minimo di sforzo in più; pessima, dunque, la scelta degli sviluppatori di rendere a pagamento il servizio. Io ed il gruppo di amici che utilizzavamo l'app per i nostri viaggi la disinstallaremo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful, I recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best app for expenses, now the worst. Wants you to pay $40 a year to add more than 3 expenses per day. Greed at it's finest."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst update ever with ads and a limitation to add only 3 expense a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be an amazing budget tracker among friends and family. Having a timer between adding or even showing some ads would be understandable, but having a daily cap of just 4 expenses is ridiculous. Just create a Google Form with all the same fields and you can even get Splitwise Pro functions virtually free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have started to make you wait 10 second to watch an ad whenever you add an expense now. Better off to go with a different app where you don't need to watch an ad to track your expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Long time user, I used Splitwise to track my house expenses for years, but the newest update just make the app impossible to use. I understand pushing for the pro upgrade, but limiting to 3 the expenses that can be added daily makes the app pointless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version now useless. Used it for years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit on expenses adding. That's insane"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, without any big issues. Now I can only add 3 expenses per day unless I upgrade to 'splitwise pro'? No thanks. Removing the app and getting an alternative. They will lose all their users this way, too bad. 🤷‍♀️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Understandable about ads. But only 3 transactions per day? For real?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app. If they offered a reasonable price for the pro version, I would be happy to pay. I understand that it costs money to develop, but it's not as is there has been any real improvements in features to justify the pricing for each of us"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App got greedy. Gave us free and switched to some wicked premium all of a sudden without any new feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fantastic app, but now they make you pay for a subscription if you want to add more than 2 expenses in a group....that's ridiculous given the core function of the app is for expenses to be added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm made to wait 10 seconds before adding an expense every time with a very low daily expense limit. This doesn't happent to everyone, they're probably doing some AB testing, but if it happens to one person in your group it becomes super annoying. Time to try out tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As many have said the latest update has severely limited the functionality of this app for free users and the price they ask for a yearly membership is exhorbiant. Hopefully the developer's realise what they've done and restore free users functionality, lower subscription cost or bring in a one time purchase option. My suggestion: just create a Google sheet instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app since long during trips, to share expenses with others. It used to be very useful. However, in the latest revision, they have put restrictions on number of entries in a day. This defeats main purpose of using this app. Pepole like me who use the app only during trips, can't go for purchasing the subscription. Splitwise may consider restricting number of active groups, instead of restricting number of expenses entries, to make it suitable for users like me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been a long time user and occasionally subscribed to premium when I went on trips and needed to handle group expenses. I was okay using the app and all my friends use it too. However, now they imposed a limit of transactions and increased the price of premium. I will definitely look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used it for years until the recent changes where you have to watch a 10 sec ad each time an expense is added. There's also a limit of 5 expenses per day only without a Pro subscription. Doesn't seem to be worth the hassle to use anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop wirh this premium nonsense. App is useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is horrible. Money grab move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was perfect for years. Now out of the blue, I can't add more than 3 expenses a day unless you upgrade to pro. This throws a wrench in how we manage our household bills, so I will start searching for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One of the worst decision. You could just use 5 second ad instead of limiting three transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Another long term staple takes a fall. The pro tier push and rate limiting users to 3 transactions a day is ridiculous. I would understand limiting features by tier, but this is just crazy. I use splitwise like twice a year maybe to enter all my transactions at once. Does your product team even do customer interviews to understand how people are using the product before blindly implementing a new pricing structure to appease your investors? Hope the user churn will be a lesson enough for your PM"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No point in keeping a free version of the app if you're not gonna allow basic functionalities. The latest update sucks. They are basically forcing us to upgrade to pro by limiting us to only 3 (sometimes even 1 or 2) transactions a day. I'm going to look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this for 5 years, amazing app. Rendered completely useless with the 3 expenses limit, so will be deleting and finding a new option!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"5€ im Monat oder Zwangswartezeit für eine simple App - ist das euer Ernst?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just like many others already pointed out. Daily transactions limit and ads make this app useless. What used to be a great app once isn't any useful anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best and most preferred app for managing and tracking expenses, but not anymore. With the latest update, they're pushing the users towards the pro version, rendering the free version pretty much useless, with the constant ads and daily limit imposed on it. Will definitely look for a better alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can only add 3 transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App became useless overnight by adding rate limits and ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads for Splitwise Pro and now daily limits? You're not the only app on the block. I'm switching until this nonsense is taken off."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app used to be awesome. I use it to split childcare expenses with my ex-husband and everyday expenses with my current partner. I was irritated when they took away receipt scanning but dealt with it. Now they are limited the number of expenses (to like 3 expenses a day) that I can add? Just dumb. That's the main feature of the app. Finishing this review and hopping into the google play store to find a replacement app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update makes the free version basically useless. You are now limited to 3 expenses per day and have to wait 10 seconds between each expense. Very disappointed!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage since they added a limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not at all acceptable. you are charging even for two people,we are going for alternative apps....Your pro charges are soo expensive.Bye bye split wise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They put a timeout between expenses and a limit to the number of expenses that can be added. What a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a good app untill they made a nonskipable 10 second advertising for every operation that you make."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am not willing to pay, will seek for alternatives or excel sheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update made it worse ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have pro-subscription. It lacks auto expenses pick up from SMS which is sometimes frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't perform basic activities on the app after the latest update. Can't add expenses unless you buy the pro version. Highly disappointing. Time to uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit on day 1 of using this app low, now receiving annoying requests to sign up with the paid version. Deleting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Yeah, nothing good lasts forever they say. Now we can only add 3 expenses a day if not a Pro user, I don't even have the option to see an Ad to add an extra expense. No other choice than to move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They just want to sell you premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How to destroy a perfectly good app 101. Create a adwall for every single thing you do on the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"enshitification has reached even this small corner of the web... the new 10s popup ad for pro when trying to adding an expense is NOT the way to get me to pay for premium, good and relevant features would be..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Compulsory paid model very bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now charging 40 quid for basic functionality so uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent restrictions are quite unfriendly. I'm okay with ads, so need that option. Should have been intimated earlier so I could have switched to other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Aggressive removal of features aimed to force users to upgrade"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was just a great experience overall. But the developers have become greedy it seems. All the basic functionality is now behind a paywall and the app is basically useless for us."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update.. they are asking to update to splitwise pro..else only 5 entries / day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You really want us to finally uninstall the app. Add before every expense addition and 4 expense limit per day. We have alot of groups in the app but it seems like its time to uninstall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"RIP to another once great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update asking for money & annoying ads too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent change only allows 3 transactions a day, with timers for two of them. Went from the best money splitting app to the worst."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization went too far with the 10 second wait for each expense, only being able to do 3 a day. I will be looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed from 5 to 1 stars. Unnecessary ads spoiling the experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is what happens when you have the best app for something- someone decides to monetize it into the ground. If they wanted $5 or even $10 from me, they'd have it and I'd keep using the app. But to actually use the app with normal features, it's $40 a year forever. I'm sorry, but who thinks a glorified spreadsheet is worth hundreds of dollars over an app lifespan to use? It's almost cheaper for my friends to just not pay me back than bother with this junk now. RIP Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand it's a free app, but limiting daily usage, putting ads and asking a yearly subscription for the Pro version of unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Crazy helpful with roommates and friends or any type of bill-splitting. Really handy app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit on the number of expenses unless you give them money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 sec Ad to add every single expense. NO THANK YOU. This was the final nail in the coffin. Goodbye, splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be great now has a tiny limit per day for a monthly sub for an app you occasionally use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The $5/month paid option is ridiculous. I honestly wouldn't mind paying a one time charge. Also the 3 transactions per day limit makes the app completely unusable. Will uninstall soon once I find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Application just implemented a transaction limit of 3 per day for the free tier. This is brutal as they are asking for $5 a month now for their premium tier. If it was $1.00 I would pay it, but $5 is wild. Bye Bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adds and limited use in free version. Why would you do this? xD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Best app in the market for splitting bills. Not anymore after the new paywall!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used the SplitWise app for more than 2 years continuously but the time has come to finally delete it. Never imagined such cheap greedy forceful marketing they would do. Now every expense you try to add they show you a 10 sec promotion of their pro version. Okay, if you can tolerate it still they will show the true colors... You can't add more than 3 expenses in 24hrs. Woww! And those 3 expenses too at the cost of 30 sec ad watch. If you have extra money go download it otherwise not."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for many years. With the latest rate limiting update this app became unusable for the most basic features. You should not have to pay for this. Find a better way to circumvent your bot problem, for the meantime I'll go with Tricount as I have no other choice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app until this filthy cash grab was added! 5 dollars a month?! For a bill splitting app? I would happily pay a 1 time fee to buy the pro version, but I'm not paying a subscription for such a simple app. Terrible decision on the developers part. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good luck with the paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too expensive!!!! 'Think its just one coffee a month' do you know how many coffees i would be buying a month if i subscribed to everything??? This app is becoming a joke seriously ised to love it, recomended to so many people. Why cant you just add adverts on top or bottom of the screen or 1 off payment?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just use and experience..... Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even add more than 2 expenses now it ask for splitwise pro 😡😡😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app since 5years , but not it's asking to go for pro .. i am not able to upload a single thing now 😡😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't enter more than a three expenses a day. Useless for people who add expenses on a set day or for large households."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be 5 stars, but the newest updates to force everyone to upgrade made it useless, so me and my crew have migrated to another app. Its a shame too after using it for so many years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an absolutely great app, now there's a daily limit on transactions. Cringe 😬. Just use their competition."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limitations are very disappointing. I would have been fine with seeing ads but the price is too high for what it offers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are money crazy. I love this app many years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, turned into a cash grab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update, they just want money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update is frustrating and unnecessary."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't able to add expense after update, always shows reached daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It will be awesome, If we can add a dummy member for more clear distribution, It needed sometimes when one member id paying on behalf of two of them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great way to track expenses with my housemates. You could add pictures of receipts and add all your expenses whenever, but now they forcing users to pay for the pro version to continue to use the same features. Can't add photos now and apparently there's a ""daily expense limit"" so you are capped on the number of items. Extremely upset that rather than adding new feature to entice users to upgrade they are taking away features so if you want to use them still you have to pay upgrade"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I haven't used this app in years and now I come back to find that you can only enter 3 expenses per day??? uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With their new pay scheme they have rendered this app useless. It's $5/mo for a glorified spreadsheet. If you use this for any day to day things you will hit the new daily limit super fast... And then you are forced to pay or wait a day. Useless trash and I'm telling all my friends to delete it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense per day? It's bad bad bad now if you're using the free version. It reasonable at all!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Use la app por varios años hasta que pusieron pagos por añadir gastos, me cobran mensual solo por llevar un tracking de los gastos! Desinstalada desde ya."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So everything needs payment now. Why would i need to pay for updating expenses. Will certainly look for alternative now!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but the sudden aggressive monetisation makes it almost useless. Forcing arbitrary wait times and absurdly low daily limits to push an expensive subscription results in a frustrating and impractical experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I understand apps need to make money. I don't mind paying a one time fee for a service like splitwise or watching ads. But putting a 3 expense cap per day and forcing a monthly subscription? No."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Here's an idea, lads: how about promoting your Pro service (with useful features or promos) instead of forcing people to sit through an unskippable 10 sec ad everytime you want to add an expense? Guess what, I will NEVER give you money with that kind of business model. Goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless with the new policy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth downloading for free, you're limited to 3 expenses per day and have to wait between each expense. The features you get by paying are not worth paying for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added daily spend limits. Pro is way too expensive. Avoid"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app has been great for years. Now there's a limit on how many expenses you can add in a day? Are you trying to lose users? Most ppl update things in bulk, not after every expense. Guess I'll go back to sharing spreadsheets with ppl, or find another app. Just really disappointed and frustrated. I was in the middle of updating several groups and now I have to waste time doing it another way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am changing the app, now it is useless without premium versions, bye, you lost many of your users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version has been limited to only 3 expenses per day, without any notification. Well done for the strategy, you just ruined a great app and made lot of users angry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update limits number of expenses to be added to 3! Also forces you to wait 10 secs after you want to add a new expense, all in the hopes you buy a pricy subscription. No thanks, I'll look for a new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No point paying 999 a year for this. Time to switch to another app guys"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"experience became horrible after recent update where you cant add more then 3 expense a day. time to move to new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Blocking me from adding an expense saying im out of daily expenses before ive even added any from that day. Free version of this app is absolutely unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit is 3 per day for free tier. This is a joke. The company is basically killing off free tier. There was no mention of it in the website or any blog."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Alternatives incoming."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not letting me add expense even after splitwise pro purchase..though payment is done splitwise pro does nit get activated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Switching to other alternative free services. Thanks for all the memories, Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for travelling with friends...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best thing when travelling in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses for a day??? Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"limited add expenses, daily limit should be increased"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"strict daily limits of three entries per day have been enforced in the past week. if you need any more, you're forced to buy the PRO version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Very costly and they are reducing free usage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Surprise! Now you can't enter more than three transactions a day unless you fork our for premium. Thanks for the good years Splitwise - going to an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"An expense tracker app, that lets you record group expenses after you pay them. A scam is what this app has become! Now you can just record 4 expenses a day (that too after watching ads), untill you pay them. Used to be me and my friends' go to app. But no more, all of us are removing this app! Like Spotify, they are strong-arming their customers to pay!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Three expenses can be posted a day?! Are you serious?! Have been using the app for almost 10 years now and there was absolutely no communication on this change!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unistalling the app due to ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite app but with the recent update which requires you to wait for 10 secs to input an expense and limits you to 3 expenses per day makes the app almost unusable unless you subscribe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since its become premium with such a high cost, switching to other apps. End of an Era. All of us moving out of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version now limits the amount of expense we can input daily. This maybe to force users to pay the premium. What a cash hog you are, shame on you. You could have just sticked to just playing ads instead of limiting the expense. Users are now looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Been a user for many years. The app used to be great. Now it's useless unless you pay monthly for the pro version. Our entire friend group will be switching to a new app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app had all the great features but they pretty much put all their features behind a paywall and the app became useless if you don't pay. I wouldn't mind paying for pro features but putting all their core features behind a paywall is a silly move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is for the daily expense limit. It has just killed this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"10 seconds cool down for each payment is lame. Looking for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Aggressive data collection practices. Wants DOB, ADDRESS and SSN info to get paid, would not use it again!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The three expense a day limit is absurd! Makes this app nearly useless -- I enter in all of my expenses at the end of a trip and not as they happen. I'm going to switch to a spreadsheet or a competitor."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have to buy pro to add multiple expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Like others described, this app has been amazing for years. Now there is no reason to use it, following limits to daily entries. I'd be happy to pay a one off unlock fee for some extra features, which would support the app. However forcing paid subscription through limits of usage is not the way to do it. Will be looking for another app to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowed to add 3 transactions per day, useless now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Editing my 5 star review. Now 1 star, if 0 were possible then 0. Unusable without paying. And much better apps on the Play Store."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add a three expenses per day now, unless you want to pay $40 for pro, not just once, but every year! The app went from being great to being useless overnight. I'm happy to pay some amount of money but this app is absolutely it worth the absurd amount of money they are trying to charge for it. I switched to Sesterce which works just as well and costs $5 for lifetime license!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately the daily capping of expenses in the free version of this app, no longer makes splitwise convenient to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 transactions per day? Really? There's no point using this app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's paid and you don't even inform user in advance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not them restricted adding transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ads and limits are terribly annoying and it's very expensive for what it is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a daily limit without notice, only 2 expenses per day, use anything else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are now forcing us to buy Subscription. Really dissapointed by the latest update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limiting free tier users to 3 transactions a day is a sure shot way to kill your own product. Good job splitwise, your limitations makes me want to delete the app more than pay for premium! 🖕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What a frustrating thing to pay for, you cant add more than 3 expenses in a day. What a waste of time feature to earn money of."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"its asking me to pay or wait till tomorrow even for a basic entry of an expense, also the amount is too high for me to proceed, hope we will get a better app than this... which has basic features free to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall makes it useless. Will be uninstalling soon, pretty sure monzo does the same thing for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic way to get subscriptions in the latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The ridiculous move to a enforced subscription. Once you reach a 4 entry per day limit means we'll be moving to a new app. It's a shame as I'd happily have paid a more reasonable fee, but they aren't even adding features before this. All they're doing is hiding basics behind the paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bakwas app, don't install, bhut Sara time. Or dimag khraab Krna pdta hai members add kro unke no, unki mail, itni der me too khud hisab ke loge, completely waist of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used the app for a while but the arbitrary limit before a 10 second wait to add another expense is truly irritating in the recent update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update has absolutely ruined the experience for me. It is allowing only 3 expenses to be added per day. What's the point of the app then? Premium features can stay behind a paywall, but removing the most basic usage for which people download this app is bs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a good app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is a classic example of overcapitalization. This is a simple app. It does not need to do a lot, it does not need to innovate a lot. But they wanted MONEY! I don't know who would need a ""Pro"" version of this. But they did it, and now they are damaging the experience of the free users to push the pro version. I have always liked Splitwise over the competition and have been using it for years, but this is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app became useless after the limit to allow adding only 3 transactions in a day for non-pro users. First they added an ad after adding each transaction and now this limit. Searching for an alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was good till they decided to force people to buy the pro version. The limit daily expenses feature is ridiculous. There are tons of alternative free apps, and I can do the same function on an excel sheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is garbage, limiting how many expenses you can add in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limits since last update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love Splitwise and recommend it. Now with the enforced advert (annoying but understandable) and the daily expenses limit, it makes the app pointless. What's worse is they didn't bother to tell anyone. I will be looking for an alternative and recommending that to friends instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using split wise for years with no problems. I went to add expenses for the month and it turns out I have a limit of only 3 expenses I can enter a day. This renders is unusable for my half dozen monthly expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to use this app daily with my partner for expenses, now moving away from Splitwise due to daily limit of 3 expenses. Not good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even after upgrading to pro plus , Balances and split between group members are not showing correctly.Please check and try to resolve it ASAP."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Updating my review as they are forcing users to upgrade by making you wait 10s before adding an expense and limiting 3 expense/day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now there's a daily expense limit? Come on. And that's already after making you watch ads to add expenses. Split wise pro for $5 a month? Forget it. I would pay $1 per month AT MOST to keep this app functioning as before. I understand there are operational expenses but this app is a glorifed spreadsheet with a fancy UX."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"🙏🙏🙏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise, without communication, began to limit free accounts to only 3 transactions per day. When asked why, they made up a lie about it being to combat bots. The lack of notice and poor responses suggests that this app is going downhill. Won't hang around to find out what other surprises they have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Advertisements after adding 3 expenses per day is frustrating. Been using split wise from many days. Time to switch for a better app if this adds continue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free limit of 3 transactions per day is way too low"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Genuinely makes group trips way less of a hassle."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited expenses in a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitwise are missing a trick with their current business model. People do not tend to go on enough holidays per year to justify Splitwise Pro, but would gladly buy it for a specific group. Please add the ability to make a single group support the Pro features for a single fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using it for 9 years, but it has recently been made useless by an absurdly low limit of entries you can add per day. Time to move on to the next app and watch splitwise implode."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the recent updates, splitwise has rendered itself useless for normal use. I understand it pushing users to buy its pro version, but limiting only 3 transactions a day its too much...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pretty much useless after the update, there is a 10-second wait to add one expense, and a limit of 3 expenses a day. Just get another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"bakwas"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update that limits it's users to only 3 transactions a day is horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not free anymore. Now you only have 4 free transactions per day (2 of which have a 10 second timer before you can input them) basically forcing you to buy the Pro subscription. Looks like I'll have to look for an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day limit is a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you want us to pay for adding transactions, create a low pay tier. I don't need other features provided by pro version and it is very expensive for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid app do not install"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This attempt to monetize is really pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What even is the new update supposed to mean, I mean at this point just shut down your app :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years but recently introduced 5$ monthly fee for a basic use is ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling splitwise now installing ""settle up"" free app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money is really annyoing. It used to be a great app but not now. I am looking for alternative. Please let me know if there is any good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only get 3 transactions per day on the free version??? Makes the app unusable unless you pay for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The sudden limit of 3 free transactions is extremely disruptive to long time users. I understand that you are free to charge how much ever you want, but users are free to transition to other apps as well. I just would have appreciated a 2-month warning, so i could plan my transition. I am so dependent on splitwise, that it feels like extortion to have to pay for 2 months just so i could leave the app gracefully. Such a shame! You guys were doing so well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Updates make it unusable. Users can only add 3 expenses a day. This change was made with no notice or notification. I'm moving to a competitor and don't recommend using this app. Hopefully this move to try to force everyone to pay for the expensive pro version backfires on them..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"NEED TO BUY PRO FOR WHAT IT IS MEANT TO DO"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app, need to pay to add more than 5 txns a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, now you can only enter three expenses, after that you get a paywall to buy the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is basically unusable now that it has a 10-second wait every time you add an expense and a limit of three expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Such a nonsense app. 3 expenses a day? Are you joking. 10 sec ads? Are you kidding me. Uninstalling this nonsense, there are much better free alternatives out there. Gotta pat their monetisation team on the back for their stupidity. You can't annoy me into paying for basic things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Been using this app for years and noticed recently the subscription paywall appearing much more frequently. But limiting adding daily expenses to three? Big mistake. I'm sure like me, users are going to find another app now. Congrats on alienating your user base!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update ruined it, switching to different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"As with everyone else the most recent update killed the app, I will be switching to a different finance tracking app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used it for 8 years, and now never again - they just started charging for the ability to add more than 3 items to a list each day. I went over to Splid, much better and completely free, no adds."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad change to introduce 10 second timer for adding each transactions and limiting to 3 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for a while to split monthly expenses and always loved the app, however splitwise just implemented a tiny limitation on the # daily expenses input (3/day) which made the app useless and very inconvenient to use. Hoping they roll back this update anytime soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for splitting expenses, has lots of options and variety to split them in any way you want. Very recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise have recently made a (in my opinion very greedy and disgusting) change, limiting the amount of transactions PER day to 3. This means that unless I'm able to log every single expense, every single day and hope I don't do more than 3 transactions a day, I'm now no longer able to log payments. I've been using this app for a while now without issues and so it's really disappointing to see Splitwise resort to trying to milk its users out of money. This has nothing to do with bots or spam."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was the best app for roommates and couples to keep a log of expenses, until they added expense limits!? what the hell! and you have to wait between expenses to add them? looks like someone has gotten greedy that instead of providing actual premium features, they're relying on cheap tactics to earn more money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The last update completely ruined it, you have to watch ads before adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit completely destroys the free version of the app. Will seek out competitor apps to use going forwards for the basic expense tracking functionality"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for years, now they have implemented a ridiculous daily limit of only 2 transactions, making it pretty much useless. Time to look for a new expense splitting app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit on adding expenses is very harsh I think, only 3 expenses per day. The app has become unusable now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing ads is okay.. limiting adding expense I'd useless.. who will pay for this .. it's time to look for alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was alright before the 3-transaction limit. Refuse to be extorted for $5 a month for this app to remain functional. The team probably assumes that users are more-or-less locked in but my entire friend group has collectively decided to abandon this app because of the changes, so cya 🫡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was excellent in the past, but recently, they implemented a strict expense limit (only 3 per day??) and introduced timers for adding expenses for non-pro users. Why not consider incorporating ads instead? I recommend exploring alternative options as I cannot endorse its current state."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Becomes useless after new update it asks for premium after 3 transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app..we used it for a group hike and it worked like a charm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be great, but now you are limited to a number of expenses per day and on top of that you have to watch and as every time. I would understand having to watch the ad, but on top of that limiting the number of expenses is just ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but now; Daily expense limit? 10 seconds delay? Bye bye!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New daily limit ruins the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't seem moral to make your app from free to paid without any intimation to the user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update only 3 free expenses in one day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After latest update asking for premium..Also cannot record more entries.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I dont like this app. It creates havoc between friends. It calculates without any update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for pro purchase after adding 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money after adding 3 expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely unusable since the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why the hell suddenly we have to wait 10 seconds to add every expense. I don't want to pay, fly away!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but after the last update they're basically forcing us to buy their pro version. Showing unnecessary ads, limiting users to add upto 3 transactions per day. So you mean if I'm out with my friends, I can't split the share without a pro membership as obviously there are gonna be more than 3 transactions. They're just getting greedy and I think it's time to look for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Since the last update you even have to pay for adding expenses. Everything is over a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Last update limited the free expense additions to 3 per day to push pro subscriptions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I totally liked Splitwise. It was easy to use and great to split the bills among friends. Dark theme was also good. 5/5."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why bring something called pro version which allows only 4 entries per day after ads?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love that app, but they succumbed to capitalism. Now they make you wait 10 second delay before you can add an expense and there is a daily expense limit, unless you pay for premium. I'm fine with adds but this is unforgivable. Moving to another app and never going back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless, only able to add 3 records"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app worked seamlessly in the past and the simplified mode was genius. Now not only free users have to wait 10 seconds everytime we want to add expenses, the limit is also 3 exprenses per day, which is absurd. No option to buy the app once, another subscription for life. Will not use this app for long."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be great but now they have introduced a limit to how much expenses you can add in a day which used to be free beforehand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update made a mess of splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was great until they introduced a daily limit of 3 transactions that can be recorded for non pro users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent change in expense limit makes the free version unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily expense limit to force me buy the pro version is ridiculous. This is my motive to go back to tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best apps for expense management, but after the update, I am forced to buy a premium if I want to add more than 3 expenses a day, which makes this app useless for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for Money for basics function."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My experience with the app has been nothing but positive until today. The latest update has made it impossible for me to use. I am forced to transition to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work as intended. Cant use it anymore. Every time I login, the screen freezes on the home screen. I can see my groups and all the other buttons, but clicking does nothing. App is updated. If I re-install, will it erase everything? Such a hassle. We shouldn't have relied on Splitwise. Big mistake."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a friendly apps for ""free"" users as 3 expenses can be only added per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After update, you can't add more than 3 expense per day, you have to buy subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using it for years, but now is unusable with the limited daily posts and the timer. Will switch to a free app offering a similar solution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update is sick! The daily entry for the transactions is 3 per day, that's horrible!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version became almost unusable. Whoever came up with the idea to wait 10 seconds between each expense and put a limit of 3 expenses per day is going to get exactly what's coming for them when the app gets lower ratings. People will just go to other app, this new addition is a blatant attempt to force you into buying a pro by making all the previous functions unusable on free. Not coming up with cool new features for pro, not lowering the price on it. Genius. Bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With new policy of putting a limit on adding expense and making it compulsory to buy pro plans, it has drastically degraded the user experience. Highly disappointing. This is a very useful app, but the new change or update is not helpful at all. I wouldn't mind paying one time fee of say ₹500 but the current costs are too expensive. Hope you come back with revised model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are multiple ways to make money using the app. Many companies are following as well. I am not able to understand who and why suggested splitwise to force people to buy subscription only for adding expenses. There are many other apps which are giving free expense tracker. Limitation of 3 expenses per day will definitely hit the usage of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This haa been my go to app to split expenses for years and I can still work with Ads but limiting the use to only 3 free transaction per day is a deal breaker"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now it's time to uninstall goodbye...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but with the recent changes of limitation to the number of entries and the 10 seconds adv; more people is going to switch out of the app. Moving to another competitor app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"taking photos is now a pro feature. this used to be free. i rarely used it and just noticed a few days ago. ""Various fixes and improvements"" in the changelog translate into the app is getting worse and removing features that were free. probably switching to another app next opportunity I get. edit. from 3 to 1 star. sometimes have to watch an ad for 10 seconds to add an expense. nope."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update is really bad, constant ads and delays. A limit on the free account. Super disappointed with how this has turned out and the push to get people to their pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"What a step back after the recent update. The app used to be amazing, but now there is a limit on the number of expenses you can upload daily + you have to wait 10 secs for an ad to upload any expense in the free version. Otherwise, you would need to pay 4eu/ month or 40eu/year for the premium version. When every service changes to subscription like this, coupled with increasing living cost, consumers just have enough!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your time with this app, try SettleUp, Tab, or Splid instead. Splitwise recently set a limit of adding only 3 expenses per day, and added unskippable 10 second ads for every expense submitted - all without notifying it's users of incoming changes. Splitwise is making a painfully obvious attempt to force the people who rely on its services into their overpriced subscription model and their cavalier ""profits first"" attitude will cause their users to change platforms. Good riddance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Begging for money just for wanting to add more than three expenses a day? Ridiculous. I will we using tricount until this changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A great app gutted by corporate greed. I've been using Splitwise for years and now I'm forced to look at 10 seconds ads for even the most basic of functionality. Moreover, I can now only add 3 transactions per day, making the app absolutely useless for its intended use: trips. All these changes were rolled out quietly without warning users. Like many recent reviewers, I will be moving to a different app loudly, hoping that other people won't support these awful predatory practices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using Splitwise for years, and out of nowhere this week they have imposed a 3-expenses-per-day entry limit on the free tier. No attempt to communicate this change ahead of time. Just a forced 10-second ad to tell you to upgrade to pro ($5/mo) or #$&@ off until tomorrow. They claim it is to protect against bot activity... huh?? I understand they're a business but they could have gone about this in so many better ways, and this is what they chose. So infuriating and disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the latest update they added a limit of 3 expenses per day, you're basically forced to upgrade to the pro version. I may have taken it into consideration if it was a one-time purchase, but a monthly subscription is ridiculous since I don't really need all the pro stuff..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helpful application. Easy to handle"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So now Instead of premium features they are charging for even normal features. Showed their colors..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app, but now it's useless. I have been using it for many years, but recently they just pushed people away. First, they added a 10seconds waiting time before adding any expenses.. Okay, annoying, but fair enough, it's free. Then, they added a daily limit of expenses that you can insert in the app. So it's basically useless now. Who wants to pay a monthly fee to just track the bills? Tons of alternative for free. Bye bye Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I really liked splitwise and used it all the time but now I can't add more than 5 expenses without it forcing me to stop or upgrade. Very annoying!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"you are taking advantage of people after making them rely on this app. No different than Ambani or Adani (yeah maybe the revenue, but who cares). you had to be this horrible. only 3 transactions per day. DISGUSTING."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Another great app gone bad. Basically forces you to pay now unless you want constant ads and 3 transactions a day limit for free users now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Android users need to suffer as they were able to launch pro on android till now. Worst app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many aggressive limitations on free version. Requesting people to share names of alternate apps in the reviews, so that we can all move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can use it for about 2 months and then you reach the ""daily limit"" and have to buy pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now u are also asking for money. where it will be splits..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise since 2014 but that stops now. It's not the fact that they're trying to push people to purchase Pro, I get it, you need to make money. It's the fact that they didn't even bother communicating that a change was being made to the Free tier to rate limit at 3 expenses per day. I missed the last month of entries in my house and now I have to pull up my statements everyday until I can finally clear it instead of doing it in one sitting. Trying out the Tricount app instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Facing difficulties while adding the exp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very good 5* app until recently introduced expense cap in free version of 3 per day. Now it's useless unless you want to pay £30 a year subscription. Will be transitioning elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The time of too much greed has come. Been a user for years, until about 2 weeks ago they started limiting daily expenses to just 3/day - which is a joke. I have removed the app and will never look back. A great alternative to this that just works is TRICOUNT - please support the competition, instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"**I'm happy to pay for your app, but what you're asking for is ridiculous. Don't introduce wait screens to punish me for your crazy pricing model. I'll just go elsewhere. I don't leave reviews often, but this is one gem of an app. Makes life with my SO much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a brilliant app before, now it's an useless garbage with limit of 3 expenses daily. And they're explaining the move behind it by saying that ""Splitwise includes rate-limits to prevent spam and bots from generating fake activity on our platform."" Who are you kidding? As a software engineer myself, I can tell you that if it was due to rate limiting issues, they'd limit it to 3 requests/minute, not day. And this way we clearly know that it was purely driven by greed..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transactions....uninstalled it after using for years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses can be added in a day after that we have to pay money. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely ridiculous that they decided to charge for a simple calculation. Time to say goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's ridiculous that premium is now compulsory for such a basic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wonderful app, works perfectly and effortlessly and has been a lifesaver for years.... Now ruined by an atrocious use limit and a ridiculous subscription model. £5 a month each for me and my wife? No chance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The current version is limited to adding three transactions per day. This is ridiculous and clearly has been done to push people to get the monthly paid subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update sucks!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I love Splitwise; it's one of the best apps out there. However, it ends today. I will move to another app after the update, as you guys have set a daily limit. When I want to subscribe, it shows a ridiculous price. Did you guys know how to do business?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent changes to the Splitwise app are highly disappointing. The restriction of adding only three transactions per day and the push to purchase the pro version for this basic functionality is a significant drawback. It's frustrating when you were used to a more user-friendly experience. I hope they reconsider these changes in the future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcefully asking for a pro is not at all a good move"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why limit expense ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app till recently, when they changed to have a limit of transactions per day to 3. Useless now, would have to move to some other app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer using it. Asking to pay for it and forcing the expense limits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I couldn't upgrade pro it's showing incorrect password"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To add expenses we have to take premium???? Dumb asf"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am very disappointed with the app changes, they are forcing me to go for the paid version. I can't add expenses and they have removed the free users existing features. If this continues i will definitely reduce the app usage and try to find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but now that they're limiting the number of expenses free users can enter per day, I can't recommend it. What a sleazy cash grab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"And that is how you spoil a good thing. Just 3 expenses per day ? Seriously ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app but they've gone crazy with their paywalls. I'm gonna have to transition away from these guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was using it for the past 10 years maybe, I would have been fine if they tried to monetize with ads or anything but saying only 3 expenses a day can be added and 10s wait between each of them is a buzzkill. Being from a tech background these things aren't in anyway prevention of bots or anything else that the company claims. It's just pure greed to make money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice job taking away features and charging for them instead of building up more functionalities. Get lost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update is extremly annoying and I'll be looking for a new app to use. Every time I try to add an expense, I have to wait ten seconds for the ridiculous ad to upgrade to pro. The update also only allows three expenses per day. I'd like to put the genius who thought of this in a headlock."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable app now that you cannot enter more than 3 transactions/day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Imposing daily limits for tracking is absolute trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using the up for more than 4 years, everything was perfect, until this week that they added an expenses limit and 10 seconds wait to add expenses unless you subscribe... I guess it is time to find an other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Long time satisfied user now on the edge of switching to another app because of those obnoxious pro banners and 3 expense limit. Please show me some ads or offer reasonable pricing model instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New restriction of 3 entries per day make this app almost useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Haha they added a daily limit of adding expenses. Speedrun any% to bad ratings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update makes Splitwise useless. They just changed their freemium model to max out at 3 transactions a day unless you pay. Guess they couldn't figure out any features that actually provide value behind a paywall, so they hobbled their free version to be annoying instead. Don't bother unless you want to pay a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"OMG this app has been asking for premium just because I have reached daily limit and I haven't added anything yet! Seems like you guys soo desperate to get money just for existing on my phone. SMH!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable, since the new update, you will need to wait 10 seconds to add every expense, while the (pro) version delivers nothing 😂😂😂 I am just switching to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app will see decline very soon. In order to operate in a country like India, you cannot ask 500 rs per year to split expenses. Only good salaried people will be able to pay this. They should explore other ways to earn money like displaying ads in the form of banners, forced video ads (limited), pro subscription at nominal prices, etc."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy monetization. Asking prices for premium are unreasonable. Will switch to a different app or a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, but the limitation to add expenses sound desperate! Please add functions that'll convince us to pay instead of making the app unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit is ridiculous. I've had Splitwise for years, happily using the free version, no need for the extras. Suddenly they're pushing the subscription and capping expenses at 3 a day and it's not great. Will move to a different app for sure if it doesn't change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I haven't opened the app in about a week, but I opened it today to add our expenses from the last 4 days. For every expense, I had a full 10 second ad for splitwise pro ($40 USD a year mind you), and after about 5 items, I was unable to add any more for the day. I am uninstalling right now. You can take your forced subscription model bull, and shove it. I'd rather use a Google spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"forcing for premium membership. going to uninstall soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time asking to pay when add expenses. Irritating 😞"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update makes the free version non-functional unless you only have 3 expenses per day. I set up a new group for a recent weekend trip with multiple people. Expenses entered went into a separate non-group list as well as the group list and cannot be consolidated. I would have paid before the trip if limitations were understood. Now our expense inputs are a mess. The free version is essentially useless. Not willing to pay after the trip to see if that will sort it out. Back to spreadsheets."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is unusable now after aggressive monetization."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update restricted to expenses limit...i have uninstall apo and find new one similar app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best app for shared expenses, now they only let you add up to 3 expenses per day or else you gotta pay a premium for something that is basically a spreadsheet. Not worth your time!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You can only add 3 expenses at a time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Plan A) create good software, make it popular, then use that as a base to create something way better and monetize it, but leave the existing one working fine. Plan B) Destroy what you did on A to force people into paying, while earning multiple 1-star review in the process. Guess which one they picked?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 transaction a day 🌚"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed with this new limitations, me, my friends and family been using this app for like 5 years and I always recommend to everyone, now we will need to look for something else. Bye Pvt0s"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoyingly makes you wait 10 seconds before adding a purchase"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new daily expense limit of 3 makes the app unusable. Changed review from 5 to 1 stars. They have lost a long time user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My application is crashing from 1 week why isn't happening"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging for featutes that used to be free, now need pro for more expenses? Only a limit of 3 per day is rediculous might as well find another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the recent update the apps changed drastically. Seems unstable and also restricting the number of expenses to just 3 transactions. The price for premium is extra ordinarily very high when compared to best premium tools available on the play store. After using it for more than 3 year may need to say good bye to splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the recent update, I've to wait 10 seconds before every single expense addition, and also can only add upto 3 times in one day (on the free tier). I can understand if they introduce Google ads on the side and what not, but both of these combined made this app complete trash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm Going to uninstall this app... Not required premium Version.. Useless app now.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version is not good anymore, limited ability to add expenses. One star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Premium is a loot"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit of three transactions per day is ridiculous"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for over 5 years. But now this recent update has made me look for another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No recomendable. El límite diario que han puesto va en contra de cualquier uso que quieras darle. La opción de dividir entre amigos de un día de fiesta ya no es útil."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great. But in the last few days, they added a very harsh expense limit (only 3 a day??) AND timers to add expenses for non-pro users. I get that you have to monetise, but restraining previously free and unlimited functionality is a pretty poor choice. Why not just introduce ads? Look for an alternative, can't recommend it in its current state."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You're absolutely ridiculous thinking that people will pay that amount per month for Premium, especially if everyone should upgrade to use the app. The service the app is offering is not worth the price. After 7 years... Bye. Enjoy your app that nobody will want to use anymore. As someone said already 10$ a year would make all of your happy users stay, instead we are all done with you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's not preferable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Becoming unusable for free version, 3 expense limit, 10s ads, cool down processing, team pushing too hard to switch to Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app, makes splitting expenses easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is messed up man, why bring the pay wall right after adding 3 expenses, can you just not make your revenue with ads?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great before the daily expense limit. Sad day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Congratulations to Spitwish who's now loosing all its users because of it's pay wall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been occasional user, using splitwise since long but just 3 transaction a day have totally irritating....won't suggest anyone using this app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Easier and faster to just go back to using a spreadsheet now, especially since it can't do currency exchange & limits the entries now (and then when it could, made it a paid feature)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It cannot possibly cost them so much to limit it to 3 transactions/day. Makes the application totally useless. A premium app should have premium and sophisticated features behind paywall. You cannot take basic features and put a paywall in front of it. They are massively overrating how much people depend on this app. There are other apps and means."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was such a good app until the stupid latest update! I have to watch an add before every expense and can add only upto 3-4 expenses per day! It sucks so bad now! Such a shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They unfortunately made changes where you have to wait for a timer to end in order to use any functions, and now you have a 3 input limit per day. Other comments say there are other additional limitations. They are essentially trying to force every user to pay $5 a month for a glorified calculator. $1 a month, I could get behind, but $5? Come on, that's ridiculous. We are simply going to move our expense tracking to Google Sheets unless they reel back these changes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money, really bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise for years but forcing users to watch a 10 second ad everytime they want to add an expense is ridiculous. The pro upgrade is crazy expensive for what it offers ($5/mo). I'd be willing to make a one time purchase for an ad free option. The hunt for a replacement app starts today. I don't need much. Just add expenses and split it between a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid. Seriously"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money hungry app dev"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't want pro and this is useless if you cap the number of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless now due to so many Ads. Simply stay away as it won't let you add more than x number of transactions+ you have to wait whole 10 seconds just to add 1 expense. Time to find a new app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's been OK, now you can only add 3 expanses per day for free, virtually making it useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best app in town to share expenses with friends and I always recommended everyone download it but atm is literally unusable unless everyone in the group pays for the Pro plan (3,99 € a month or 39,99 a year) because they added a limit to 3 transactions added per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They just introduced a waiting time of 10 seconds to add new expenses on the free version. This is so aggressive and unkind to your users that I cannot believe even the stakeholders thought it was a good idea. There's no point in using this one anymore, there are many alternatives out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They make you wait 10 seconds to add an expense now, unless you pay. I've been using it for years, but not any longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forced ad (10 seconds unavoidable wait) everytime you add an expense Also has a very low limit on number of expenses you can add per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Before it's okay but now they are forcing to purchase a subscription and one thing I will suggest to implement here, please provide every month's total balance but it's showing only three options,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit to expenses if not pro? This is a no go"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day really"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nobody will pay Rs. 1000 in India just for logging transaction. There are other ways of monetization that should be pursued in Countries like India."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changed to a paid app :( Subscription is too costly for the services offered. Its better to find a new one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New limit rule is ridiculous, you're better off using another alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely useless app after the recent update. Daily expense rate limit? On an expense tracking app? Deleting and moving on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nothing is free on the app anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They began limiting to 3 expenses a day suddenly without warning, making the app useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The limit where one can add only 3 transactions per day is disappointing. Uninstalled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall is a stupid way to lose your existing users. Multiple alternatives are available I suggest everyone to us other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop asking for money, we'll go back to excel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why a subscription model :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a new daily expense limit in the last update out of the blue. That's like stabbing your users in the back, plain and simple. The unlimited expenses is what made this app attractive and usable in the first place. Now that they are placing it behind a paywall I am afraid I will have to suggest everyone to ""look for a better app"", since splitwise no longer qualifies as good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until they implemented a 3 expense per day limit. I use Splitwise to track shared expenses with my spouse, so this is now practically useless as often I will make more than 3 purchases in a day (e.g. at weekends). Won't be upgrading to Pro as it is far too expensive, so congratulations on losing yourself a user!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic features become paid after latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Even the basic operations can't be done after the update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily expense limit defeats the purpose of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited my expenses per day without any comms"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app forces you to buy the splitwise pro and it's not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update of setting a daily limit on adding expenses or purchasing a subscription is pure bs. I'll be uninstalling the app if they do not revert the update. Its a simple application, many alternatives, even an excel sheet can do it. Putting a limit on its basic functionality is going to eat them bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The finance department at splitwise decided it was time to cash in on the (great) product they created, in the worst way possible (making it beyond annoying to use). Leaving aside that I believe the pricing model to not be adequate, which is why I never bought a pro subscription and never will, the app now has a 3 expense per day limit which renders it unusable. I suggest everyone reading to switch to competitors and move your expensing there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unable to put anything after updating this. Now this is becoming worst one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very useful app.. but after last update.. can only record 3 splits per day.. lol time to look for another app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They just introduced paid features thereby restricting simple features. Although they will revert this as consumers will move to other alternatives. Very predictable Splitwise! Better do it soon cuz unlike whatsapp it will be replaced."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good stuff, started out using it for a holiday, ended up using it for daily life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update makes this app unusable. 5 eur a month for a basic expense tracking app is a bit much. 10 eur a year is more appropriate. Was using this app since 10 years and used to recommend it to everyone. Won't be doing that anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using this app from 2018, but now they have imposed daily expense entry limit until the subscription. I would rather use another app than to pay them a ridiculous amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app crashes often. Throwing runtime exceptions to the customer. It's a payment related app, people are worried about their money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I know companies need to make money. I get it. If Splitwise thinks a daily transaction limit is necessary, whatever. But to launch that restriction without any warning, not even a pop-up at login, is unacceptable. I am uninstalling and will be seeking alternatives immediately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new expense limit killed the app. It's useless to me now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is a Good app but you have to pay for it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was such a fan of this app until they started unreasonably shoving the pro subscription in your face. The new restrictions for the free version make it unusable for anything other than occasion friends, and I can't recommend it to anyone anymore. Try adding value to the pro service instead of forcing ridiculous limits on the free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They have added such strict limits to daily splitwise, that people now have to pay extra for maintaining their expenses, which itself is hard to maintain 🙄 why do you even make such app, if you can not maintain basic needs for free of cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 Expenses per day what a garbage app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Four expenses max per day? You aren't that special. Enjoy going out of business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was absolutely terrible that they've put a daily limit on expenses!! It's better to use a Google sheet or some other free apps doing the same job. If they demand a pro version for some extraordinary calculations and results that's fine as before, but limit on daily expenses!! How can they justify it???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lol max transaction reached after 2 lol. Uninstalled immediately lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I mean it's a good app but with competitors that can almost do the same thing, limiting people to 3 splits a day is going to make em leave."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. In a recent update they added a daily entry limit for expenses as well as making you wait 10 seconds before adding each expense unless you pay for the premium version. I'd rather not pay for something I could do myself with a google sheet but with a fancy ui over the top"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly they introduced a limit on the amount of bills you can add a day. Ridiculous. Moving to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly there is a limit for the amount of transactions you can add. Time to find another alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not this app take charge for using his app.plz don't download this app.worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"need option to forgive payments owed to me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"new update brought daily limit on adding transactions which directly made the app useless you can only add 3 transactions a day now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After becoming a totally paid app, it is forcing existing users to either pay or leave this platform. Just 3 expenses per day? Seriously?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywall isn't the best way to go"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ask for money to add your expenses. The irony is you need to pay (for pro version) to split your bills and you can't split the that amount because everyone has to buy it. Such a crip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My partner and I use this app all the time to track our spending. It was 5 stars, but the most recent update has capped the maximum expenses you can add in a day to 3 which is a blatant grab at pushing people to upgrade to the pro version which is, in my opinion, overpriced for what the app is. Would go back to 5 stars if they removed the cap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent decision to limit daily transactions to 3 is a deal breaker."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and out of nowhere they want to charge $4 a month for adding more than three expenses a day!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad 😞 I have not yet done any single transaction on my own and now these developers don't want me to add transaction. Just One friend settle up and they say buy pro version. This app getting stupid.make sure to have basic functions free at least.now i have to wait till tomorrow to add transaction. Will definitely search for alternative app is you are going to keep this rule. Very very disappointed on app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Had been using this app to track payments since years. The recent update sucks which restricts us from adding more than 3 expenses per day. You can't force people to buy pro version this way. Please fix it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is limiting the number of expenses you can add in a day and forcing to buy the Pro version for some users, while there is no such limit for other users. Not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's not letting me enter more than two transactions per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Incredibly useful and well done. Edit: after using it for more than 5 years and recommending it to lots of people I'll be moving to another app. The limit of 3 entries a day has ruined it and the fact that they didn't give a heads-up is infuriating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What an absolute horrible UX move to limit your daily entries to 3. ""Here have an app to split all your expenses IF YOU PAY FOR IT. I paid premium for the features, that were premium. This is baseline functionality you are cutting for the sake of making money. The feedback in your comments is clear. Change it back. Don't kill your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expense per day is the deal breaker , splitwise is copying Spotify"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had been using Splitwise for 5 years now. But the 3 expense limit rule is stupid. It has ruined the app for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good app, however recent update only allows you to add 2-3 expenses a day unless you upgrade to pro, which makes it pretty much unusable for people like me who tally up their expenses at the end of the month, unless you pay money. Sad that their greediness got in the way of a good app otherwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They made restriction to number of balances too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was an amazing app until they made it accessible only to subscribers. I would rather pay once and use features. I cannot afford to subscribe to this every month/year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I loved it and used it for so many things, but since introducing a cap to daily expenses, it became useless. This is a horrible change, and I won't be able to use it anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No longer helpful after the recent push to switch to premium. Looking for an alternate app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly deciding to limit users to 3 expenses per day is ridiculous. I will be seeking an alternative and would recommend everyone else do the same. Using an app for years just to have it's core functionality artificially limited just so they can start charging a monthly fee is extremely disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for more than 5+ years already. But since the introduction of the waiting time per entry, and the daily limit per entry, this has been a deal-breaker for me. Will look for other apps to migrate to if this continues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only three entries for one day and i can't understand the payment option.. why we pay you. We can just use another app. Very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, and they just implemented a 3- expense limit per day for users, unless you pay a monthly fee. They've made this app entirely useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app but now that they only give you 3 expenses daily, will be moving on. Suggest you do the same."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily only 3 transection !!! After that they begging for pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We used this app on a 3 week holiday to USA. There were 3 people travelling and it was so easy to use to keep track of our spending...particularly meals and little bits and pieces. It made us confident we were able to share equally in our expenses, clear and easy to use. Liked being to enter different currencies as well... some of our costs were in GBP before we travelled. Can highly recommend. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The decision to cap daily limit of entry really is the classic corporate greedy move that don't understand the user base. What a poor decision"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier is literally unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Newest update limits entries firstly after a 10 second wait and then a set amount per day unless you subscribe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pro plan is too expensive. Free plan is hindering usability too much. Will seek alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment taken by Splitwise from Nippun on 25 Oct 2023( Gpay Receipt attached) for SplitwisePro but still not given any pro facilities and advertisement coming for buying Splitwisepro again and again. No response till now. Mail sent and also reminder also sent but no response from Splitwise till now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but we'll probably switch to a competitor's. We've been using splitwise for years and I've recommended it to so many people but it's not as useful anymore. Now there's a max number of expenses that can be added per day, unless you subscribe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I purchased splitwise pro for 1 year, after 1 week it says that i dont have a subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Monetization is important but forcing for a basic function like adding expenses. Then limiting and pause of 10 sec and totally block after adding 3 expenses. This is ridiculous and We will find alternatives"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This has been a fantastic app for years, but I going to have to find a new one now as they've decided to add a daily expense limit without telling anyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was fine but they probably decided they want to get rid of the free customers AND increase the fee for the ones they decide to stay. It is not the first time we see this. Anyone with a good free app? Splittr? Venmo? I'd rather pay another app than staying out of a blackmail. Changing app is not convenient, but this is ridiculous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very good in intial stage of working, but after few days it stops adding expense and asking for subscription and that's so demanding in high value.thats not worth keeping extra money for this....so that's only for rich people not for common man."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"From last update: various fixes and improvements??? 🤯 Are you kidding??? Now you limit the times one can add expenses per day??! Will find something else and my friends too!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This was a fantastic app until very recently, when they opted to impose a 3 expense per day limit, as well as an annoying cooldown for processing expenses. There are also some annoying minor changes around re-selecting who expenses are with, which I suspect are in place solely to support the above limits. I file my household's expenses en masse, and these limitations are both frustrating and crippling. Moreover, I would rather look for another app than be coerced into paying a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Love splitwise but 1 star because of push to buy splitwise pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst monetization strategy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to add expense in non-premium account. Only if you choose pro version you will able to add expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Gone from fantastic to terrible with the changes designed to force you to go premium. I'll find another solution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently paywalled the most basic feature I've been using for years. You can now only add 3 transactions per day without paying for their pro plan"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Well to start with outstanding! Good features and easily understood. I am really just a very occasional user. On a recent trip with my daughter (over a month) we used it for shared expenses. A little over halfway through my trip I was limited to about 2 entries a day with a repetitive advert pushing me to purchasing a premium subscription! Congratulations Splitwise I and many of the family and friends I have introduced will be moving to a competitor!!!! Who was the genius in msrketing?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rated one star since they have limited to 3 activities per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 entries per day with stupid waits. What a scam."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Amazing app, but the new monetization move doesn't make sense considering how many identical apps exist for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Promoting for pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update pay to use updating review again. Previous review: Amazing app when you travel in group or live. Good to keep track of money split."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app for years until now. Seriously, now there is a limit to entering only 3 expenses a day? It's time to move on to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added daily limits to number of expenses you can add with free account. Also added a countdown timer for adding new expenses to push users towards a subscription. I will be uninstalling and moving to an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit has ruined this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"timer to even add an expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm disgusted. Have been a user for only 4 years but loved it so much. Even recommended it to so many people. Now you guys please walk down the stairs to hell or heaven; anywhere you go people are going to spit on you 😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have used app for many years without problems and now they are limiting the number of transactions a day making it not user friendly. Not worth 40 price tag. Will take my business elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be the best app, i used it in every trip in the past 1 year. now with the daily limit option its killed. looking for an alternative solution 👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good, but could be better. Needs a ""things to bring/organise""... Non-monetary things, but that only one person should/can do. Task list organiser, per group. Who's bringing the towels? That kind of thing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update came without warning and now you are limited to 3 expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly limiting transactions to 3 a day with no heads-up is not nice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise used to be the best app for splitting expenses. But now they bully you into paying 45 euro's a year in order to use the most basic functionality. Which basically renders it useless. I just want a basic app to split expenses. I'll gladly pay for it. But not 45 euros a year...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unfortunately, added anoing ads before adding an expense and also added a limit to daily expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expenses limits have killed this app. Useless money grabbing. Shame shame shame shame."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Take away the ads and I'll use the app again. No thanks bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Entered all my expenses for a trip a few weeks ago, sent the link to my brother to enter his, and suddenly he can only enter 3 expenses per day without paying for Pro. Now I have to get another app that's actually free and re-enter everything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's messed up that now you have to pay monthly to add all the expenses you need It was an excelent app, now I'll look for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have introduced a daily limit for free tier. It is no longer usable since I'm adding all the expenses at once. Now it's easier to use a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why it is showing to get subscription all the time..i not able to add my expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They made everything paid. I think it's time to switch from Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a great app but after the last update i just let you only add 3 expenses per day!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I could only add 3 expenses per day without upgrading to pro, however my traveling friend could add unlimited expenses for free on her iPhone app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wao ab iske liye bhi plan lena hoga gajab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used this app for many years for free and was great, but now they've made it unusable unless you upgrade to pro for $40 / year - sorry not even close to worth that much. I'll make my own Excel spreadsheet to do the same thing for free I guess..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not useful after recent subscription model. Hardly useful for free accounts now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now limited to 3 expenses per day. Not useful anymore. You can earn by playing ads or something else but forcing to join pro subscription is not a good idea. Maybe find a alternative soon. Thanks for being with us till today."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Make payment system also to direct pay from splitwise app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads everywhere, have to see ads between every expense added and you can only add 4 expenses per day. Used to be good, now it's worthless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app goes on my ""essentials"" list when traveling with friends. Easy to keep track of who paid what across multiple currencies and clear reconciliation at the end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have used the app for years, but with the new limit to 3 transactions per day, I'm out. Also, there was zero warning or communication from developers about this change, terrible practice."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless. Limited to 3 expenses a day. Only. Unless you pay them for pro membership(Netflix is cheaper) This from an app that's purpose is to help you manage your expenses lmao. Embarrassed that I used to recommend this app to friends for roadtrips etc. Disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from a helpful app to an unusable one within an update...what a terrible way to implement freemium model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits how many expenses you can put in now. Max 3 a day. Hard to keep track for trips. Bye splitwise. Was good when you were working. Can't really use the app with that daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Restriction on using basic feature and asking to upgrade to premium. It is basically forcing your users to move to other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a wonderful app which I've used for many years, yet recently they've introduced the expenses limit per day to 3! Forcing you to get the pro version and all of your friends too in order to record the expenses. Might move back to excel sheets soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses are allowed, after it ask for pro subscription which is very bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Previously amazing until predatory monetisation was added: entries are now capped to 3 per day unless you pay a subscription of £30. Used to use it a lot, but will now be switching to an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was incredibly loyal user for more than 10 years, was recommending Splitwise to many of my friends, it was the app of choice for vacation or life budget splitting. Over the past weekend they just decided to destroy it completely. After adding my expense I've got ""daily expense limit reached"". What, which limit? Contacted the support and got quite a passive aggressive response and a confirmation ""yes, three expenses per day only"". Good job team, I'll never recommend it again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The free version is so restrictive it is more of a glorified demo as of 2023."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit is a pain now. Trying to search for alternative apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dodgy 3 entry limit then you get smashed with an ad pause. Chasing customers away"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling app. Because they are not allowing to add expenses beyond some limit. Asking to buy for premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update puts a daily limit of 3 expenses per day plus a 10sec add before each one. Made a useful app trash now unless you're willing to upgrade. Deleting it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great, now uninstalled due to latest corporate decision to lock the basic functions behind a paywall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was one of the most useful app available on playstore but now they ruined it completely. And it's not like we can pay once and use, it's subscription and basically all your friends have to pay for it to use like before. Gonna either search for something else or just get back to manual settling up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited options for free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the past 2 updates, the app stopped opening"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing app, and I would use it for all my trips. Since they added a pay wall so you can only add 3 expenses daily I will give this 1 star until remedied."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding expenses is now behind either a long wait or a paywall, and locks you out after a while. Useless now, move on to some other app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added 3 expense limit per day, have been using it for years. Gonna switch to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The concept is great, but I think there are some errors that cause faulty math calculations. Doesn't seem like the owed expenses are tallied correctly, and when the debts are settled up, it still appears that the amounts totaled in the group are off a bit, which can lead to disputes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but not worth the new premium price just to update a couple of transactions a month. Switching to Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version no longer useful for household budgeting as I can only enter three expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No warning before implementing daily limit of 3 transactions. Great app but the limit should be higher"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app was awesome for 'no-quibble' shared child expenses since getting divorced. Latest update has removed the ability to photograph receipts (now subscription only..) rendering the app useless for our purposes..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense daily limit?! Really? I wouldn't mind ads or the delayed input to be honest, but this is too much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The greedy app, only allow to add 3 expenses per day, will soon switch to other alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Application crashing repeatedly. Tried several install uninstall. Cleared cache but still crashing Dev team please fix the issue."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Glorified excel sheet asking for too much money..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Limited free accounts to 3 expenses per day with no communication."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was very happy with this app for the last 4 years until today... Well, apparently there is now a daily limit of 2 expenses per day! Unless you subscribe to the paid version of course! Thanks but not thanks. This is ridiculous! Well, I will find another app and delete this one... What a shame!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a great app untill they decided to implement the daily limit. Will look for something else for the next trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until they made you pay to use it with no warning! The free version is unusable. It's a big disappointment as the app was a great help before. Time to make my own version!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sadly there is just 3 expenses per day available without pro version. Why to do that with such a basic feature? Definitely not good business decision..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now limiting the free version and the paid version is so expensive. I'm using it a few times a year during a trip. It's ridiculous. Going back to Excel. Imagine that you pay $40 per year, then all your payment partners have to pay as well for it to be useful. Team: You have a bad business model. Look for a new one!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Same experience as the rest. Was a great app before but they have decided to cap the expense to 3 per day and I think it is a bad decision. Go find something other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limits on adding expenses in free version makes it a terrible choice for me. So this might be the last month I will be using this app. The app itself is good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's time to uninstall the app due to recent pro version update, since it was worth app but now I think people can avoid it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, now they have gotten greedy. No more free unlimited entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The activities list doesn't show dates but 2 days ago 3 days ago and such. Seems pretty medieval village style of remembering transactions. improve in that. However very convenient app. has eased life with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolute sham with no notice dropped a limit on the amount of expenses you can add per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once an easy to use free app, now has ads and pay-per use and put a cap on the number of expenses you add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Asking for money after the latest update. The apps become unusable. Can only record 3 transactions a day. Also annoyed by forced ad to be watched. Time to find other similar apps. I have been using this for over a decade. But with everything restricted after the update and only few features available on the free version, i am gonna switch to another one for sure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app. But now we can't upload photos via Android on the free version but Apple users can."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth paying for it. There are many free options in the market."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 expenses a day...whicb defeats the whole purpose??? What a stupid way to kill your app. Will just move to a shared Google sheet with partner/friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was using this app for a long time until the day I could not log in more expenses and was asked to pay for premium. No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for almost ten years... never again after the latest update My friends and I created a splitwise for our big trip but halfway through splitwise suddenly added 10 second unskippable ads to the ""add expenses"" screen and prevented me from creating more than three expense entries per day. What a bait and switch... I guess they won cuz I paid $5 just to enter in all my expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A simple app turned worst in greed of money making via worst policy. Can't use an app with limit to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have paid 1 year subscription but still app is not upgraded to pro. Team please check on priority"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not being able to update all transactions due to daily limit, and it ask to upgrade it to pro version which is not available in Nepal..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app was great for years and I recommended it to all my friends, but now after entering just 3 expenses tonight the app won't let me enter expenses at all unless I pay for Pro. So now it's useless. The UX was nicer than a spreadsheet but the functionality I use is just basic addition/subtraction. If this is going to be the new way it goes once I'm done with this month's expenses in a few days I'm going to delete the app. Too bad - it was a convenient, simple thing for years that I liked."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The daily expense limit is really low."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You would regret limiting the maximum expenses per day as a premium feature. Basic functions needs pro version. Seeking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"daily expense limit? what a joke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Recently instituted a 3 expense limit per day for free users, so this important to be aware of if you don't want to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Amazing app. Well set out, unfortunately missing some features like concurrent payments and such, even on pro account... OH WAIT. They've decided to LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TIMES USERS CAN GENERATE PER DAY UNDER THE GUISE OF BOTS? OH I CAN'T ADD MORE THAN 3 IN ONE DAY GOD FORBID I HAVE MORE THAN 3 THINGS TO ADD A DAY? Liars you are you trying to push people to use pro. Disgusting move, will be moving away from this app to find a better alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New 10 second wait and expense limits suck. Waste of time as a free version option. Will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get that monetization is important, but it seems pretty ridiculous to limit daily expense entries to 3 a day. I do think the app is good, but it's not really worth using if I have to pay to do the most basic function of splitting expenses. I would be interested in paying if Splitwise could show analytics on spends or suggestions on how I could save money. But, paying a subscription fee to add expenses? No, thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit added now! The app sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They recently made changes where without pro version you need to wait 10 seconds to add expenses and can't add more than 3 expenses a day...wat?!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version allows to add only 4 expenses per day, and that also for every expense that I want to add, I have to wait for 10 seconds. Seriously. That's really low and desperate to force user to buy the premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1 star for recent daily limit change"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application for split your expenses among friends families."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Features are good. Have to uninstall as it allows only limited expense entry per day. Must have to purchase pro version. Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update is really really poor. Limit of 3 is too low. No need to be greedy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been a daily user of the app but the recent update made only 3 expenses to be added. Highly disappointed with the update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be essential to my life, but recently added daily expense limits so it's useless to me now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is a limit how many expense you can entry in a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was one of the biggest admirers of the app. Have used it for 8 years and had brought all my friends to it. However I am highly dissatisfied with their pay to use model! I do not mind ads, I understand its a business but limiting the daily transaction limit is outright compulsion to buy premium. Imagine a group planning to use it on a trip. Do you think they would have just two or three expenses a day to log? I would have to find something similar now. They need to reevaluate!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free is limited to 3 transactions per day. This makes the app nearly unusable. Moving to another app for the foreseeable future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They killed this app with the 3 expenses a day limit on the free version, I will definitely uninstall it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"While I understand that developers need to monetize the app, hiding basic functionality (adding an expense) behind a paywalled subscription without giving users any notice just shows that they don't care about the users. On top of that, there is no lifetime subscription so if I'm not interested in a y new features I still have to pay yearly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good design. Functions well. But what pissed me off is the 10 seconds wait time before add an expense for non-pro users. It's just the most awkward time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the most recent update it is exceedingly frustrating to use. Ads on every expense with no cooldown and a daily limit on how many expenses you can add. I understand the push for monetization but this is an absolutely terrible experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version recently limited to 3 expenses per day and a 10 second wait before adding each expense. Now unusable as a free version. Forcing members to pay for premium for what used to be free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Longtime user who will be uninstalling due to the ridiculous limitation of 3 transactions per day (AND being forced to watch 10 second ads when adding those) unless I upgrade to Pro. Plenty of alternatives to this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't understand there is no point for us to download this app if we just put in two and entries and it tells us to upgrade to split wise pro there would be a better app I am sure but never download splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unusable at 3 expenses per day. It was a great app. I would have been happy to buy if it were a one time pay. Looking for alternatives now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They ruined the app with charge limits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for the past 5 years and I'm really disappointed by their new ""limits"" rule. now you can add just 3 expenses per day! I usually load all my expenses at the end of the month. this change coming in without any warning or notification on the app is really infuriating! you need to subscribe to pro and pay $3/mo to add more expenses. I'm gonna have to find another alternative now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be a fantastic app, but I guess I'll just go back to Tricount as I absolutely hate the way they now force you to use the pro version if you want a decent user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ads and daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"will only allow me to add 4 expenses per day unless I buy the pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced a rate limit and a 10 second delay before adding an expense. Now pretty much useless for its intended purpose unless you go pro. The free version should be taken down as essentially unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 expenses a day on the free account..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but the caps on use and outrageous subscription for the pro version makes it utterly useless. Regret ever even recommending thos to friends and will be installing the second I find an alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was an amazing app, have been using it for over two years to split costs of travels, with different currencies / groups etc, never an issue and I would have definitely recommended. Now they decided to set a daily limit of entries, firstly letting you add one after waiting 10 seconds and then not at all until the next day.. unless you subscribe. It is an extremely sad and disappointing marketing move. We can just use a different app instead of paying you for this ridicolous change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed by recent update. I wish i could give a half star to this update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using Splitwise for atleast 5 years. Been a huge propent on it, got family members and friends on it over the years and we use it daily. Sadly the new ""wait 10s"" to enter an amount is annoying and why we're looking to move to another app. Way to kill your app I guess. Bad UX / price wall = bye bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy Devs ruined app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but recently they introduced a limit of 3 transactions per day unless you pay for the Pro version. This limit is ridiculously low and means the app is nearly unusable to me now. I will be moving on to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A new update made the app unusuable without a subscription. You wait for 10 seconds per entry, and are limited to 4 or 5 entries per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a very useful app until they went and applied a daily 3 free expenses..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"have to watch an ad to add an expense... very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be an incredibly useful app. They recently added a non-skippable 10 second advertisement for the ""pro"" version before adding any expense. Incredibly annoying, totally over the top."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not what i needed and certainly not wanting a subscription application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Handy app before they locked basic features behind a paywall. Having to wait 10 seconds before adding an expense doesn't make me want to pay for premium, it makes me want to use a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on transactions implemented with no warning to its customers. Worse is they say it's to reduce bot activity. If there was a warning and you'd give the actual reasons, I wouldn't be mad. Will finish transactions and go to Tricount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It used to be one of the best apps on the market before they capitalised everything. Now there's a limit to how many transactions you can add or even searching expense. Hate this kind of stuff. I understand the other benefits and they are good but monetising the basic stuff is wrong. Was going to upgrade soon. Will uninstall the app now soon. And I handle the accounts of 15-20 people so expect them to leave it soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rate limit of 3 expenses a day makes the app basically useless and is clearly designed to drive people to pay. Wouldn't recommend to anyone now, which is a shame as have used for years prior to this change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Do not like the new feature on waiting for 10s to add a transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Price gouging out of nowhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit on adding expenses. What kind of feature is this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update to push the paid model with delays and limited expenses made me uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"4 entries per day is nonsense... I would be willing to pay for a permanent license (up to like €40-50) but a subscription for a function one could replicate in Excel is not okay. At least not for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update give only three expenses add. It is sucks. This beat the whole reason why people use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but since the introduction of daily expense limits for free users, I've been forced me to move to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app for the limited features I used it for. Adding a cap and timer is brutal. Have fun losing users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly a daily limit (a total of THREE entries...). Can no longer track expenses between my partner and I. Very disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a brilliant app but ever since they started limiting expense to THREE A DAY and instituting a waiting time to add expenses its become almost useless for big groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only 3 entries per day...Very disappointed...now looking for any other app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now everything is behind a paywall. Who is paying £31 (not even a one off payment) to be able to add more than 3 expenses a day? What a sell out"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary expense of splitwise pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous monetization changes. New changes show a 10 second ad before adding an expense and limit your daily expenses to 3(!). Dealbreaker"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money hungry and delusional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"WAS a fantastic app. Now capped at three expenses per day unless you buy the overpriced premium subscription, now gladly moving on to something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Usefull app to track expenses with your friends and family members, but recurring payment for a subscription to be able to enter more than 3 expenses a day. No thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added 10 seconds waiting to add an expense record for not subscribed users and daily limit of transactions. I did not need any of the extra features but now I will move away from Splitwise as I don't want to be milked by them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I purchased pro subscription, money was debited from the account but pro subscription failed, neither the money is returned, nor I have any chat support"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Did you hire an Ivy League laureate manager? It sounds like one of these guys' brilliant ideas. How to lose users in one day :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense limits and ""Buy our premium"" adversiting getting more and more annoying. I would have payed a fixed amount for this app, as it was really nice and basic. But it seems the Premium Features are not really worth it and the base version is annoying as hell now. I am not paying a subscription fee for such a basic app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was already running with hiccups, and now they limited the amount of expenses you can write per day on the free version. LOL! As if the app was so exceptional it couldnt be replaced easily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The fact that you think you can show me an ad to upgrade to Splitwise pro and make me wait until the ad is over to add an expense is the most rude shock of my life. Also, you expect me to have a limit of adding only 3 expenses per day unless I want to pay for a pro subscription?? After having used the app for 5 years, today I uninstall it. I would find it more pleasurable to carve out expenses on a stone tablet and do the math using my fingers than ever use your app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The whole limitations thing is a joke. Just use an ads banner or something you morons."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The pay wall (pay limit) to add upto 3 expenses is definitely a deal breaker. The product has been used massively by the people but it seems that they are being forced to buy the Pro plan. Although the price point is not so high on an individual basis, however, with a price sensitive user base ""splitwise alternative"" keyword seems to be on surge on the search. Good luck to Splitwise, I hope they reflect on this decision, they are more ways to get users to Pro without forcing them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version requires 10sscond wait to add any expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app until the latest update limited number of expenses that can be added per day and introduced ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is somewhat unstable. The decision to limit the daily expense entries allowed to 3 made this app worse."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, people I select to add to an expense also keeps getting randomly reset"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App really went down the hole with recent update. Maximum additions per day really make the app terrible to use now. Will be using a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After they went pro - things went down. Limiting the amount of daily expenses, giving a 10 second delay that's masked as an 'Ad', made it all a poorer experience. Will be looking for other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worked great until they forced you to use the ""pro"" version for any more than three transactions per day... Obviously the app developers are hungry for money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently added 10 sec forced delay on adding an expense, it destroys the whole experience of adding expenses, its like splitwise is discouraging to use splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need daily limit is ridiculous. It has been free. 39$ a year is not justified. You are going to lose users. I am already looking for and alternative! Shameful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We've been using splitwise to track household expenses for 7 years, but that ends today. I can understand the interstitial ad for splitwise pro when the app starts—it's annoying but you can skip it. But there's now a TEN SECOND FORCED INTERSTITIAL for it on EVERY EXPENSE you input. I don't appreciate having my time wasted. The app has always been buggy and clunky, and is simply not worth $5 a month. $1/mo or $10/year would be more reasonable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy Pro subscription. Uninstalling..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Agora limitam em 3 despesas diárias, ficou HORRÍVEL"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise pro tactic is the worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced an incredibly restrictive three-transactions-per-day limit with no warning."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very functional but the daily limit for expenses is ridiculous. It wasn't like this before, kind of disappointing. Uninstalling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really great app. Due to the new cap on 3(!) expenses per day it's become de facto unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limit of expenses is killing this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Boo! $4 per month for this is ridiculous. Or now I'm limited to three entries a day? 10 second ads? Get lost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"First it's free then asking payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There are some unwanted steps. If I want to add an expense by default, it splits the amount equally. If i want to split unequally, i have to take 4 extra steps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was good earlier now they have set a daily expense limit of 3. You could have done monthly or weekly if there were genuine concerns of bots"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Using it from long but now looks it is useless with limitations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It used to be an amazing app but with every update they remove something from the free version I cant add images to expenses and the daily limit on transaction is just absurd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Shift to SplitKaro Splitwise think they are the best and charging a premium just to calculate simple expenses. Splitkaro is way better and its free. Has variety of different options which are useful too in complex calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Yeah, paywalling add expense (the most basic function) to push for Splitwise Pro is more likely to get me to uninstall rather than get pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"ok to add adds, not ok to block adding expanses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad idea to limit expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free tier became limited to several expenses per day. It made the app next to useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Was a fantastic app but have gotten greedy and try to make you pay subscription. Per person. So now you can't use in groups unless every single person in that group subscribes. That's £40 x 5 people just for one holiday. Couples will pay £80 per year. 😲👎👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but it was turned into a bad user experience if you don't have the premium plan. If you want people to pay for extra services, don't do it by making the free version of the app annoy the user into buying premium for services that used to be in the free version before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved this app, recommended it to everyone but can't add more than 3 expenses anymore, so now it pointless having it. Im not paying just to be able to add more expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app I have subscribed to pro feature however it lacks creating custom category. We need to choose only with given categories. Hopefully someone from the team notice this feedback and add the feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why a 10s pause??? The idea to serve sds and have users wait 10s before adding an expense is atrocious and a horrible user experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the free version of the app is unusable after the last update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Loved the app, now they've stuck a paywall on more than 3 additions a day. I don't want any of the pro features this is just greedy, there was already adverts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the last update it seems we are being forced to take splitwise pro or else we have to watch the add. The best way out is to uninstall the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What used to be a very useful app to split household costs or a night on the town with friends has gone to a useless app overnight, without any warning. Now you need to watch ads between every item you try to book and it's limited to three items a day. Or you can shell out a ridiculous amount of money (per user!) to make it useful again. A real pity, and it will be sadly missed, but we're out of here"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used 3 months after that asking to take subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update with a 10 second ad EVERY SINGLE TIME you need to add an expense is just bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Time to leave, showing ads was one thing, which was fine but limiting expenses to 3 per day is a bad move by you guys. Looking for alternatives and I am sure will find many. Time to say bye bye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Man y'all gonna lose users real quick with this latest update. Listen to the users or see the user base plummet. If there was a reasonable subscription for basic functionality or a group/house subscription our household would subscribe but expecting 4 subscriptions from one household is ludicrous. We're just going to add multiple items to a single expense. Groceries. Done. Giving Settle up a try looks much better for instance group once off premium subscription, I'll pay for that!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has become a paid app now. Will move to another fare share app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding limited expenses is causing a lot of trouble (Just 2 Expense add per day), waiting for the next day, the next expenses are forgotten. We are moving to another application. *Other things are good *"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Made it mandatory to wait for 10secs to add an expense that too only two expense a day. Otherwise you need to take pro. This is outrageous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience with pushing the ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowing 3 expenses a day makes this app unusable if you don't pay for the subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Will be leaving the app as new limit for adding expenses defet the purpose. Will moving to other alternative with same features without limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Now this app has a limit to how many times I can log an expense. Insane, I've been using this for almost a year and now this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy devs charging us for adding expenses in a day 🤡 what a bunch of bullcrap 💩"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using the free version for a very long time. But since the update you can only add 3 expenses per day my rating is now a 1 star. Why not add a few ads at the bottom then you can have a ""purchase ad free version for $5"" or something. But having the app being kneecapped is dumb. I wonder if the CEO made this decision to get more money from the consumers..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Works well but now they make you watch an ad for their pro accounts with each expense you add. I'll be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience compared to years ago. I understand trying to make money, but the changes otherwise have been poor. It went from being intuitive to complicated and waste of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing users into a wait period to push your pay-for-service plan? What a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used for years and love it, however did not realise this is now capped at 3 expenses a day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was using Splitwise for more than 5 years. It was everything that I needed. But now, with this outrageous cash grab functions, this app became unusable. 10 seconds to register a purchase?! Really?! 3 registers per day?! Why?! This is example of utter greed! Shame!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new daily expense limit just made the app unusable. It's no longer a good option for free users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly there is a 10 second ""wait time"" without the Pro version if you want to add an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not worth using now, I am searching for alternatives. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit is a shameless money grab, especially for an app with so many ads to begin with. Uninstalling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They updated the app so that you can hardly use it before having to pay $5..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"there is one problem in this app, when i added a person in my friend like ""jimi"" that know in my contacts, he showed for all users that have jimis number as ""jimi"" while maybe he saved in their phone knowing as other name, it must work by themselves information, not by other users info thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app used to be excellent, but now whenever I add an expense, a 10-second advertisement for Splitwise Pro pops up. This constant interruption has made the app incredibly frustrating to use. I will start searching for an alternative as soon as I find the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately they let you use it for a while and then make the tool basically useless unless you pay an unreasonable amount.. shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's an amazing app, very useful to split expenses in couple life and while on travel. I'm rating only 2 stars because recently they have added a limitation to the free plan, you can only add 3 expenses per day per person. In this way it's simply impossible to use it anymore. I'll probably use a similar application on next trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4,- per month? You serious? Super intransparent with homany expenses you get per day. Apparently 3 Website still say its unlimited"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"To app for shared finances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is worse after the latest update that it is mandatory to take pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was fun while it lasted without the ad experience. 👏🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very low limit of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Devs....... Please don't be d*cks. These adverts that you have pushed out are so bad they will simply result in years long users like myself abandoning the platform in favour of the competition. Neither myself or anyone else is going to watch an advert for every expense they add.  Shame on you for removing core functionality in a push to have people pay!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The basic functionality of adding expense is now a premium feature. You can't add more than 3 expenses per day. How brilliant is it! Premium should give additional features, not make basic features as premium. Now Splitwise becomes almost useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible change. Limitation on expenses addition to a group. Not acceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It allows you to add only 3 expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I loved to use this app but because of their recent rule change where you can barely add any expenses per day, I had to change apps. Fairly happy with the ""Settle up"" app. Sad that greed destroyed that app, maybe one day it will be a good app again but I changed apps now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App has bugs and glitches, it shows different ₹ at different time interval"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Why I am being asked to pay for the pro version?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy pro // expense limit set to 4 // Worst way to get people to buy pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for a long time but it's become basically useless since they added a limit for how many expenses you can add per day. (It's only 3!!!) Sorry but that's ridiculous. Already deleted the app and switched to Tricount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed with daily expenses adding to 3 just 3 only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Does not allow more than 2 entry per day forces to buy pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would give it a higher score but recent restrictions have made it much less useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They just severly gimped the free version of the app by both adding a 10 second wait time before adding an expens, and limiting the number of expenses to 3/day. If only the expense limit was added I migtht've continued using it, but as of now I'm actively going to look for a replacement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. But sucks nowadays, limit the number of daily expense I can add per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't understand how greedy the developers have become. Now, you're only allowed to add 3 entries per day if you don't have a premium subscription"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expense calculate krne ke liye bhi ab paise dene pdenge kya 😒"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app but now every time you add an expense an ad for split wise pro pops up for 10 seconds. Makes the app incredibly annoying to use. Will be looking for an alternative as soon as I have time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice application for tracking expenses. One feature suggestion - Merge transactions In this feature, multiple transaction amount get added and the single transaction is shown in the expenses. This will be helpful since there are times where we have to pay via upi multiple times at a place during same visit to it.(ex : Mcdonald where we have to pay for each meals individually if we order using there application)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to keep track of tour expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor experience. For the free version, too many features are disable and only 3 expenses can be added per day. For me that sounds like a NO-go-to app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to like Splitwise but will stop using them after they recently put a pay wall up after a maximum of three entries every 24 hours."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great and very useful app for trips. Update: No longer worth it, the 3 transaction limit a day makes it useless for pretty much everything. Even for some night outs... We'll have to migrate to something else..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update has made the app unusable. Adds for every expense, max limits on expense. Time to switch to a Different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Putting a daily limit and forcing users to move to pro is unacceptable for such an household app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest version limits daily expense entries to just 3. Making it impossible to use unless you go premium. I hate this app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This was a great app, but now it limits you to only adding a max of 2 expenses per day! This is a sad attempt to push users to paying for pro, I am looking forward to using an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app which makes spending n balancing so much easier than excel sheets and hour long discussions!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"there's a cap on expense additions per day after the update, this is a basic functionality which should be available for all users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 addable expenses per day without Splitwise Pro? Disappointing 'update'"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app for daily expenses but recently they've had this weird daily expense limit that kicks in and there is no clear indication on what is the daily expense limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now has 3 entries per day limit which make it impractical. Need to pay $50/year for additional. Blindsided customers by implementing this without notice and official reply from Splitwise is that it was added to prevent spambots."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was a great app until most recent update. It now only lets me add 3 expenses a day and it looks like to add more I need to pay for pro. For an app I use only really on group holidays, this makes the app fairly useless. Appreciate they need to make money but feel it could be done better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After using splitwise extensively for years, the recent changes to the free tier basically neuter the app for anything serious. A serious disappointment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The daily limit is ridiculously low. If this is not changed soon then I will stop using the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do you think people who care about money want it split equally, will spend money to buy splitwise pro ? .It was really good when we did not have the daily limit. I will be searching for another app that does not have daily limit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Due to recurring payments, I can't able to buy it.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So disappointed with the recent update, what the heck happened.. It was working great and suddenly you decide to add in a limit of only 3 expenses per day, and you have to wait through an ad before each one!?? This makes Splitwise unusable for most people. Like others here, I'll be looking around for something else if it doesn't change soon. It was working so well, I don't get why this was necessary. For others - you can go to apkmirror, download version 23.8.1 and you can go back to no ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nice app, works pretty well and smooth, however the ads for the pro version and the limit of daily expenses have become annoying. I need to wait for 10 seconds to enter an expense? 3 expenses daily? That's one way to ensure I won't by the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to easily share expenses and track own total costs for a trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App should reminder first about daily limit of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to add more expanses in a group in a day and it's pushing me to buy splitwise premium.The whole function of this app is to track expanses, and you are paywalling it behind a pro subscription. Last trip I'm tracking with this, then uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free part is pathetic. This was a good app but with the pro part you can't use this app anymore. I already made myself a better version of Splitwise. Will see if I can release this in the app store"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Seriously? Only 3 expenses per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There's a limit of 3 entries per day now and a 10 second counter to be able to add these entries. Wanting to move to a subscription model is understandable but the new limitations are excessive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing more than two times per day to track the expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It solves lot of our time...very user friendly developed application...MUST use for any group travels n events."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Earlier app was excellent but after updating it showing ads for every new expenses and suggesting to upgrade to pro . Pathetic experience now looking for alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Allowing just 2 expenses par day to push premium is pretty bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Annoying experience by forcing users to subscribe pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"4 expense daily limit? Really? Have been using this app for close to 9 years. Looks like it is time to bid good bye as they have introduced limits if you are not a pro user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 4 transactions a day? No problem, uninstalled and switched to TRICOUNT. It's free. Oh and here's a 1 star review for you guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Charging for more than three transactions out of the sudden? D1ck move green dude. D1ck. Move."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited the amount of expenses per date for the free membership. Basically stoping the usefulness of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise is not working on android 13 (vivo t2 pro 5g). Any solution?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"putting a daily limit and giving only 3 daily expenses to free users is unacceptable. I am deleting splitwise and will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"they change there model... puting a limit of how many entry you can do a day to 3 and the third one you need to wait for there add about the premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They now limit you to 3 expenses a day. This is the primary point of the app. Don't download this. Find a new one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was great until they updated and limited expenses to a limit of 3 per day. If reverted back to how it was, rating would be 5/5."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Last update ruined it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app but now is limited to 3-4 entries per day :(( will probably change to another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App. Very very helpful for group travel expenses track . Thank you Solitwise team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Split wise is a great app for managing your daily expanses with friends. You don't need to worry or hesitate to share your daily living expanses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful! Some days it won't even let me put in one expense! Find something else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly the amount of transactions you can add per day is highly limited and they start charging a montly fee to use the app in the most basic way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Sometimes it crashes. Not able to open it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding a paywall on the most basic feature (Adding Expenses) is beyond stupid. It's like WhatsApp allowing to send 3 texts or Instagram allowing to scroll 3 reels a day and locking the free app until the next day. I understand you have to earn your bread and butter. I think an ad after a few entries is reasonable. With your current model, you'll just be killing your user base."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Before 24oct2023 this the best application that we are using for money reminder but now they are doing business the service which are free now they ask you money for using this app. Thanks for the update definitely we are not going to use this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for road warriors"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please post what new alternative app you guys using to avoid this stupid idea of limiting 3 expenses per day, useless app now let's all moveeee!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"At free version only can use it 4 expenses per day"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much for providing such a marvellous application, but I have a suggestion for you guys. 1) There should be an option to select multiple users when you are adding expense. 2) Delete or edit an expense should be occured by its creator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't use it anymore if u have more than 3 friends they will ask for payment 3 per day limit what is wrong with them?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It seems after the latest update it has become mandatory either to get the Pro subscription or to wait and watch the 10s pause screen. Also without the subscription one can only add a limited number of expenses per day. I took the subscription but still it is not reflecting in the app while the Google Play receipt shows that the subscription was successfully purchased. Mailed the splitwise support ID but to no avail. I still cannot use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update has made the app almost useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So far it's been great but recently they've started limiting the number of bills I can add per day to push me to buy split wise pro. Paying 4$ a month for something that I spent a couple of minutes a week on is pretty ridiculous tbh. It would be better to provide ads instead. Developers please reconsider"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using splitwise since last 6+ years but now seems that you are becoming more and more greedy first you turned off add image option and made it as pro and now you are limiting the basic add expense feature as well this is really frustrating. Thanks for all this years, goodbye."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app was perfect for it purpose, great to organize your travels or house expenses. Now they add limits to the expense you can add (I think 3 per day), and if you want to be able to add more expenses you have to subscribe, monthly or annual payments. I will uninstall it and just use a shared excel spreadsheet..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When i added several new contact in splitwise with same number and continued, its says the ""ibrahim zaid has the same number "" Who is this ibrahim zaid?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Membership lene ke baad bhi.. membership ka benifit nahi de raha hai..Error aa raha hai.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Been using it for years, perfect, suddenly with no warning I'm pay walled for adding more than one expense a day. Corporate greed kills another great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Silently adding a 3-expense a day limit without prior communication is really sad. If this limit was going to be added, at least it should have been announced earlier. Further: I don't really understand the business model to force users to pay now. A gradual limit imposing + increasing ads strategy would be better to get people to pay for premium. When people suddenly see the limit, they feel ""blackmailed"" to pay and this puts people off - I would have actually paid for the app but not anymore!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily Limit is a joke! I'd like to support the developers and have an add free one but 30 bugs is far to expensive for the purpose ... I guess will leave now - limit of 3 is ridiculous - smart move 😀"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing my review to 1 star . First they removed option to add bill photo then now you can't add more than few entries in a day . Time to move away from Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super simple spending tracking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"just changed their business model. you have to pay now for logging expenses. seems that I am forced to switch to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app from 4 years now, but the new update of allowing to add only 3 expenses/ day has ruined it all. Straight from 5 star it goes to 1."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good idea. Decent software. Limiting the ""Free"" version to only 3 transactions per day is overly limiting. It is not worth it to pay for this so I have uninstalled the product."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent change to a daily limit of 3 expenses is ridiculous. Make your subscription more appealing through other features instead of driving away your users. I've been using this app for 4 years and will be leaving it behind for something else because of this singular change. Well done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How dumbest idea that these guys limiting the basic feature of this app and forcing us to take subscription. Now for a day we can only add 3 expense. Whoever came-up with this idea to loot money from their app users is utter senseless person. I'm transferring my all transaction to alternative app and switching to that.. RIP Splitwise. Good Bye"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Because of UI. I am not able to edit transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good untill new update which limit number of expenses can be add. Totally unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application, Very good TA support."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Attaching image to transaction is moved to pro version. Disappointed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is crashing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit to force users to pay for their Pro Version... I don't think so. Moving to a better and FREE splitting app! Splitwise you just ruined you business."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good app. I've been using this for 3.5 years but now it's not letting me use. It's saying I've to buy splitwize pro. Even if I'm trying to add a simple expense it's not letting me add anything. Please help if you can."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit makes free app unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Experience is totally ruined as now splitwise has setup daily expenses limit and it is very low. This is very very big discomfort for the user. If company wants to earn money they can try different business models but this surely will hurt you as the value proposition offered to consumer is being affected majorly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"used to be a great app, but has now been made completely unusable by the push to get you to pay for premium blocking basic features. Will be deleting and finding a new app asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"For Indians who are very away from standard English. It becomes very difficult to understand the language standards that app uses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ekdum bakwas. Asks you to upgrade everytime. Uninstalled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"limited free number of transactions -> replace"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update crippled the free app, don't bother downloading."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly u are forcing for membership.. too bad.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses a day on the free version? In a week I will be using some other app. Good luck with your new business model."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"3 expenses per day. Wow."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app specially for bachelors But kindly add one option - for rate of interest , actually this will better for all users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The purpose of this app contradicts it's own with their new update introducing splitwise pro and limiting the number of expenses to 3 per day totally sucks. There are better free available apps in playstore other than splitwise which does the same thing but for free. I have been using splitwise for more than 3 years now I am just disappointed, they could have atleast made 6 expenses per day for free users."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worked fine before but now when I click on the add expense button it just opens the get splitwise pro banner and if I close that it just goes back to the expenses. So I can't add any other expense! Please fix it or I think I have to search for another app to track household expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update requires you to have paid pro account to be able to add multiple expenses per day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to use after the imposition of expense limits. Please have ads for free users instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keeps taking away features to make you pay for a monthly subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing. Doesn't open up. I tried reinstalling, still does not work for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free version user. Before the update, the only downside of this app for me was the lack of option to set the expense time. After the update, it now makes you wait 5 seconds before you can add an expense, and only allows up to 5 entries per day. From ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐ real quick."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Long time user here. Totally turned off by the developer removing existing functionality (unlimited expenses) to make us pay for features we don't really need. Will have to look for an alternative to shift for Unlimited expenses. Really disappointed😞.!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"can only add 3 expenses per day on free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why is there a cap on daily expense entry"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Downloaded it but not opening due to some error showing. Plz help"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate your new nag screen that comes up every time I want to add a new expense. Also, what the hell is this new limitation of the number of transactions I can add a day?? This is a shame"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Stops the arguments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing but since adding in daily expense limit unless you use pro it's pointless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily expense limit in the free version? Really? I've been using this app for years and now with this update I'm feeling like it's time to let go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"great idea of an app. but the app gets locked behind a pay wall after 2 expenses. 7$ per month doesnt really justify the price for this app in my opinion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The daily expenses limit (only 3!) for the free version is really limiting the use especially when going on holiday. Loved it initially but will look for alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Starting showing add Mann uninstalling if I found any alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forces everyone involved to create accounts. Can't add more than a few items per day, so for vacation this is practically useless. Can't add people to an item after it's created. Can't arrange items within the day. Doesn't show price on items that aren't shared."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to add the expance asking for money very bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to track all expenses when on a trip when costs need to be shared. Also good for just tracking self expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Membership to add more expenses is horrible. Why should I pay for this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have been using the free version for a long time. A recent update that limits the number of expenses that can be added per day for the free version made the app useless for me. They removed a basic functionality without even informing the user. Not sure why the team made this decision but I don' t think this is a good way to convince the old user to pay or attract new users. I switched to a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money minded management made stupid decision of 3 expense per day limit. Not gonna use this useless app again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They make you pay subscription half way through a list..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basically not a 'free' app anymore. The latest update makes you wait between each expense and limit the number of expenses per day. Absolutely unusable as a free app, I'm going to switch to a different one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Including a banner that stops me from adding expenses for 10 seconds only to pay for the pro version seems extremely abusive. There is no add on the banner! They just want to force to pay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been an active user for a long time now. One of those apps that contributes significantly towards making life a lot less complicated. Wish they incorporated an expense tracker into their pro version. Would have been a one stop app for all things expense related if that was the case. Hope they consider it someday. A big thank you to the team for doing what the do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app works very well! The interface and features are perfect. 5/5 couldn't get better. Maybe even more icons for expenses?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"need to shift to different app because of limited transaction record of daily limyy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I am frustrated I cannot edit a friends name in my contact list. I entered it wrong. Otherwise would give more stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely confused us. None of the totals added up, so I ended up spending the whole flight home working out the groups finances!!! Not impressed 😕"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but doesn't allow you to do much anymore, will be switching to a different app which offers more value"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for a long time, and while it served me well - their new marketing strategy is disgusting. You're limited to how many expenses you can add per day for a group. If you're rarely needing to settle debts, you won't feel the change, but if you're running a household with roommates - it becomes very painful. I'm considering developing an open-source competitor with the same capabilities out of spite, that's how mad I am at this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy-to-use,.very helpful tracking expenses and balances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app, but the change to limit expenses per day to three is absolute garbage, the pro version is way too expensive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paywalling a simple feature of adding more than three expenses a day is terrible for your customers. Very disappointed as a long time user and will be looking for an alternate expenses app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This application doesn't allow me to set up experiences more then 3 times per day. It is very inconvenient. So please 🙏 chenge it. Set up to 10."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice that it has a web interface for desktop too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Cannot go wrong with this app. Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What the hell is expense limit? I could add as many expenses as possible and now there's a limit on that? What kind of nonsense you're pushing behind the paywall"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Simplify feature is worst. It includes people with whom we have settled up if we update something in group. It should be atleast excluding these people with whom we are not sharing any expenses even being in group. It is increasing the repayment to multiple people instead of decreasing it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Me and my friends were happy users and advocates of this app, but the 3 expenses per day limit on the free version is just ridiculous, and makes the app useless for any use case you might have. The decision to move existing features to the pro version and increase the pro version prices is going to kill and otherwise great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app I ever used."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app now really pushes you to pay for the pro version 👎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"not working from past 3hrs, even after pro subscription payment has been made."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limited to 3 entries"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but the new pricing model is trash. I'd happily pay a fixed amount per trip, but I'm not going to subscribe to some plan for an app that I'm not using for most of the year. Sadly it seems like I'll have to look for an alternative app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Added limit to number of expenses, we are moving to a different app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Since the last update, the free app has been severely stripped down by limiting the input of expenses to 3 per day. Even if this was a reasonable limit, users are forced to sit through a 10 second ad to upgrade to Splitwise Pro... for each and everyone of their precious 3 allotted inputs. After having been utilized by users for years, paywalling a core feature of your app and parading it as a ""benefit"" of the Pro version is not any way to induce existing users to pay your subscription fees."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely bad app, they ask you to pay for the premium version or other way you need to wait till next day to keep adding expenses, download ""settle up"" app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was a big fan of this app. I can understand that the developers try to create features, the user want/need to pay for. But decreasing the expenses per day to only 3 is totally destroying the app for free use. It's like forcing people to pay, is that the right way to make people use the pro version? I guess you need to implement creative features, that makes the user want to pay. But forcing them with reducing this fundamental feature to the minimum is the worst you can do to your community."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for years until they introduced a limit on how many expenses you can add in a day to force you to pay for the Pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do I, an android user, get told i need to subscribe to add more than 3 items a day, but my partner on ios doesn't? As if this app justifies a subscription model, you absolute chancers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Works pretty well, but a glaring flaw is that it assumes the email you use for Splitwise is also going to be what you use for Paypal or Venmo. Users should be asked explicitly if they want to enter Paypal or Venmo details before Splitwise even allows you to send money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I am using your App. I just notice a draw back in your App. We made a group and add expenses. If a member pays to someone else to settle up then there is also a delete option visible to me to delete that transaction. The delete option should only be available to those who added the transaction. Otherwise, someone will delete someone's transaction and this will be a problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shameful decision to limit up to 3 transactions a day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous pricing. Now they added 3 expenses/day limit. Why not just introduce ads ? Instead, you try to annoy people into buying premium (which most people won't do btw). A lot of people just use this app to keep track of hanging out expenses between friends. Do you actually think those kinds of users will pay a MONTHLY fee just for that ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just 3 expenses in daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding Expenses is a Pro feature Now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awesome app until the last update. They ibcluded a paywall limiting the amount of daily expenses to be added to 3 (yeah, 3) and after that the app is basically useless unless you pay. Veyñry very very bad decision from the management and product owner. I'll find an alternative becuase I'm not paying when I only use splitwise 3 or 4 t8mes per year when I go into holidays with my friends. WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT DECISION?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was the best of it's kind until they forced you to get premium by limiting the number of expenses you can register to 3 per day. I will get a different app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be the best app. Not anymore! Who's gonna wait for another day to add more expenses? And daily limit is 3. I mean... ARE YOU EVEN KIDDING? Happy to find an alternative than upgrading to pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You need to pay for premium to enter multiple transactions.... what a scam"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was a wonderful app. But the app is not opening right now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App banks on hidding venmo option for settling. They want you to use plaid which collects sells all your banking transactions, just to withdraw (with no options to reverse transaction to choose other options like venmo)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is a daily limit for expenses. Go for split money. It's better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not allowing to add expenses. Asking to get pro everytime"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app works great! A must have when traveling with a group. Easy to use and helpful in coordinating costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Now they are forcing u to buy splitwise pro . Thats 50$s so bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Limits users with daily quota on how many times one can add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"On adding a new expense it is asking me to go for pro version. Can you please fix this ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best ever app to manage and track expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!!! Makes traveling with friends so much easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I owe my family so much money 10/10"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for splitting costs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Basic version is just allowing 3 spends update and pro version is extremely costly for such an app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What is the use of this app when it doesn't let you add more than 3 spends per day. Better choose other alternatives as there are tons of apps better than this. Devs greed is visible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Flawless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Not added more expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Terrible UX. It shouldn't be so hard to create a group in an app in 2023. Some terminology also doesn't make sense. For eg, when splitting in a group under split equally, adding a new memeber doesn't automatically split the cost with them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add 3 expenses without getting blocked by a paywall. What a dumb greedy move by developers. Good luck keeping customers now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for a very long time and it was doing a wonderful job. I even signed up for the Pro version and, when I saw the quality of what I got, I cancelled it immediately. Now they've introduced daily expense limit to the free version, and it's 3!! Meaning, you can only add 3 expenses per day, that's it!! If this doesn't change, I'll be leaving the app pretty soon. There are other apps that do the same job (if not a better one, even) for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is crashing unable to start"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is asking for pro subscription for the basic feature. I just created a group and added three expenses and asking for pro by restricting add new expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was free until it wasn't. Free version is essentially useless now as SW now has a extremely low daily limit for expenses and won't allow user to added any more expenses unless they upgrade to the Pro version. Shutting free users to force everyone to pay is a dumb strategy. I'll be looking for alternate platforms instead or just rely on a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Almost all free usage is restricted, getting very irritating to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was brilliant but now they restrict to 3 expenses per day which is rediculous. Will be looking for an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Much helpful for bachelors"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit to number of expenses that can be added? And that too like 4 expenses only. Are you guys serious??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is crashing most of the time in vivo t2 pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful application in deed. But the 3 expenses daily limit brings it down. Request the developers to re consider. Can anyone suggest a similar application?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Noice!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No-one seems to be talking about the fact that on the standard version you can only add 3 expenses a day. Any more than that and you have to upgrade to the Pro version. Fine - but let's be upfront about it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best in class!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recent update that added a paywall just to add an expense(limiting the amount of expenses a person can add) is ridiculous and makes the free version useless. Very disappointed that this is the route devs went with instead of something else. A paid subscription can be made more enticing by offering discounts or adding features not by blocking a basic functionality behind a paywall. Hope this gets fixed or else I'd be adding an alternative app name here for anyone else facing the same issue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Subscription trap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Tried to purchase pro version but the payment just don't go thru."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The lady and I used splitwise for years to settle our expenses, it was awesome. Added paywall for basic features? No thanks, gonna look elsewhere"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Useful but clunky website. Why restrict amount/ value of expenses per day?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"THE DAILY LIMIT OF JUST 3 EXPENSES IS THE WORST. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pay to use app, not usable without subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Several years ago this app was great, however, it now requires a paid SUBSCRIPTION to be able to add more than a few bills in one day. With such a core feature now behind a paywall, this is not usable as a free app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to split money for group trip. Huge respect for developers 💕. Also give trial for new user to use pro features so they shall know the best use of app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the new update limits you to entering 3 expenses per day, which makes the app practically unusable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Have been using Splitwise for years but now they are just looking for money and not customer satisfaction. After adding just 2 expenses for a day they are now requesting to take premium to add more expenses. This is so annoying and frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for trip and family expense management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be free to use. Now I can only enter 3 expenses a day to split, or otherwise I need to pay for premium?!?!? Give me a break. What a joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not letting make payment via paypal"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, long term usage. Recent update is pushing to get pro after I made 4 entries for the day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is unusable since the new update. Now there is a daily and weekly limit for how much expenses you can create. This means vacation trips, with lots of small seperate costs are no longer easy to divide over everyone. This feature used to be free but now we have to pay for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm going to create my own fokin' app without restrictions but thanks to give the courage to create my own services"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is my favorite app and I've been sharing this app to everyone. Recently they became such a money grabber and made almost every aspect of the free app premium.. when I finally decided that I shall contribute and pay the premium.. they doubled the cost.. this is crazy.. if anyone has any good alternatives, please let me know. Definitely need to jump ship."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Me and my friends are always using it, for years now. It does a really good job."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Could be used only for paid service not for free usage. Very worst app, going to uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App was really helpful and it relieved lot of confusion between bills only problem is with the pro version...I'm not saying to give for free but can reduce the amount atleast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So for the group expense i didn't like this app at all i found an Another app ""kharchless"" which is very much better application for managing group expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Too good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently the app is very disturbing... many times I couldn't open app itself. App is closing itself with Splitwise runtime exception. Worst app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I installed but can't even open..keeps crashing..and says update to latest version...lol what a failure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Money draining app.. avoid if possible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please just sell/get bought out by venmo, so that we have a better more seamless experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was recommending this to all of my friends. But the recent update make me only add 3 expense, just 3 expense and for adding next one they are asking money🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hard to use, not really a smart app to split between people if not everyone is in the group when you add your expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introduced exceptionally low allowable limit on free version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's removed all headache of hisab kitab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was nice before daily limits were set to force you to buy premium. Used forever to track and split household expenses. Will need to search for a new app now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for years now and it works great. The only thing I don't like is that functionally that was free keeps getting put behind a pay wall (e.g. attaching images via mobile costs while via PC is free)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If you have the free version they now limit the amount of transactions you can enter per day to only 3... absolutely ridiculous and I will not be recommending this app to anyone I know anymore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gud app to split expenses on the go.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"V good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Daily limit without paying for Pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why I am unable to add more than 3 expenses per day and asking to go for splitwise pro now a days, which was not asking 2 days before? Very disappointed with this feature. I am planning to uninstall this app if they don't change this feature."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app, been using it for years. Helpful for group trips, big orders of stuff, team fees, etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise pro was introduced, we can't use split wise with out paying money. So don't use this app, search for other alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saves a lengthy spreadsheet 👍🏼👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No way to delete old groups or hide them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to see expenses added by other members of group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It is very helpful in tracking group expense but can inorder to track personal expense against a fixed budget there's no option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst with your daily limitations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is crashing all the time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst application ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Got a limit in spending per day in the free version. Never had this before. This is steal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until they are limiting the number of expenses you can put per day to 3 unless you pay. Corporate greed once again ruining great things"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but the new daily expense limit of 3 expenses makes it unusable. I'd be happy to pay for it, but it is so expensive for what it is. And the subscription model is annoying, it should be a one-off payment for life"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good app but , I jst put 4 expenses and app asking me for subscription..without subscription app is not working for my 5th expense and onwards."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly they put limit on 5 expenses a day. Forcing to buy pro version. New users if you want to add more than that keep in mind to purchase pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent. big headache solves"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only allowed to put 1 expense a day, this makes the app useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was such a nice app but now it allows only 3 transactions to be added and later asks for buying pro which rendered the basic app useless. Planning to uninstall it and find some replacement if this pro popup goes like this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the app.. Made it all easy.. Lesser burden at the end of any trip.. Highly recommended.. Best wishes for the team.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow! This is a great app. So easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Free daily limit ridiculously low. It would be more transparent to just charge for the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise is great, but we need more control in groups: 1. Add expense deletion permissions. 2. Create an audit trail for transparency. 3. Give users privacy settings. 4. Enable group policy management. These improvements would make Splitwise even better for managing group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"only 3 expense can be added in one day are you guys crazy.. people will go back to excel again .. no one will pay for this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Buggy, problematic. Settle up people are messed up, whenever transactions are added persons to be paid change, which differ from the accounts that originally added the expenses. Decimal fractions are off. Its always 1-2 cents that remain to be settled. Expect much more from a budget/expese settling app. It should be very precise. Shouldn't be that hard to apply basic math formulas."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is supposed to help with simplifing payments, it has made the lives worse.... cannot even equally distribute and calculate the payments... stupid app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used to love it until they put a paywall (daily limit) since the last update so you have to buy the pro version. 0/5"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a nice app. Easily we can segregate our expenses. Good tracking on our expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for use while making plans of travel with friend. A must use app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very useful app. But starting past week it won't open and constantly crash."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This ask for personal details like mobile number etc. NOT SECURE AT ALL"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise has been a game-changer for managing shared expenses with friends and family. It simplifies the process of splitting bills and keeps everyone on the same page. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to add expenses and settle up, and the real-time balance updates are incredibly helpful. I also appreciate the option to include notes and receipts. It's a must-have app for anyone who shares expenses, and it has made my life so much easier!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is eating up all my battery. 12 mins usage is taking up almost 3%! Please fix. Edit: As a Pro user, would love to import/auto read my transaction SMS's."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's better to rename ""You owe"" in the spendings list to ""Your share"". It was misleading for my mate, as he objected to the number (as he understood it as him owing me, not him owing a share to pay). Besides, owes only make sense at the very end, when debts are getting settled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Cool idea, especially for trips but after only 3 inputs you are required to purchase the pro version. This makes the app unusable without paying which would be fine to begin with but don't lure people in like that with a ""free"" app and adds."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for expenditure management for buddies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Used for many trips and even for budgeting with the boyfriend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"All is well 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for distribution"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an amazing app!!! 👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, very recommended, useful if you are on trip with friends, good if you are living outside with friends. Very easy , proper money management. 5/5 star ⭐⭐✨⭐⭐, thank you splitwise for saving my time and 💰 money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Hi Need help in updating a refund entry. Not able to update the same as credit. The amount is getting added up to the total. Kindly advise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to use it, getting crashed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"one of the best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Weffc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Simple and great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can be described by one word. Amazing 👏 I think the app should not show all your friends when you open the app. It should be showing only those have balances between you and them. Because I have too many contacts have the app and it is annoying to keep looking between 50 name while 30 of them has no balance Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is not getting opened in my phone. It's getting crashed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"K i k bhi to 8+!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"great for group travel! I hate doing the math to split things and this app does all the work for you. will definitely recommend to all of my friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good app , but daily limit to add only 3 expense is too bad.. not expected that"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable since they introduced a limit to add 4 only transactions per day. No way i'm paying the overpriced pro for features i dont need"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"need splitwise pto for currencies and scanning receipts. base app next to useless. Pro app expensive for occasional use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app, extremely helpful for family and friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best Split App ever,cheers to the App Development Team. Hoping for payment gateway option for easy settling up the money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"We absolutely adore the Splitwise app – it's become an integral part of our daily lives. Its convenience and functionality have truly enhanced our financial management. However, we'd like to offer a constructive suggestion to make it even more user-friendly. We occasionally struggle to locate past expenses for referencing or editing. It would greatly improve the app's usability if a search button were added to simplify this process. Keep up the great work!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Advertisement is not good for this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Solid app. Thanks for creating this very useful app. Kudos to the developers!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is a good app but now it's forcing me to take premium. I can only post three transactions a day. I will soon gonna uninstall it and find a replacement for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application to keep track of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Only two entry is allowed pathetic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Going kolkota for a fellowship"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for maintaining split expenses Very simple and easy to use Everyone must download the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A must have! Well built and easy to use :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible for sending and receiving money. Sure it does a great job of totalling up expenses, but so does a calculator. When it comes to the important part, sending and receiving money, it is terrible. Pulling money from this thing is not intuitive and it forces you to give up a bunch of private info in order to do so. I used it once, and I'll never use it again. Edit: I changed my review to one star because it takes way to long to get your money from this poorly designed app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Day one installation show's your daily usage limit exceeded. Not user friendly. Extremely disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I am overall satisfied with the app but there are some suggestions which i would like to give , it should also show me my personal expenses in every group i made in the app ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helps is neatly splitting expenses, especially the simplify debt option. Even complex expenses can be added and split easily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Waste, irritating and can't pay directly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to manage trip expenses and sharing them amongst participants."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was perfect until they restricted adding images to expenses which wasn't restricted before Prev: Excellent app, simplicity and efficiency are what defines it. Shotout to developers and UX designers. Allow adding images!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Hood. The totals could be a free feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great expense management app when you need to share your expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can oly add 3 expense a day for non premium"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful, best, easier to use, love it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Went on a trip with 8 friends and it made short work of figuring out who owed what so we could all settle up with the least amount of transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst Experience. Kindly work on simplicity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Again and again new pro add come and I can not add my expenses because they are not allowing me to add expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Went from 5 stars for years suddenly to 1 star. Now can't do anything without ads and now daily limits on interactions without exorbitant monthly subscription. Shame what's happened to a good app. Will uninstall and get a different app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is not the most easy to use ... they block you after 5 five expense entered per day because they want you to pay for the pro -_-"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"More curency options shud be there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is so confusing... I paid double the expenses since I started using this app. The app showes that I own friend A $10.48 for the event XY, I send an e-transfer to friend A, then the app shows that I owe $10.48 for the same event to Fiend B... I just sent the money to friend A... what is this?!... Now I have to send another $10.48 to friend B... Do yourself a favor and don't get bother with this trash. I'm a professional UX/UI Designer and this app is one of the worst I ever used..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful for group trips or couples expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good idea, but if you have Monzo or anything similar that is much better"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add attachments without getting pro"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Couldn't have been any better. Its more than perfect. Very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Can we have feature of copying and re-adding an old expense again which usually re-occurs at random intervals."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is great at what it does. So great that me and my friends went on a trip, one of my friends uses it and suggested to keep track of the trip expenses and we installed it on our phones. Another one of my friends got so hooked up with the app that he kept using it for every single expense and also kept forcing us to use it. Almost ruined the trip. We still give him a hard time whenever we plan any trips or have any occasion where splitting even our expenses. Great job, Splitwise. Love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good application managing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So this is actually a fantastic app. Sign up/Creating a group/UI all were fantastic. The one stickler is the most important feature for international, currency conversion, is behind the monthly subscription. But thats only 3$ so Im hinestly fine with it. 100% reccommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible corporate greed. Good luck with your premium customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is a great app but you can't restrict the base functionality of the app to a pro subscription. There is a limit to the number of expenses that can be added now! That is just ridiculous considering that is the only use of this app. People who don't want to pay will just switch to another app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to monitor expenses while on holiday!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a seamless experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is a blessing when we go on trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Was very happy that I could add friends from website without inviting them. But, sadly I can no more add without phone no or email. That's really bad. I don't want to intimate my friends about my entries. I'm done with splitwise for the same reason. Looking for alternatives now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply the best. Easy to track. Variety of money split category!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I currently use a customized Excel sheet. I heard about this app by recommendation. I wanted to test it out by using existing settled expenses to compare it with my spreadsheet but the free version would not allow me to add more than 3 expenses per day and I do not have time to get to it 3 by 3 until it catches up with the whole month. I do not want to pay for something that I have already built a spreadsheet for just to test if I like it. It worked ok I guess."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't provided full details. Automatically splits and adjusts the amount without information."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payment options suck"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for flatmates, roommates and friends trip for managing your expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"La mejor opcion para tener un control de gastos entre amigos y parejas"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I just used it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for managing expenses among friends. Also, They provide quick response whenever I contact them for some queries or errors."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When ever I plan to purchase Pro- it show 45/month or 499/year but while payment I get otp for 5000Rs INR to pay for both monthly or yearly?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"A very laggy and jittery app. Otherwise deserves 5."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"We have to buy premium version after few usage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good features for free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"logging and settling shared expenses with other people has become SO easy with Splitwise. To make it even better, both the app and the website work incredibly well. 10/10 will keep using"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful. I used to use this every day for expense sharing, but with the newest update if you don't pay for it now they limit you to like 5 daily transactions and make you wait through a 10-second timer to add each one. Will not be using this any more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great for occasional group expenses. It gets confusing when there are ALOT of group expenses split (for example, splitting costs with roommates on an apartment for supplies, food, electricity etc.) since there isn't a breakdown where your total is coming from. So you have to blindly trust the math and send the money. It does it's job well but if you want a complete breakdown on what expenses give you the total amount u need to transfer someone, an Excel sheet might be a better option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall it is great. The ONE AND ONLY thing I would like is to be able to set a DEFAULT currency to enter the expenses with the ability to enter expenses in other currencies as well (which already exists)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great Product"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No integrated payment gateways like UPIs, makes this app inconvenience app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"super useful app, no ads even without pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App should not advertise for split wise pro much. App must make unlimited expenses noting without splitwise pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's a good idea app but the UI doesn't seem to be user friendly and I think it did wrong calculation among group members. When one member add new expenses which some of the group didn't invole, it does reduce the among money that they own another person. So confusing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app I always wanted for social occasions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome design and feel, fantastic features even in non-pro version, good job developers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This application my office official expense entry site, now camera option is removed I don't know why"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They started paywalling previously free features. Time to find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely WORTHLESS and took my money and messed up all my accounts! I hate apps and I HATE THIS APP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its an amazing app with best in class user experience. Even without premium subscription there are no ads in app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to avoid clashes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Worth using when group of people travel together. It counts so well . I m gonna use this all the time when group of people spend together"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This version has some problems .. after making a group and adding people to it.. the group stops showing in my app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This idea of Splitwise is fantastic in itself. Keep it up you guys. Cheers"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I use Splitwise whenever I'm on a holiday with more than a couple of other people and it simplifies things so much, but I really wish there was an option for a one off payment to get pro features in a single group. I only use it once or maybe twice a year, so a subscription just doesn't make sense. That said, I'd like to support the devs and some features like currency conversion would be great to have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used this app for years and now they've paywalled the use of receipts unless you pay the subscription. The app is pretty useless without receipts, so why bother? It was good while it lasted. Too bad."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What a great idea for group trips and a must-have, which keeps all the shared spending, fair and square!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"You just no need to be calculate in the mind or in the calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great in calculating group spent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Melhor aplicativo para casais dividirem suas contas. Excelente! Recomendo"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Excessively complicated. Useless interface. Learning curve is required in a simple settlements app. Laughable feature restrictions in free version make it completely useless. Requires a lot of information from all the participants of a settlement. 1 star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hi! Can you add calculator function when typing in Amount. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be great but they remove the ability to add pics and require you to pay for the pro version for you to be able to upload/attach receipts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Bye,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very confusing to set up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are now showing 10s ads just to add an expense. So much greed for such a simple app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loving app... best working for group splitting money... 👌💪"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great before but now it's not even letting me add a single image to my bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App! Thanks.. loved the ""optimise"" payments option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I didn't like you guys removed the feature of adding pictures in normal version !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"At least bill upload features must be included in free version.. I don't say u don't charge but this is a must these days in competitive age"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great App for organizing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wow, you guys just made attaching pictures a Pro feature now? For that ridiculous price? Good job 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is very good. The worst feature in the last update is that they added the to upgrade it to the pro version to know about the group totals... It has the wors thing...kindly use special features for the pro version.. Either we will uninstall the app from our phone. I've using it for 5years consecutively. Why u've added group totals in the pro..???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Old groups screw up the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not a very convenient app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app Not adding me in split wise not responding through email"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was good but recently they removed the option to add reciept / image they added it on the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for keeping track of expenses in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is great and helpful tool to split all the trip expenses with very easy filling and distribution of expenses at end of trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"There should be a description for the complete balance that one owes the other person so that details can be cross checked"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We used to use Fuse before it shut down, then went with nothing for a while. Finally came across Splitwise and my roommates and I absolutely love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to share expenses among us. Thanks to the developers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent and breezy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Friends used it for splitting expenses in their apartment. I moved into a place with them. Saw that they had no issue, with free account, posting hundreds of expenses since we like to leave people the opportunity to opt out of using individual items. I paid for one of the grocery trips, tried to start posting expenses......only 5 allowed per week before i hit a ""weekly expense limit"" and being told to get pro version.....bro this is GIGAcringe lmao all my friends can post unlimited expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It tries to minimize the number of transactions by tallying the amount between multiple people, but it would be really helpful if it explains it somehow, like who owes who how much exactly and what the app did to really the numbers. It's confusing to see the optimizations sometimes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am using this application from a long time, but now it is making simple calculations very difficult. This app is not splitting the amount correctly. This app can be useful for 2 people but not for more then 2 people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app , easy to use and saves lot of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Literally the best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great Application for expense record. Thank you splitwise team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for transactions between friends. It would be great if we had the option to add a balance transfer instead of adding a transaction when one person transfers some amount to another."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good Application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A fantastic app for sharing expenses. A real saviour. Very easy and no brainer to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Accurate, reliable, very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rather than selling the pro subscription with features and value adds, they instead resort to wait timers like one of those scamny file download websites. Also £27.99 per year is way too expensive for an app that just essentially tracks a number."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A small but great addition to my life after being introduced to it by friends. One problem is remembering to put a bill on especially on a boozy night but also at meals. My solution is at the start to create a transaction for 0.01 and even add a photo of the place or menu say. I have also used it when borrowing cash from a mate. I am not sure of the business model and costs but I would not pay the current price for pro but would pay a small annual amount for basic but then all would have to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splits are all over the place with incorrect values on splits"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Τρομερό"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed to now have a daily limit of how many expenses can be added in the free version, with apparently no warning that this was coming. This essentially makes the free version unusable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for a while. It's been extremely useful. Takes away all the headache of keeping track of shared expenses. As it updates everyone instantly makes it so much better. Highly recommended app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Glitch in application..not showing the expense split properly.. check and solve the problem asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing tool for groups of 3+ to help keep track of expenses so that everyone is paid fairly. I'll recommend this app to all my friends (and have done!)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"very faulty calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using it for 4 years now! Thanks for all the great works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable able to accept payments using app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Works great but the app autmomaticly gives a PayPal to pay yiur friends with. This PayPal is not correct nad have had people send money to rand people's PayPal becouse of the automatic setup of the PayPal, don't recomend this app as you can easily loose Monday that benafit no one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very uselful app, fast, good calculations!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Tricount is a much better app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update doesn't even allow to add image or file without purchasing a premium plan. That's completely ridiculous!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'd give it a zero star rating. Stop advertising it as free when I literally have to get the pro version just to upload my receipt, other pro features are justified but the receipt thing crossed the line"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App for managing and recording daily life expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Too rigid requirements to share info on members"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good to see and calculations wise 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cant upload images now unless I buy their pro!! Greedy people!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"GENIUS APP and easy to use. I love how helpful it is, especially for those of us numerically challenged lol"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Great app ruined by paywall for uploading receipt images. The free version had it before which now got moved to the pro version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"EXTREMELY HAPPY FROM THIS APP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful, practical and has a clean, easy interface. I just wish you could add expenses with someone without inviting them to use the app. Sometimes I just want to do personal debt tracking without bothering people with SMS invites to download the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"First it used to be a handy app, but thinking to uninstall it and find other alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such an awesome experience. Very easy to track all expenses at one place and great thing is exact calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They have introduced a weekly expense limit without any kind of notice beforehand, affecting existing groups as well. This effectively makes this app useless, since, for example, in a vacation group, you have more than 5 expenses per week. I sincerely hope they're gonna undo this outrageous update. If they do, then my review will be updated to 5 stars, since it was a very solid app until now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"expense tracking is really hard and complicated. who paid, who owes to whom, it's really a mess"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Fancier copy of tricount, works well but with paywalls behind some of the functions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome awesome app , made our college life so much easier..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An unique app which is used by me and my friends to settle any expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good medium to simplify expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It always saying your amount is settled up..useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The most complicated app and in app navigation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful application. I am happy for each day I use it. It makes it easier to split or only track expenses on your trip, with family or colleagues at work for ordering lunch."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Highly Disappointed have been using it for 4 years, all of a sudden attaching recipets as a free option is now removed & made as a paid feature. Nothing useful now such a cheap tactics"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for group trip expenses calculation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Introducing a paywall without notice, making app non-functional I had been using splitwise for years and was a big fan - until without notice they introduced a paywall limiting the amount of expenses you can submit per day. I can understand adverts before submitting each expense for a free version (even if this is very annoying!), but limiting the amount of expenses makes the free app basically useless for large groups and has put my in awkward positions having to re-explain money owed :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely greedy Devs, used the app fine for two years and used to post pictures to transactions, now they made this free feature a premium feature just to add your own picture to a transaction, I AM NOT GOING TO PAY MONTHLY JUST TO ADD A PICTURE. WILL BE FINDING A FREE APP OR JUST USE EXCEL."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to track expenses for group and individuals."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Receipt Image Upload has been paywalled with latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"If there's a option to maintain our own expenses it would be better. Other than that it the best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just started and apparently reached the weekly limit??? No idea how much pro version is until you proceed to buy! Don't like this rubbish might return to a spreadsheet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, and I would actually get the pro version if it didn't require a subscription. Make it a reasonably priced one-time payment and I'll likely get it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the good app. There is another app named ""iSpent"" which is very user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Inconsistent when loading information. I deleted the app and installed it to be sure it wasn't a bug, but somehow, it still keeps adding random people to a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Went to Vietnam with friends. Splitwise has a 'simplify debts' option that allowed my group to split the overall cost of the trip evenly, despite us all spending different amounts over the course of the trip. The app literally simplifies debts by doing all the complex calculations for everyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't see the point in taking Splitwise premium, Can't see a single noticeable difference"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it, I highly recommend this app for all share expenses among friends, between couples, etc., It's been so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stop spamming ""Turn on simplify debt"" message"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! Up until recently I really liked this app, but the scumbags have paywalled a previously free feature (literally just adding a single photo of your receipt) to try and force you into a subscription. I could understand paywalling new features to encourage subscriptions, but the Devs are too lazy and would rather punish a loyal user base. Disgusting behaviour."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Taking away functions originally available in the free version is BS, especially when numerous apps provide the same functions for free. 👋💨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the bill image feature was really good. now they have made it a pro feature. i think i should switch to other apps."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and user friendly. Please add search feature in expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app sort out spends in shared rooms and trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App experience is getting bad on each update. Now we even can't see the total expenditure of the group and even of me as well. For seeing total expenditure, we have to buy the subscription? Really? And subscription is also monthly / yearly? Even an excel can provide the total expenditure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The OG app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot remove activities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app, helping to manage expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app is very useful for expense calculation. Currently, the only major disadvantage is to settle the expense via the app, which is not there as the only payment app available Paytm has been disabled. So currently we can't settle it via the app. Please introduce more payment options via other payment apps to settle the expenses. Otherwise the app is really good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful for group trips away. Literally the app I'd been looking for for years!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really helpful! Simple and powerful. Thanks splitwise team & keep improving!! Would be great if we have rounding feature and history per group, not for all (easier to search)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group trip 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great aap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente para distribuir y anotar los montos de los viajes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Actual calculations are different than the shown in the applications. When you add expenses to split between 3 people it does show for that particular transaction, but in summary it is showing only for 2. One person is ending up paying 66% most of the time. Just to add in--- I have validated the transaction and all are in single currency and all members are involved with equal contribution, so ideally expenses should come 33% each which is not happening."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Es muy fácil de usar y muy útil cuando viajas con tus amigos, la versión gratuita está muy completa."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Does not show the math of how it arrives at the final sums or clearly explains the results. Can't trust the app if the math is not transparent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Greedy Devs made basic options pro features ! I've been using splitwise for years (from a different account until recently) and I used to recommend it to friends. Now, after the update they made a basic feature - ability to upload a photo alongside a bill, a pro feature! This was a very basic yet useful feature which was quite handy to double check that the right expense was being entered in to splitwise bills. Now I can't do that anymore unless I pay for it!! I'm never gonna do that, ever!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They added a paywall to add images/receipts to expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Losing function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Having a good exp."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's a mess, and for some disturbing reason it wants to know your friends' email addresses. You can do much more clearer, flexible, and discrete with a simple Google Sheet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can improve a lotttt. User experience not up to the mark. Example on click of 'X owes you Y' doesn't show breakup of total owes and just takes to group page. Premium features are very basic. Graphs are very basic doesn't add much value."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing application. Runs smoothly, clear handling and information with 100% privacy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very very complicated app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pointless using this app if you can't upload an image / receipt against a cost. What a disappointment with this change"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best way to keep track of who paid for what!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is a bug in the app, the actual Calculation is different from the calculation shown in the app. The Development team should look into the source code and do the needful. Because the app can't be relied on, especially when there is money transaction involved."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome App👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Very usefull, easy to use, and has great features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saves me from doing so much maths."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect for splitting bills between friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sh* app. Lets me only add my expenses, so what???? Complicated. So far it's for nothing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Docked a star because it only works with monetary values and doesn't have the option of adding intangible benefits. It also doesn't allow you to set interest rates which is a big missed opportunity to empower certain groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"सबसे घटिया Applications है...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't scan the bill in the free version anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Incredibly useful for trips with friends and simplifies cost tracking. Nice UI, UX and intuitive layout as well"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointing that the debtors can't see itemised debts. You end up having to send it to them in WhatsApp and ultimately just use your own banking app. This app sounds great but is fairly pointless, lots of ways to do this already."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👍👌🏻 it calculates every payment made by u n other PPL n gives exact calculated amount to be paid by each one aftr all calculations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's an awesome app for trip among friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and Accurate!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for bill splitting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is a big in the app worst experience please don't use it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise changed my life!! I just wish it had a way to itemize expenses on the app, like it does on the browser."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am not able to see the entire group history like before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Una excelente opción para planificar y organizar gastos en un viaje, ayudando a mantener cuentas claras y amistades largas, super recomendado"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing and very simple and easy to understand, split expenses between friends or relatives while you on trip record small to little exense either party makes and application itself shows who owes whom how much..amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app! Does everything I want and more. Also, no ads :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application useful for trips and all so useful and accurate division of expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Haahahah"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome little simple app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's so convienent to use it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great spp use it split bills between friends, easy to use. Free features are just enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app I have used for my expenses. It's would be more better if I can add my own expense in different tab. But overall I loved it... Well Done Team Splitwise💪💪💪"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is crashing everytime I opens it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good and convenient. Please include a calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Overall good app for friends who pay for each others..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App works well except for one issue where it will not adjust the share when you add a new member to the group. So basically you have to have all members in teh group before adding expenses. This is a major flaw of what could be a great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Deixando de usar porque retiraram a opção de ver o total mensal da versão gratuita. Uma pena."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Whenever we export monthly expenses as spreadsheet , it including previous month history also. Add a feature where we can export only for that particular month or after all settled expenses.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Overall it's useful and good app - It will be better if the expenses are shown without entering to a particular one and an option to make a default currency. I'm tired of selecting INR everytime."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Best app to keep track of your expenses and equal payups pf your group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great App. It should introduce UPI Apps for Indian users for settlements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Functionality is superb!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love the ease it provides my life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for tracking expenses in group, using this for 6 years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good but how can we delete single contact from already created group?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app that removes confusion of expenses among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for tracking the spending."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful. Especially for family trips and trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is worst to not display total for non pro users.I think that is basic functionality to see total group expenses and individual expenses.Making it as pro functionality make me to think for another app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app for bacholers and roomates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app is good for maintaining the gang tours budgets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"At least you have to give a cash back points to your users so that they can use this app with some hope any gift voucher or a little amount of cash back for using this app is a great initiative 👍🏻👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't able to add image before it was but now they are charging for that. So disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add people without sending them an invitation (I just wanted to trial the app first). Can't enter future expenses; must enter an amount that has been paid (in my case, nothing has been paid yet)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"There's no ads in free version also."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is trash. There is no granular way to edit expenses for each person as a trip admin."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If it provide the option to select to download only particular month report is better Rather downloading whole months automatically While exporting the report. .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Helpfup, Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great for keeping track of who owes money in a group but could go further. 2 x enhancements would be: 1) if currency (and therefore total) is changed, all splits would automatically be linked to the exchange rate and change, rather than having to calculate each one. 2) linking a bank account to each member for auto settle up would be fab."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unnecessary need to create a login and give participants email or phone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Too good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The 1% say they love it for their criminal activities. Straight from the mouth of pigs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is confusing as hell, keeps asking me to upgrade to splitwise pro. I guess paying money forever is easier than using a calculator for some people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful to take notes for all the expenditure related to any trips among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"We paid each other with zelle and that wasn't an option on the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made bill payment sharing on trip super easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great ap for group hangout and keeping track of group spendings! Been using for 5 years, always helps in keeping track of group spendings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good concept. But there must be an option track ourself expenses. We can not track expenses which I've entered and didn't split with anyone. - when we modify any entry, there should be only new entry. As of now it is showing both old and new entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise took a week to get me my money when somebody accidentally used it to pay me. Boo this app. Go use Venmo or PayPal or Google Pay or Zelle or Cash app instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for splitting costs. So easy to use and rhe basic function is incredible. Thinking of upgrading because it's so good and the extra features seem worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to share expanses with friends and colleagues. Hope sattling option appears in Ukraine."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Technically works fine but split wise pay is terrible I am using this app for quite sometime, we have all the split options, however when it comes to splitwise pay, it's horrible, not sure why it takes a week time to transfer money, that's something I hate to use in this application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to premium Till recent updates it was allow to upload the receipt to every record but now they remove the upload picture options, and available for pro only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, use it for every trip, gathering and household. The only missing feature is to quickly add an expense to a subgroup, like if in a trip for a section there is only part of the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Essential app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great Application for the group spending split. But i have a suggestion, if you guys can add monthly budget feature that will be great upgrad. And help user alot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great until settling up. Your amount you're owed changes depending on who pays who first. Odd. Plus side - you can crack some great puns when visiting Split, Croatia."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient. Does what it is supposed to do."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the best shared expenses management app out there. From daily flat expenses with roommates, to travel group expenses, Splitwise makes it easy to track and worry free."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No response once Logged into the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"പോളി അന്യായം.... ഈ മുത്തു മണിയെ ആണ് സുഹൃത്തുക്കളേ ഞാന്‍ നോക്കി നടന്നത് ഇനി ഒരുത്തനും എന്നെ പറ്റിക്കില്ല 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Latest update added already existing Free feature as premium. Height of greed when you ask for payment for not anything new but an already existing free image attachment capability in transactions. Disappointment as a long term user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Definitely one of the best apps I have ever used. We were on holiday with a group of nine friends, and this app made it a breeze to tally everything up, especially when you need to split stuff unevenly. The UI is nice and easy to use, and the adds are not shown, exect a gentile nudge to get the premium version I wholeheartedly recommend it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I like this so far as I generally pay for my daughter on my card when we are out and she pays me back. Dropped a star because I can't see a way to remove money owed from a specific debt when she ""settles up"" a partial amount. It only deducts from the total. Unless I'm missing something?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's good but at times keeps on freezing for a good period of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good useful app but I think there might be something wrong with the calculations after the latest update on Android. The total doesn't add up, when looking at the individual debts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I like this app, I dont like to pay for some extra things, but if you use it a lot, it can be worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome for trips. Its now a standars for my friend group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very bad app, jab sy install ki hi ghatay mn ja rha"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very smart application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a amazing app. Thanks. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great app , easy to split bills , easy to use :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to track the record of the small-small payments made in the whole day with the friends and that too in such a organised way"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"More than the use of the app, what I greatly appreciate about Splitwise is the responsive back end suppport."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👏👏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rubbish UI"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super duper app for friends & family to devide the expenses among themselves"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Increible aplicacion, resuelve muchos problemas de manera simple y rapida."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I like it, but It's hard to pay an expense. For example I have the money to pay for one expense, but when I want to settle for a person in just one expense it cannot be done"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app somehow makes it more confusing to settle expenses. Would give it 0 stars if I could"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Solid app, when sharing expenses btw group of people especially if not all expenses on the trip are shared btw everyone. I can't imagine doing that accounting without Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to manage the expense in group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for both small and big trips!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This App is ""Super Handy""!! 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"May you add validation in settling payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Few many days back (roommate's )we are all installed the above app.but one person my roomate ( kranthi ) create the fake excel. We are people loss the lot of money!!( 18 rupes )!!my roommates names rohith, ashok, kranthi, santossh 😔 we are people loss lot of money 🥳"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fabulous software"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using the free version, together with my girlfriend for almost a year now. The app does exactly what we need, I am so happy with it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely poor app design, there's an option to ""Simplify Debts"" but it gets very confusing and if you ever turn it off, even at net 0 when no one owes each other, everyone is stuck in a loop of paying everyone else in the group. For example if everyone owes each other $0 but you turn off Simplify Debts, I'll owe 6 people varying from $15-60 and they'll owe me the same amount. You then have to manually remove about 50 transactions. Awful, it's like it was coded by a student."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"That app allows to avoid payment split stress when you are enjoying your time with the friends Very recommended"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good idea but the interface isn't friendly, some features like ""simplify debts"" are constantly there and they're vague, infact it's better without it because it shows the same results anyway but with more explanation as to how the numbers were achieved, it just sucks that there's no way to remove that message where this feature is constantly pushed to be turned on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Various fixes and improvements? Lazy changelog? No love!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great! Easy. Free and NO ads. Used it for a group trip in Italy. Everyone loved it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, very useful for management of costs within groups of people, but it really needs a search function rather than having to trawl through all my transactions to find the one(s) I'm after, hence the lost star"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App doesn't open after latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Jabardast app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ux is not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Never worked for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Beta app for managing group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Add payment method pls"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App not working properly splitwise issues"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best in business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A good app to not to forget who owes how much and how much u owe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing.Very convenient. Very easy to operate even for a senior citizen like me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Fantastic idea, but the app just doesn't work very well. I bought the pro version to itemize a receipt, and the app just can't itemize anything; when you scan the receipt, it duplicates items, and then you can't delete or alter any of the items. I was able to log in on my computer and fix the list, but at this point, I might as well just use a Google spreadsheet instead. Also the price for the pro version is ridiculous, $30 per year or $3 per month? Maybe a one time purchase of $30, not yearly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great little app for monitoring group holiday expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: Please add a search and filter option in expenses to search and filter the expense on keywords basis. Rest I really like this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good Application. Helped me and my colleague to have a track on money spending and saves alot of time doing pen and notepad stuff."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"All ohkey..if you can add a calculator keyboard while adding amounts .. it will b more convenient to use .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect, change your logo and icon plz!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise should allow user to add group member without putting member's phone number / email. It will helps for many scenarios."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dont like the way they force you and your contact to sign up for new account bwfore being able to use the split function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app. Nothing beats this nd FREE OFCOURSE"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hi Splitwise, You're the best but I got an issue. When I add an expense to a group of 5 but I only highlight 3 of them, the app deducts from what I owe to another person I didn't highlight based on this expense I just added that he's not even involved in. Appreciate your feedback."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"happy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love to use this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Because Email is reqired"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's been a decade since you said you'd add this feature. PLEASE let us send reminders to everyone in a group at once."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unacceptable payment processing times. Do not use this apps built in payment feature. It takes 3-5 business days to process before it's even available to withdraw. What if you sent a roommate rent on the first? That money isn't available for another week. Absolute joke."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not for travel, IMHO. It works. But... 1. It re labeled all my friends with different names, not what I entered so I had to keep straight who was Fawn, who was Qwerty, etc. 2. It doesn't change anything back to home currency so I owed Fawn $X USD, $Y pesos and $Z CAD. So then you have to do your own calculations to get it all to one currency. What a PITA. Will find something else to use for travel if it involves more than 1 currency."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is exceptional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app which is useful to bachelor roommates to splite their expenditure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice, user friendly, useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app deserve 5 star. Free and solved all my group trip splitting expenses trouble"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"OVerall very good app however following points needs to be addressed: 1: There is only option to see group total for current month or previous month or total. However if i want to see total for a specific period, there is no option. 2. For groups, there should be admin option. Where one will be selected as admin, others can add expenses but will be approved by admin."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is a very nice and simple app. Love the UI. No unnecessary colors or too many widgets. A simple app to manage group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app sucks it's too hard to use, made the Tripp harder"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's the best app for travel expenses as well as for other bill records and splits."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app out there to manage the expense with a group!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There should be confirmatiom from the user on whether or not they want to join a certain group. Random people keep adding me in groups, and I cannot leave without settling up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for remembering what the hell you did"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When we try to create a group name, the app is getting closed immediately. Can you please check?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for managing spending on trips and even for daily use within families and friends outtings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Dear Splitwise, Please add ""Auto save"" to whiteboard, it's pain full to always click on save. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app for tracking expenses during travel"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Super easy to track who owes whom. Very intuitive. Ads are not annoying at all. Features are incredible, even without premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please allow the screen to turn on tablets!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good aps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lot of Bugs. Some other people are getting added despite not selecting them!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't support intergroup settlement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Need option for generate pdf"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please bring back Paytm integration. It was great to directly go to paytm and pay the amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When user settled account then other user should not post entry in back date on settlement users. Apps is good, calculation is perfect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't like this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app with great practicality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to use when going somewhere with friends and you wish to split the bills. You can all pay for certain things each, then add them to the app and it works out who has already paid the most and who owes who. We have used between 2 people, 4 and even 7 to work out the costs evenly. It's a great, essential app for these occasions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and very helpful in tracking expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App don't work on first start. No button work it hangs.I have to multiply time run this app then it works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for making counts. What it could've been a nightmare became so easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Vwry nice app to track the expenses during the trip or even regular expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Used for years for group trips, housesharing, family debts, always free is good enough if you don't care about exchange rates etc. Great fee splitting options, great interface, honestly all my friends now use it too. Wish it had the option to subtly nudge friends that forgot to pay you but you don't want to bother them, disguised as a normal push notification."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"use spliito, this app is bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It help very much to keep records on a trip of expenses suggest download before a ✈️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is really handy but Splitwise Pay is really slow. Use the app to figure out what each person owes but have everyone use Venmo or another payment service to settle up. Do not use the built-in Splitwise Pay payment service unless you want them to hold onto your money for an extra week or two"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm totally satisfied with the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sach a life saver for us. We fight for money here..kisi ko calculation nahi aati. Thank you Splitwise 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, the way it keeps the track and organises in simplistic way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Complicated - user interface not that much user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful application for those go trips and split money equally"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Usefull app..👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great App, just needs a payment gateway added to it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool and love the P.S. animal! Hyperlink :)"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant if you share expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really a good application for bachelor who are staying in rooms or for friends to split there amount according to their usage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps ever invented. Saves a lot of effort and brainstorming especially during trips. The ""Simplify debts"" option is a life saver."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible UI. Nothing is clearly simplified."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for managing group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for college friends group who spends in sharing. Great app for group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Shukriya🤗"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just sorted out a holiday with 10 other people with no fuss! It'alot less bother than a spreadsheet and tens of receipts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is overall good. But an important point to notice, it calculates the share of each person wrong due to which a lot confusion arises. Please look into it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was doing great until it had a bug. Now I can't open it and all my shared expense records are there with some of my friends and we don't know how to reconcile the funds. Seems like it may not work in all countries and in all devices."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Complicates already complicated group payments. This app sucks at its only selling point it has."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app, only thing that needs to be fixed is when you go into activity, then you scroll down few times to open an old expense, then when you click back to go to the activities page, it will bring you all the way to the top of thr activity page rather than the last scrolled down position."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy. Would have taken me hours to do this for 13 people. The simplify option is the best!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Utterly bad unreliable non-app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to use in any group spending activity, especially during travel. Simple, easy to use and efficient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using the app for 4 years now. Nothing beats its simplicity!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Split expenses with friends, roommates, group trips, and more Splitwise is the easiest way to share expenses with friends and family and stop stressing about “who owes who.” Millions of people around the world use Splitwise to organize group bills for households, trips, and more.

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The very great app to manage group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Transaction security not available, you have to secure those transactions which is is put by user, because any budy can change all entry . required security level ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app! Helped with my family. Feature needed: save your standard split ratio. Me and my partner split things 70: 30, make it easier for expenses to do that. There are lots of options but not an easy one. For this. You have to type in 70 30 each time on each expense. Which doesn't sound like much. But every time you're buying something? I'm doing it again and again and again. Good app though!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Handles large groups very poorly. Splits don't update if they are added before entire group joins, randomly ignores certain costs when simplifying debts (i.e. I am owed $50 but also owe someone who is already paying me). Contacted devs about it and they basically said I need to do a multi step manual workaround to get splits to update when automating that is ... you know... the entire point of the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for shared expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app. Highly useful and intuitive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly. The itemizing of picture is kind of buggy. Wish i could use picture someone sent me rather than one i take. Also would be amazing if ibcould use a ""dummy"" name. Some people are not open to using this so then i cant use splitwise to help me split it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really functional app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Idk what's wrong with this app. At first it was perfectly fine. Now it's glitching showing I owe my friend about 400 bucks but there is no history or track record of it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application, but it would be best if we could link our bank and make bank transfers to settle our accounts securely."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App not opening in Vivo V23 Pro after latest updated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very accurate and easy to use. Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything is fine apart from the minimise transaction button which should be made more obvious"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for roommates and friends 😜"

"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Difficult to search for items and categories, not easy to see through."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I find a bug for this, when I am adding expenses to group and personal. At time of settlement there is problem that expenses in group are not considered while settelment. Please update on this as soon as possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"All good but please add facilities for personal expenses data keeping where's we can keep records where we are spending money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm so satisfied and person like me who is terrible at maths got the better and best help from this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app for roommates 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app with good options to split the expenses made by diff grp members. It wud be good to have the option of recording payment made by more than 1 person for 1 single transaction. Right now we have to make 2 different entries."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Payments can be made via PayPal which charge awful fees. My mum paid me back via this and £20 is gone in fees. Use another payment provider that is modern."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its great app and useful for every age group. Smart App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not able to pay directly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have a question regarding deletion of entry. Why my entry deletion feature is given for my partner? Anytime my partner can delete my expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great experience and it very easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Does the work, Although I see one problem when I add an expense for a future date the app count the amount for the present date, I not sure if in premium app this is an option."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bugs bugs bugs. All balance values are incorrect for more than a week now and the team has not resolved this. Horrible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst MVP level charts feature. If you're making it a paid feature, atleast put some basic work into it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Buggy ! Can't sign in with Google. Can't use password recovery link texted to me on S23. Had to use my web browser"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for people who dine out frequently e.g. students in the hostel. This app really helps in tracking of loans."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great apps for calculating the expenses..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. I just this almost daily. For recurring transactions, it would be great to have it entered automatically at the same time each day (say 9am), or at a default that we can set. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to manage payments and debts. Must for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Add option for temp dummy users"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Is splitwise pay only available in the US? I cannot enter my Austrian address."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really, really useful app! Easy to use and lots of different functions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It has become terrible - when u use Paytm option, you have to feed in the amt once again in Paytm. After payment is completed u have to go back to splitwise and confirm that the amt is settled manually. A couple of months ago, these payments were being automatically recorded and settled"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to edit group. Can't delete or add easily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not showing properly calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app overall. I'm missing multi-language support though. I would even consider contributing to this effort if that was possible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great idea, useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Literally the most confusing app. I have tried to use this app 4 times now with extreme confusion and frustration among my group of friends. Just track your expenses in a note app and Venmo much easier and less of a headache"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool. Works perfectly. App is easy to understand and straightforward to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app very useful. Sharing the final expenses through WhatsApp or email will be good to have."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For my sister's bachelorette party last summer, we had a weekend trip with all her bridesmaids. Different people paid for food, gifts, decorations, etc., there were around 7 of us and it was really complicated to figure out who owed what to whom. Someone suggested this app, we all downloaded it, and it was amazing. It worked smoothly and made it easy to pay each other. I will definitely use this app again and recommend it to others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to manage the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Someone turned on the ""simplify debts"" feature, and it made me to owe same amount to everyone in the group increasing my debt to an unreasonable number. E.g. a group member whole experience was $10, but in ""Settle up"" step the app asks me to pay him $113.95 (?). We had to abandon the app accounting and redo everything in Excel."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. I have been using it for many years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ramesh ki"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is an amazing app. it hepled us a lot in our trip to handle the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Glorified calculator. No instructions or settings to set up payments just automatically sends to Venmo using the email address you used for splitwise. Which in my case are not the same. I can math, so don't see the purpose of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App!!! And just like me, was made in Providence RI, USA 🇺🇸 ❤️"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app , easy splitting of bills, great for trips and even for small expenses routinely. Works smoothly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"There is compulsary to add mobile no. while adding the member. But if there is any member (in case of minor age or senior citizen) not having a mobile phone or not having a smartphone, we can't add him/ her in the group list. So, It will be more pleaseful if there will be any solution for that 😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have had it for many years and love the functionality and convenience it brings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Attached Image quality to be improove."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Has everything that you want."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to control and manage your finances. I'd download it again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Once a contact has been accepted as friend, then there's no option to edit/change the contact details of that person like phone number & email ID. Until they are accepting as friend Requesting to kindly look into this issue."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to handle all expense via this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great algorithm that makes it really easy to track multiple transaction at a time which really saves up the time of calculating big numbers. Good job guys👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hopelessly screwed UI, will make everything impossible to understand before you post, and even more so *after* you post (expenses)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to navigate !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not working on LG GX8 Android 12"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Depresses the person on last day of settlement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"May I know how your app stand's relevant with the feature launch of Splitwise option in Phonepe ? Would be glad if you respond."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not working properly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app is very functional and easy for me to use. I really wish the ""home"" or default layout showed your total balance. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is due to it being rather difficult for seniors to use. Both my mother and father have been added to many of my family accounts (phone, TV, internet, etc) and they have a very hard time understanding the application and end up paying me separately for each group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app, but might required a few additional feature such as; 1. Paid and unpaid labeling. So we would know which items in the list of debts that has been paid before the final settlement. 2. Invitation reminder in the beginning would be better to be connected to WhatsApp or other social messaging apps instead of sms. This would allow participants from different countries to collaborate easier. 3. Cannot undo comments that have been sent. Overall, pretty satisfied!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"THEEE BESSTTT APPP EVERR ! SOLVED MYY EVERY MONEY RELATED PROBLEMS 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯! CREATOR NAILEDD ITT !!!! THANKS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION!!! MORE SUCCESS ON YOUR WAY MANN !! GREAT JOB !!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"BIG DRAWBACK : You will have to enter a person's contact details in order to have them included in Splitwise for expenses splitting. Otherwise you can't include them at all & the app becomes paper weight."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent Would prefer it will be automatically connected to the wallets"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant Apt. Takes care of big pain area when you do Group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful. Easy. Satisfying."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: If any one member is not to be included in a particular expense, there should be an option to exclude particular person."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Seemed to work well but I would have appreciated the option of viewing the computations in real time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Kicked out of a group I created lol."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application to manage daily expenses and track properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very practical app tho 1 thing is missing: + function when you have to split unequally, first you have to add up the sum of everyone and then type it in. why not simply add a + function?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Vertical trash"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Poorly made"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app that really does simplify splitting bills in pretty much any scenario. Saves friendships!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great and it's handy as hell. My friends and I paid for a vacation on this and it made it so easy to split all our various bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps out there for the record of all the kacha-chithha among frnds. 😄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Do NOT use the payment feature of this app. In fact stick with Excel. Using this app with a group has been a terrible experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I had given 5 stars before but now I want tk give 1 star to the performance of the app... It's not opening only now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Needs a search function"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It was a good app to track the spending of the household and compare the graph of three months on the category. However, it's really bad to remove the graph features in each spending. The app is now as normal as a note pad and only to spilt among friends. Spiltwise is turning to be useless!! Edit: i am glad they fix the graph to show three months trend of the category:)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Vera level useful !! 💯"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cheating as the Pro version disappeared. I purchased the Pro version on 2 January 2023. After 4 months the Pro features disappeared and now its asking me to purchase again. When I said I have purchased this, it said purchase can't be restored. This is nothing but cheating customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track of what's owed and what you owe! Like the interface and how simple it is to use. Would highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy way out to get the expenses sorted out in the trips, handy and easy available options for getting the things noted up and split up !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No option to pay someone. What's the sense of this. I could just write it down."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app, only one suggestion after settling up my debt, the receiving side should also confirm before settling up. That makes more sense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep track of shared expenses especially on holiday trips with friends! It is awesome that it supports multiple currencies but I wish it is able to add conversion rate used so we don't have to manually calculate that at the end of a trip. Maybe there are better features in the pro version but the basic version is already very good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easily the most intuitive and comprehensive cost splitting app out there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Overall apps is great and usefull! I just love it! But it can be much more convenient if have the option to add the taxes. As an example, the 6% service charge for a restaurant"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly and super convenient!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not running smoothly on my old Huawei phone.. I don't what their hardware and software requirements are now.. Used to be a good smooth app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app for friends hangout and outdoor meals"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app itself is very easy and quick to set up. It makes the job of keeping track of who owes who money a breeze! It does all the maths for me 😅😍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app in terms of Spiliting the expense. It also shows 'How much you spend this month'. Must use this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App for Trip with Friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for vacation with friends, a must have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it. So useful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for group tour"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Useful for its niche, but clunky and opaque for power users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There should be a filter option so that each member can see the expenses in details in which only he/she is included."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"All worked out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful for group bills and trips. Highly recommend it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Usse Experience Bad, hard to understand and split expenses problem"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app. Love the interface 😍😍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mst app bole toh ek dum"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please make simplified"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App for Tracking group expense and sharing. I'm a paid user, and it's definitely worth for the Money 💰."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This has made our group holidays SO much easier. LOVE! 😍💯"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Beware of this app ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Send emails saying you have Rs.X you are owed, makes you downloadthe all only to see that it's made up gibberish records. Falsely claims you have an account already."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's easy to use but can't access details on how and why the value raised or downed for each individual payment and after clicking over a friends profile one should be able to get detailed transaction and owed amount which will be quite helpful for future reference and easy escalation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I was about to disown my friends for dumb calculations but splitwise saved our friendship. Thanks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love your app sir g"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Bothers me constantly to use the subscription or their new payment system. Numerous bugs that cause me to force restart and it hasn't worked well on the Chromebook side either. I'm about done with Splitwise and will be looking for alternatives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Basic idea good. Very shallow features. I think a good spreadsheet with some pivot tables might be better. You can't easily see the transactions for an account. Maybe in a pro version?! 😂 So, that's how shallow it is. In the end, we used a calculator to just do it. Too bad, entry of amounts was nice, and supported multiple currencies, good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app no need to write on paper. Note the expenses on the go and it's done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Does not calculate properly. Should have a breakdowm of the transaction per user."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. Saves me time. However, please fix the bug wherein when moving an expense from one group to another, the one who paid for that expense is not being retained. It is being reaasigned to me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I am using this app for almost 10 years and found no other app which does better in splitting the amount the way it does. If it could give option to see expenses and split on weekly basis that would be a really value addition to the app. Thank you Developer for this app. It would be helpful if you would look into this suggestion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good service nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"P. S. Love the bunnies!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does what it's supposed to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Absolutely Stupid Application 😡 Confusing, complex and cumbersome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App should include the feature of acknowledging the payment done by others as approve or reject. Due to number of transactions getting hit, user should be aware of any payment he/she receives."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Easy to enter expenses, but difficult to determine status of expenses for each person."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not working for my device Vivo v23"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent and amazing app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull and user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to calculate and settle the bills in a group activity/outing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Lot of times this app crashes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Split Function has bug when new members enters in group and split doesn't work correctly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. It's supposed to simplify transactions but it just complicated everything. Based on the math this app provided, I got 3 different totals. We had to export the ledger and do everything by calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app for tracking group expenses. If it has pay from app features I would have given it 5 Stars. I think it's most important features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very poor performance by the app, I was living happy with my life, then one of my friend suggested me to download this app to split up our spendings, suddenly I owe 150₹ out of no where, now I'm depressed and feeling lonely, don't wanna go outside and have fun.....chiii"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Yeah this app is great. Does everything you want it to and makes splitting payments between friends and flatmates really easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! Makes it so easy to account for all shared expenses when doing a group trip/event and then pay people and/or receive payment when it's over. Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is great at what it does. So great that me and my friends went on a trip, one of my friends uses it and suggested to keep track of the trip expenses and we installed it on our phones. Another one of my friends got so hooked up with the app that he kept using it for every single expense and also kept forcing us to use it. Almost ruined the trip. We still give him a hard time whenever we plan any trips or have any occasion where splitting even our expenses. Great job, Splitwise. Love it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app to keep running tab on bills with friends and family. Really easy to use, categorise, date and add currency type. Removes fuss and hassle of balances between groups"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am trying Splitwise on my ChromeOS and the software is not behaving well at all. Sometimes is works well and othertime half the page is blank and unresponsive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for day-in day-out expense tracking and management. One of the few suggestions - there should be an option for automatic monthly reminders to those who owe money. Also, another option to directly request money from the linked bank account of the person who owes you money. It would be nice to deal with people who don't pay you back on time!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.. very useful and no confusion"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Can only upload one image and they only support 2mb image which your files can be compress. PDF file are not supported."

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Don't Trust the Export function!!I generally like the app, pretty useful, but when I export the data the report is not correctly dividing the money across the participants.It seems to assign DOUBLE the correct amount to the person who paid, & the correct amount to the others, when Split Equally is selcted and the data is correct in app.This makes me question the whole thing!Also, I would like to see other peoples expenditure in the Totals too, so I can have confidence in how the amounts add up."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app, no need of much manual calculations now.. and no more quarrel among us room mates, I actually made an excell sheet which works the same way, later I discovered splitwise, it has got many more features than a regular excell sheet (to be honest, it is also very difficult to make them)."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ive ever seen. Solves all those splitting issues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why send an SMS and not WhatsApp? Who still uses SMS?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"But it really require a payment method to complete the payment. Let user add their upi ids so the payment can be done easily by clicking upi id and selecting any upi app to complete transaction. This is must needed feature. If that feature available this deserve 5 star."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time I use it I always encounter the same issue that has been there forever and never fixed (even though many users reported it): there's no way to split expenses in a group with someone that joins the group after the expense was added. This happens in any big trip: it take days for everyone to join the group and you basically cannot add any expense until *everyone* has joined (or you can, but you have to re-enter them all later). This is pointless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome features, covers almost all the basic methods of expense tracking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app keeps on crashing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great way to split your costs on a girl's break away!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome 😎👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"L m ll⬛♋♋♠️♋♋💢🇲🇳♋♋♋🧱🖱️🖱️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Aweful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is great, and the itemized receipt premium feature is worth the subscription! It's too bad I can't seem to put in an item representing a discount though. Why would you allow no negative numbers at all? It makes faintly more complex receipts more difficult to manage."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's an extremely convinient way to track debts among freinds ans groups of people. It also directly interfaces with venmo to make tracking payments easier. To top it all off, there's a hidden bunny button! :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't even log into the app due to the 2FA. Get past the login, token gets sent to email so I swap to the app to get the token, but upon swapping back the application asks me to login again, thus resetting the token. Just really stupid/bad design, had to use another device and log into my email just to get into the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No way of deleting account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"User experience is very poor and consolidation is extremely confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great 😃👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to split up expenses on a holiday with friends. Top app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful, use it all the time for trips. Makes life so much easier and gives you a good overview of your spending. 10/10 would recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expenses are not syncing with server"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is frozen after passcode lock is setup."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Showing different amount of share in Groups. All persons have different share balance in their login"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It does complex splitting in easy way which anybody can understand. Good ui. Easy to use. What more can I ask. One of the most useful app I've used in recent times. Saved me a lot of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love the app, very efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelkent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful and super easy to use 😸😸😸!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wants every one in the group to sign up( not everyone wanted to ) one person didnt have a smart phone, exported exspence file wasn't in pdf.. no one could read it...couldn't use it for just one person to keep track of spending...over complicated easier with pen and paper."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can this app scan bills, be it more simple that way?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good App. But on iphone you can add people to expenses that were entered before they join the group, on Android you can't! What? Fix it please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. Great UI and simple functions, easy to use. Just try to set the payment currency by default using country."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"🙏🏼 nice app it's solve more unwanted tension 🙏🏼💐🙏🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"You can add Calculator functionality in your app too :))"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"My personal experience with splitwise is that its just okay. I really don't like how compared to a lot of money transferring apps (IE. CashApp and Venmo) is that in order to verify you and your account just to add your bank account is that you have to get mailed a code. It feels like a VERY clunky way to verify my account and on top of that there's also no instant cash out option for my payments. I wouldn't mind paying a fee but not having it, especially when you need your money at times sucks."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app has saved me a huge amount of difficult calculations for calculating my split expenses. It is very good. Just the language needs to be more easier to understand."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time I use splitwise someone settles up before all expenses are in. Every time! It's the most basic thing and they still haven't fixed it, and now they don't even have a mobile site so they force you to download those garbage app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is a phenomenal app for keeping a track of group payments and how to split. Simplfies your life. 10/10 recommend.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I don't care about the technicality. This app helped me find my wife."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"SUPER"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There should be more transparency on what is calculated in the background, some formulas on how that number is derived when you click on what you owe or owed would be extremely helpful, rather than this person owe you this much, okay but why? We have a group of 4 and only 2 people have recent transactions, but the 2 nonparticipatants have also been added to the calculation, resulting in unnecessary transactions. This isn't the first time and very frustrating."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use app when you go on trips and also for daily transaction records keeping"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ab ghar bechna nahi padega 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application for roommates.thanks"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Little complicated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for group holidays. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"1. Requesting to add UPI payment to settle balances. 2.The best app that one can find in playstore for sharing room spendings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Aap is good but there needs to be a confirmation option for the receiver when the money is paid through cash by the borrower."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please include the option for interest on debt, So that people pay and I don't go broke"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this application but i feel it should me add more features like income and expenses tracking with bank syncing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for Dutch slipts. Could start taking in pics of receipts and read bill amount from that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"They should just merge Plates with splitwise in one app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"testing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good very nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very simple easy ane efficient app for managing different splits among several people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and UI is also nice. Almost no ads."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One suggestion. You can give an option to upload bill for each expense so that others can check whether the expense uploaded is correct or not."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Useful but not 100%. It needs a field for bank account information in user profile, so you now where to transfer to settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Poorest of the poor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not responding suddenly. Not able to navigate to any menu. Tried multiple times."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the app automatically close when open, doesnt work with latest Android"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great experience till now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good, but has issues. I don't see why you can't save the PayPal login other than to annoy people into using your proprietary payment method, which, no thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Didn't send reminders. Please update it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app ahead for finance 🤠 any issues is there from last update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very simple and useful app, missing the possibility to create graphics and statistics in the free version. Too high the price to go Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Weird experience. Not sure why the computations are wrong. This app is a good idea but its so complicated and to use. We just switched to doing notes again instead of this as it just make our things complicated and it stressed us all. The user experience of this app is just not that good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Integrate paymeny option for every person"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is not working properly need to update the payment options, the amount which shown to settle up and directed to online payment doesn't reflect there. Once again we have to type the money to settle up. And now another problem is that it doesn't recording the settled up money directly for online payment manually we have to record.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It makes group holidays so simple."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app Does what's it is meant for PERFECTLY."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes the hard things in life easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Love this app. Using since several years now... One feature is missing which makes my life hard now.. If I received some money from someone and want to split that among group members, currently there's no way of achieving the same.. Kindly let me know if this can be added"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App is not synchronising all members expenses since a weak. Pls settle this issue."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Add direct pay option from the shown money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has stopped functioning totally. It freezes everytime I open it since the last update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is really awesome!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Tough to track and messy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Behaving badly wrongly calculating expenses worst experience in recent months"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"In an effort to push Splitwise Pay, they've made it super hard to find how to adjust one's Venmo settings. I don't want to pay using Splitwise -- I want to stick with known methods of payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best in the business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful for group trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Комфортно"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lot's of bugs sometimes calculations are affected"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Très utile pour savoir où on est en dans les dépenses du foyer. Pouvoir personnaliser certaines entrées serait un plus"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really helps to settle expenses and balances amongst groups. Just wish there was a deleting feature when the event/group is done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Zabardast app h"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing tool. As someone who needs to keep track of a lot of debts and expenses, this made my life a whole lot easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Add clearer confimation of payment notification."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible account balance management! You have to wait very long time to access and transfer your money when someone pays you. They also make it very hard to access your balance in the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Once you understand the working of app, it's too easy and very helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A really convenient app. I use it with friends every time we go on a trip together."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can improve more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app, but it creates little confusion as it adjusts amount too much, sometimes you won't understand untill you make some caluclation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Saving lots of time and energy 👍🏻🤘🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every since Splitwise Pay was created, if you or someone else sign up, you are default to using it, even if you don't like it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for friend group vacations!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Nkt working properly"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved it...❤️ Great app for group expenses... Really useful... 👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I have OnePlus 8T, app is not functioning properly. I am not able to access anything since 1 month or more. Please check with it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. But there is no direct payment gateway like add a card or via GooglePay etc. Integrate that and I'll 5 star it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the most Useful app.❤️Loved it's Simplicity and Features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Didnt get the experience that wanted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App to manage your personal finance. Happy customer for years now. Just a quick thought, it would be helpful if you can introduce simple calculator as well before adding the expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app, must download this when you travel in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Naveen Bro...Love you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not at all precie calculation at the end"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"1. Should have option of ""paid by few, shared by few"" where ""few"" are selectable members of group. 2. Should include option to add initial contributions from which expenses get subtracted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for clubbing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application to keep track on finances when you travelling with your friend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Dada thankyou dada tumche khup khup aabhar. Aaj tumhi mala vachavlay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Decent experience, seen better apps like go-dutch but that has been shut down now. Split Karo is a better alternative cuz of it's instant bills and collections features and it's integration with apps like swiggy and Zomato, that let's you split bills from fetching orders from the order history of these apps directly. It has better payment integrations as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's an great app but people don't know the value of you😢"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app ☺️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is bug. Anyone can add you in any group. I downloaded this app today after few years and I don't know why I am seeing groups and people which I don't even know. Few unknown group with transactions showing in Singapore and US dollar. It's showing wrong information. You owe to people which you don't know."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a few years, mostly on trips where I'm splitting costs with a friend. It's invaluable and you can split costs many diff ways. We take turns paying and then we settle up in the end. I can't live w/o it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They deliberately broke Venmo integration to push their new ""Splitwise Pay"" platform that REQUIRES A COPY OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Moving to another platform."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very smart app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saved me a lot of money. I had people who owed me money and were saying its only a couple hundred but then in total it came to around £2000 so definitely download it and make a note of everything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it but it can be more improve in term UI like more user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The settle up is such a great feature! But could be improve with a tutorial for first time user (or I skipped that part...). Anw, great app would recommend it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Intuitive and super useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I mean, it's a pretty niche use for an app, but the screencaps are perfect evidence for taking my ex to small claims. So, i can't say I don't recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really usefull application!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Should give the option of changing my payment method. I still can't change my old account details and people send money to old account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Why isn't giving options to add UPI payments"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely functional"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app... Must have app for trip with friends and family..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App working good, but advance amount collected the participants unable to mention in it. Need to add Advance transaction option in it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Trying to add an expense by adding people individually, unable to do so. After the 2nd person is added, no matter what i type the app shows a W and just doesn't allow me to type anything"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Will satisfy all your financial-shared needs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for debts tracking between friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App keeps crashing when clicking on add expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is not splitting bill properly, accounting on different people. Bad experience. Using for 6 months but not working properly now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an awesome app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"A new group created after a trip is not reflecting in my app, so I don't know whom I owe or who owes me. I don't even know if they cleared their full amount. Very bad experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Difficult to ever find settle up button"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's good when u have liability friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app to track your group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent; so easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I think it is a great app to use and also very easy to use. It is very useful if you live with your friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do I need to invite people just to do simple expenses? Your business model is flawed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and organized"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A fantastic app for road trips and long vacations with multiple people. Very intuitive app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app and a must have tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, practical and intuitive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A really helpful tool. Makes groceriey shopping with housemates easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works just as the name says. Clean and Simple 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Advertising in my notifications. Unacceptable."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A perfect application ever produced for all events, groups and what not."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Had always been a great app up until this latest update. Now, if I am clicking on Settle Up with someone, the app simply closes/crashes! What's up with that?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must for everyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app is good for maintaining the expenses but computes wrong amount in terms of money owed and also shows wrong member list to whom you owe money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its not splitting and showing accurate balance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing wrong amount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, with lot of features and that too free of charge. Good work team, I appreciate Splitwise to bring such an awesome app to market. Thx 😊🚩♥️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for splitting expenses. Seamless experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Was really to use and manage trip expenses for group trips. Made tracking so easy without having to worry about the math, splitwise did it all!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps ever. Easy to use and very useful for going on trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect App for splitting bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app offers everything I need when sharing expenses. I love to use it so much, that I even opened the playstore myself and navigated here just in order to give them my 5 stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is not working properly whenever I open this app to include my expense it closes automatically. Fix this bug ASAP"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I used this app to split shares among friends. Not a bad experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice app... Simple UI... It would really be helpful if it simplifies the expenses for a same friend who's in a grp expenses as well as in personal...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing! No ads, no bloatware downright straight forward and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Stupid. Adding group members later should also include them in the already entered expenses. Will move on to settle up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing app! Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplify the life"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A work of genius. Makes splitting expenses easy when travelling with a group. No more fiddling about with multiple cards at the restaurant"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"- Friends may have the same profile picture and even same name - Adding a friend FORCES you to send a text message through a modal pop-up instead of normal share dialog - unnecessary illustrations in screens - split options are confusing - shares(??) - adjustment - this would all be ok if they had like 1. a tutorial or 2. an ""advanced mode"" setting - why aren't my different currencies converting - the add user search bar is really not apparent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Baadi acchi app hain lekin baadi kharab bhi"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot it's a very useful app.. It has taken away headache of splitting up trip expenses. It would be great if you guys can add a chat feature for group,which will be there till group gets settled up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Apps is lagging everytime I open it. Can't press any button😶🙃. It's functional but laggy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for travelling with a travel buddy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do you require a login? Just to grab data?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, so helpful for dividing group expenses and always works flawlessly!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I hope there is an option that we can add participants without adding their phone numbers. My friend freak out when she received a text message from the app. She's thought it's a scam. Lol."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and effective"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It was good!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Strongly recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"application is user friendly, easy to use, i like it but unfortunately to maintain my daily expenses I am using different application. Can you add one more feature to this application to maintain the list of our own expenses over weekly and monthly manner."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"option for rupees please"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and usefully"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just wish it had a simple calculator somewhere when entering expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is useless... The track of exact amount needed to paid and returned showed are all flawed. Me and my group of friends have been facing this issue for a while."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Please make sure that simplify group debts works properly. The feature has a lot of bugs ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Real trouble getting a user working. Couldn't seem to modify their email address when they had signed in group with a different one. Sorted in the end..love the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes it easier to split cost with friends.. worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. It does exactly what it's supposed to and every feature exists where I expect it to be. Anyone who doesn't like this app must not understand the intended purpose. I track expenses with family/friends that we intend to split fairly with repayments possibly not happening immediately. This app manages that perfectly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Unable to remove friends from group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Works great for dealing with split cost. Went to Portugal/Spain and used it all the time together with my friends..easy as 123!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Completely frozen now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app! Saved us in a long trip, very convenient to use."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful.....🔥🔥💯💯"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to keep track of group and private expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is not functioning properly from many days. Every time I open the app, it closes automatically and I have to reopen it. This has been going on for a while and is quite frustrating since it's happening everytime I open the app. Recently I added a transaction in a group and it keeps showing an unexpected error happened - transaction failed to sync with server an unexpected error happened. Neither can i remove it from my transactions nor can I add it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a good app to maintain good record of your money expenditure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app in my phone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for splitting expenses among people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app keeps all worry of accounting away. Loved it a lot . It is hassle-free. Can pay directly from app or this app also reminds to pay back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The perfect app just if you could make it possible to have multiple accounts so that anyone that doesn't have a smartphone could be on it would be great thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to split the bills, record your expenses. Perfectly created."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App seems good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would like to be able to select groups and get balance owed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall very good except translation in Marathi or Hindi not available. Plz add ability to choose app langauge"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool to split shared payments. Very flexible and easy to use. I love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am not able to even log in, it shows an error no access to internet even my internet is on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I could not love this app more! This has been a game changer for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why does your app doesn't open in one go. I just get a blank screen with nothing visible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Started using it and it makes it very easy to manage expenses with flatmates and friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I looked the different ways of splitting, but ""by adjustment"" should allow to input someone paying less that the rest, not just more. We have come across situations in my group where one pays less than the other 4 and we need to manually add the extra to four people instead of minus value to one person. The keypad suggests I should be able to minus and in the Apple app of my friend adjustments are ""+/-"" but only allows +"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Soo many glitches"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life changing app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I can't add people without adding their mobile numbers or email addresses. I need to add names only."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good expirience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This seems to work rather well... but the language it uses is odd. It seems to be worded to aid in clarity... but the terms are incorrect. I'm sure it all works out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Its a good app but recently its so temperamental. Once you open it it freezes and you cant press anything in the app. When you leave the app, everything else on my phone works fine its just inside the app. I was hoping updating would fix it but still the same problem. It always takes me about 6 goes to add an expense now ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I really liked this app and used it a lot. But in 2023 it started to freeze everytime I opened it. The only thing that worked was re-installing the app. Now it froze again...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Avoids a row with the Mrs. 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an awesome app. Seriously."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad programming that allows the program to contact group members without the account owners permission"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app for dividing expenses with flatmates.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for keeping track of expenses and simplified payments makes this app very helpful and handy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Anyone can change or edit or delete the split (bill) in the group so this change has to be done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Idea is great, I really like it it will simplify the costs process and saving time! My suggestion is that they can provide 1min youtube video that why at the end the user has to transfer to specific friend who is in the list of costs. And how it works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app I have ever used."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very nice and easy app to record group spending , it would be better if it can track gpay spending and allow us to add entry from those .. if they show the list of transaction on gpay when I open the app I can choose and add it here easily without forgetting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very clean UI"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Cool app for expenses tracking"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Need improvement - Can you bring security option to particular group record or add security to hidden groups?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After pass key hang it not working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really useful app. Reducing 1 star as it does not have any IPv6 support. Did not work in IPv6 only network."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app takes away all the hassle of splitting bills or keeping up with who has payed more or less when travelling in a group Can also be use by kids to split costs in school projects within the team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Its a great Application. Devlopers are much appreciated for such a useful application. Giving 3 star coz it lacks very important feature of putting admin rights on group so that settings can't be manipulated by other members in groups. Thats one suggestion. It getts messy in that case (talking from experience lol)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very wonderful app. Very much user friendly & user experience. Easy to add person, group, expenses & payments,etc. But currently it's not working,it just opens up & no response to any action or touch on the app options or any feature. It's not working at all. I just touch any option & it don't work no response at all. Nothing's working in it. Pls rectify it soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just installed this app. By default seeing someone called ""Simon"" getting added. Unable to delete this user. Becoming very irritating due to this. Some bug/Easter egg in the software? Not sure if anyone else is facing this problem."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb 💯"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Forcing to go through their payment system and enter your bank info now. No option to opt out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app in the world. Waste of time . Don't use it please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience Getting batter day by day ... I hope more advance feature will add up I am using since 2018"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Wonder if there's a way to schedule a recurrent expense to stop? i.e. repeat only 3 times."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for recording petty expenses in a trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, does the job without problems. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Seems pretty easy to do just about anything. Some other user's complaints about certain functions were not actually a problem once you mess around with it for a while and figure it out."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"O app só serviu pra registrar despesas. Por algum motivo não faz nenhuma conta. Só me deu dor de cabeça."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Bang onn"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We have used Splitwise for 12 months to manage the running of our boat which is co-owner by 4 people. It is easy to use and clearly displays your contribution including separation of currencies. I would subscribe to the Pro version but I cannot see us using most of the additional facilities."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really great app for tracking expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Complicated/ slower than Venmo. Just use the calculator on your phone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Much helpful!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This review is for Splitwise pay, it takes 3-5 days to process the payment while PayPal is instantaneous."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The house were very personal information not sure I like this, like social security number for instance and I believe they checked my credit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to share bills when travelling in group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Every time i download it.. it gives me internet connection error. Could not login either."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"🚫🚫🚫🚫Worst app, very big error in calculation! Don't recommend to anyone!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really the best app for the exp shares"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Mobile app is missing the ""itemized"" mode that is available on the website. It's hard to handle certain things (e.g. dinner bills) without this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing. Made the trip so easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, just made the group spending simpler."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, really very useful when traveling in groups to keep record easily and efficiently, love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All my old transactions were deleted. But Balances are reflecting correctly. I updated to newer version even though no luck."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful during trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps to resolve all your trip expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is best app for splitting all the expenses between friends and family for any tour or outing, absolutely loved splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Its a very nice app , it helps me with all my finances but there is a issue in the app : when we settle money through the app then it does not get deduced from the total amt. Hope you look through it and improve it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very efficient!!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect buddy for friends trip Used to share cost between our friends expenses during our last visit. Spot on. Amazing to see final summary and we loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app ,must have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not focused on UI/UX. Should be more intuitive and user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Used this app on multiple holidays and has always served me very well. I decided to try out the premium version mostly for the itemised receipt function. However, the OCR doesn't seem to work well in countries which have large demoninations. It tends to read 10,000 as 10.00. This wouldn't of been a problem had I known from the start of the trip as you could just record all transactions (/1000) but difficult to adjust mid-way. Either improve OCR or perhaps allow to multiply everything recorded."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Simple to use.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Buggy. The app sometimes creates duplicates transactions or doesn't go through at all. Splitwise pay doesn't work well with chime banking, but neither does Venmo, so tbh thats a Chime problem too. My roommates keep having notification problems as well. Anyway, I manage all rental finances for myself and four roommates- rent, electric, water, Comcast, groceries, the works. This app helps me tons to organize. When it works, it works great. I like the way it integrates with Venmo. Would recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Coool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for managing expenses for a group family or friends trip with unequal splitting feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app! In fact I've influenced all my friends to start using it for all our trips and outings. There's transparency on how the bills were split so all expenses can be reviewed by everyone properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This makes weekends with friends so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Provide provision for Advance payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing product Good to keep track and pay Love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Solves a special but important issue. Nice user experience. Smart app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very Handy App for every aspect of life. Hope they continue to improve and let the free version work as it is"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The most useful app I have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been a wonderfull experience in 3 years of using this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, makes life convenient, especially when splitting bills during roadtrips, potlucks, and house bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app! The only thing missing is payment integration into major payment providers to make actual payment through the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It is not working after an update! It just opens and none of the groups opens and unable to add expenses.. Installed on OnePlus 5T."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Hpw to delete activity?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Incorrect calculation, highly displease"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its just amazing!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Can you explain how to export data in csv file ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App isnew for me but overall experience is good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So today I look to calculate charges and thr app has turned into a mess. Its not adding up things correctly idk when it updated to keep all the charges together, before it cleared everything when it was paid and there was a SEPARATE list of charges and now the charges are all showing together on a list and everything is mixed up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to like this app, but lately it's been wrongly calculating balances owed to people that didn't even upload an expense. Balances are not calculated accurately and not allocated to the proper people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The simplyfy debts updates algorithm is faulty"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app with very good UI/UX. Top notch!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App, makes keeping track of your spending and sharing expenses with your partner so easy! Creates fairness in any shared expenses if you reliably put it in. Also functions as a track record, so great! 👏🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Una le to unblock/unhide group/user , I tried to remove user from the group which I could have only option to block the user but when I block the user entire group gor disappeared and I cannot find option to undo this changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I m unable to open the app it is just showing me the option of Uninstall I have installed it again but still it is the same"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The base app experience is fine, but the splitwise pay/wallet feature is disastrous. As happens anytime a tech company thinks they can incorporate banking easily it's unreliable and slow (3-5 business days for a transfer: Venmo and Zelle do it in 0 to 2). My guess is the regulatory burden & potential for complaints & suits will have this feature shut down within 6 months."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Sometimes it confuses us"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Wonderful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just perfect"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Sorry guys but if I have to calculate the summary on my own because it's not correct and if my colleague has another summary than me, we could have made the summary on a piece of paper."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Fake App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Works perfect for my household as well as for trips or nights out. Expenses can be added with whom it should be shared amongst. The app distributes the expenses and minimizes the amount of payments for each person. The reason I didnt rate 5 stars is because I would like the app to automatically choose category by taking previous inputs into account. The app does automatically input correct categories for like Hamburger or IKEA. But not with foreign names, that could be a feature if input before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a perfect application to manage your expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Cool for calculating and spliting expenses for travel groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"- using same email as login in web interface and in app, but details in web interface not visible in app - experience on android app > logged in first time, app sent a code on my gmail. Without closing splitwise app, I opened my gmail to see the code, and then tried getting back to splitwise - but it didnt show in open apps. Tried opening splitwise again - same experience repeated. 3rd time, did exactly the same, but it worked as expected for some reasons... just wierd"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app I ever seen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Crazy good!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's good for paying bills for a rent situation with friends but then it is so confusing if you move and want to cancel with those people. I have reached out to support 2 times and have not heard back or even got an email. Ugggg that sucks when support doest write back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App not working after unlocking facing issue from last 10 days"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice features, included all possibilities that can occur"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"UI needs an improvement. UI switches too much. You stack layers too many times where it can just be tabs. You lose track of where you are in the app easily, and really makes it hard to navigate. Also, I didn't like the fact that you record some expense, and then add a member, weirdly it didn't recognize that new member and showed incorrect amount my friend owes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow exprnc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not work properly some time stop working tab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is just incredible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app is well designed and already very useful with the free version. Especially the recurring entries make life easier. I subscribed to the Pro version primarily for scanning receipts. Unfortunately, this function is somewhat error-prone: often the process breaks off during scanning or entire sections are recognized twice or three times, which then have to be deleted manually. Very tiring, especially on mobile. I often scan on my phone and use the website to make the corrections there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm so happy to have found this app. Was struggling with Excel to track expenditures with my roommate and also for vacation funds. Love the features of adding notes and pictures. Absolutely convenient. Thank you and keep up the good work"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Being a UX designer, This have been one my favourite apps until it started glitching and showing wrong transactions. Felt bad after recommending it to my other friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Cheating app. Bad app. Don't use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not necessary to have an app just to know the split. Normal calculator also acts sufficient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best way to manage shared expenses, expecially during group trips of all kind. It saved me from much hassle when traveling with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Guys, you should have been added more bunnies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application to share expenses with friends! Easy, flexible, reliable. Thanks guys!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Lacks handling of direct transfers between group members"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Always had a wonderful experience. Just today (16-12-2022) I am not able to open the app today. Seems like it is crashed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for tracking expenses with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The updated version not ok the application is hang so much time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Messes up payments all the time. Good for tracking who owes what, but will accept payments to my email and behave as if it was sent to my venmo, while I receive no actual money. Do not recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Helpful app. Just one suggestion, while settling the expenses payment link to UPI will make payment easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing ! Makes life much easier - thanks to all the developers who made this. I just have one suggestion if you guys ever read it 😅 - It would be very helpful if you could also add something to keep track of things borrowed by your friends - chair, pan, etc. Could you guys please add this in your development cycle? Even if not, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for thinking about this and making this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My checking account was compromised and $200 was stolen after entering my banking info into their Splitwise Pay option which is facilitated by Plaid. When I try to contact support it glitches, freezes and keeps opening new mail messages locking up my phone- then I have to restart to get it to stop."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't install as it showing anything and not safe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm getting a bug, when adding a payment for a member it assigns it to some other randomly please fix"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to keep track and do the math for expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Freezes since recent update. Unfortunately I cannot use it as is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super intuitive, we've been using it for tracking our expenses as a couple and it's quick and easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"So annoying not to be able to add people without phone number or email. Went to Tricount instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good For Groups Expenses Split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just finished a week-long trip with a friend and this helped us stayed organized and made settling up easy. Can't thank you enough."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the latest update the app is not working properly its like the app is completely frozen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app has potential, but without many mode of payments this becomes kind off redundant. Pleae add more modes of settling debts like Credit/Debit cards and UPI."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Didnt expect this much from a free app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is the Greatest invention in human history It saved alot time of me and friends. Now we don't need to brainstorm our minds to do those troublesome calculation and accounting. Simply the best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Would not recommend. How things are being split & divided is simply not clear. One must blindly trust that the app is reconciling accurately & in the right currency (if used for an international trip) but there's no way to review this. The UX & UI need improvement & transparency."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a simple but great idea it is. Thanks for bringing up for us. Appreciate it💡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very useful, only one recomm ""Add sharing or %tile option while adding participants, which will be default later while adding expenses"" If possible add this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its not working properly, when open the app feel like stucked(touch not working),"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Changing 5 start to 1 star, due to new released app is hanging (Not responding app)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Rating for the latest update otheriwse 4 star. A bug is there and it keeps closing"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app for tracking daily expenses.Got stuck sometines"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After recent update splitwise not working in oppo mobile phone. I reinstalled splitwise now its working."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unfortunately once you create the group we cannot delete the group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the app; Very convinient and useful! Have been using since early days when they only had the web-based tool."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Cumbersome. Some basic functionality are missing: - cannot add myself to an already present expense - cannot select from a list the people when modifying an expense - cannot easily add a priori a person to the group as a placeholder until they actually do log in"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for keeping track of and settling expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple but great apps with lots of required features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Very easy to keep track of spending and settle the spendings between each others."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app to maintain your hisaab kitaab . I am personally using with 4 different groups since last 3-4 years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is very unique and useful app. Really every I went on the trip this app make the expenses much easy to handle among groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App was working great for me and my room mate.. Just between 2 people, till last week. Last few days the summary is so confusing, showing we both each other different amounts. Forced to move to settleup."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Bug app closes when I add an expense and try to put in a name."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Notice recent update Splitwise can't update, access to details at all. Appreciate if you can look into this issue soon. Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps out there!User friendly. It simplifies complex calculations. This app was our saviour during many of our trips and prevented us from having fights over money xD"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app User friendly and very responsive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Loved it until the app started freezing. When I open the app, it log me in, but just freezes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ee DD x for esse do Dr ESS s r rd Sharma for the d"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For a free service, it is excellent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For a person who always do shopping for their friends, this is in evitable. The features in the app is super cool and never failed for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ever since i moved out and started living in sharing with friends, it made expenses calculation so easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love the app, the reason I'm taking off a star is because the whole reason I moved from Google Pay to Splitwise Pay was to NOT have the virtual wallet that requires manually transferring money out when received. Would love if there was a way to use Splitwise Pay but automatically transfer money received to my bank."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Something is wrong with the activity tab. Doesn't show transaction. But when you go to friends tab and click on a friends, it shows all the details. Happening with all my friends for the same transactions! Some are visible in activity tab, some aren't! Fix it please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the latest update, the app is not responding. No elements in the app is clickable. I am not able to see the details nor able to add/update/delete any records. Please get it resolved soon."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Mistake in calculation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app developers are unable to send me an update to fix a bug . Inspite of sending numerous mails nothing has been done ."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is crashing again again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice app for frds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Okay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"hang... stick to last page. app run smooth initially but after update app stick to one page not moving just hang. no option works......its better to have older version than this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Edit: 'Spending over time' shows only past 6months. Would be beneficial to scroll and view the totals for the previous months and years ... Please add this! Previous comment: Request to have 'totals' for the past month and year. It would be great to focus the app as a personal finance tracker as well - an Investment category and a separate one for managing loans. Keep up the work 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's really 👍."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hangs after login after new update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Started liking until frozen.. I kind of started to liking this with basic functions that I was testing about and getting my friends in this app. All of a sudden, the app got frozen on my android phone with no error message or warning.. I'm going to uninstall and reinstall it to see whether I can get it up and running again."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App.... Saved lots of transactions and time..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"After new update it is hang in the first page, if once again open it is working, pls check and update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's good. But, calculations are mismatched."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't describe how much I absolutely hate this application, it's easily the most disliked item on my phone is now removed. Splitwise wants you to do things its way, and is extremely intolerant and utterly disinterested in you wishing to buck that trend. Do you want to simply calculate a bill division? Pick another app, because you can't with Splitwise unless you fill in the contact details for everyone in your group. Don't want to? Tough"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Multifactor authentication not yet a feature! Essential for any login, expect when dealing with sensitive financial information."

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent, there are so many realtime features. The one important feature is missing is ""there is no option to set automatic reminder to a group member if he owes something."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is the best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please add features: Estimate Expense, Advance payment for the total expense. Ex: I was planning for a group trip, and collected some amount from all members. Now I want to add expense for Room booking, and I gave some advance amount for booking to hotel. So there should be feature to add such expenses which are estimated and yet not completed or paid completely. By the way, thanks for making this app. Happy to use it. ✌🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful app."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Solid app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app to keep tally on shared expenses among multiple people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not that great for what it claims to be, which is tracking bills and expenses shared between housemates. Instead it lumps debts as a whole, so if I pay for one bill and my housemate pays another, the amounts we both owe to both bills are, as it assumes that paying one bill clears your debt of another. It's actually really annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is crystal clear. Very user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely Useful App. This app has saved me a lot of time in terms of financial calculations. Kudos to the team!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A very good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is not dividing expenses decently... We are three people in a group it is dividing between only 2... Please fix this bug"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and check hw much we hv used and who owns us how much ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Calculation is not at all correct. Settle up is not showing the amount properly. It's messed up. Ended up doing manual calculation instead of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bohot bakwaas Application hain.Pehle dosto ko paise return nahi karne padtey the woh bhool jaatey the but ab nahi bhooltey.Worst discovery of Mankind."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful App to keep track of expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not a friendly app. Cannot change friends email or no import expenses option. App is is only partially useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Effective app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No Cash App support - and don't plan on supporting it"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I did a overseas group trip earlier this year, I gave up doing group trip after that as managing money was hectic, recently Google ads showed up this app, I installed. group trips resumed, seamless and smooth, I wish they integrate UPI. Keep it up team splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really amazing app. Very user friendly ui. I just wanted to have the ability for my friends to have nick names."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app amongst all the app i came accross."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ottima applicazione per dividere le spese, valutate di integrarla con Paypal o altri servizi che permettano di effettuare i pagamenti direttamente dall'app, sarebbe perfetta."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and most useful app. .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works smooth. User interface is near and simple."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice aap to share equally money to our friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really love it. So easy to keep track on who owns who what and when. Very intuitive and simple to use and you can even keep track on your own spending."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 5 years on trips and it is an ingenious app, bravo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app that makes life easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a cool app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Crashes at expense adding. Useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for shared stuff to manage. Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No ads"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very nice app, I would have given 5 stars if the Pro pricing was reasonable, the Pro features are nice to have but not essential, however with a proper discount I would go for the Pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool to track expenses! Would like to have an additional feature of closing accounts as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must use this app if you're on a tour with your friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's really good concept that helped us on tallying our group expenses effectively with out any confusions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for users to track their money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It is crashing, getting the prompt that app has a bug."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing time and peace of mind saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"We 4 strangers live together in a pg.. we started using split wise.. i paid for most things.. for some reason this app only shows what two people owe me.. instead it should have shown all 3 other members who owed me money.. this app has a bug"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to split and maintain accounts. Would be great if it can have ability to read SMS (of course, optional) and update payments to settle up automatically"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app I am using this app since last 4years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use app with every everyday use features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful app to calculate group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Aswme app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good initiative . And easy to manage bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app is great. However, most of the times when in a group, no one wants to go through the rocess of downloading and accepting the permission to join. I hope new updates brings an option to add group members with out adding their phone numbers. That was all calculations can be done and seen in one person's app itself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app has lot of glitches. Transactions aren't been updated accurately. I've found amount mismatch in few transactions. Needs to fix the bugs, else difficult rely on this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"All the calculations are totally wrong. I'm lenting and the app says I'm in debt. If zero stars was an option i would give this app 0 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very user friendly and very convenient to everyone. I strongly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its impossible to link accounts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is a great tool but the recent feature to adjust payments to reduce transaction is difficult to understand for most people. The benefit of the feature is perhaps 10% less transaction but far more confusion. I switch the feature off for my groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app. We can add any amount to split also possible to split indifferently. There is also option of simplify debit, I personally don't like as it creates confusion among people, but if people known how it works & all people in group are OK, this is one of the good option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's so slow to update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy, free and capable of useful features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app works great for groups IF, and it's a big if, absolutely everyone in the group is part of the expense. It has happened a few times now where one person in the group is not part of an expense and that person is still calculated as part of the expense even though I explicitly excluded the person. If this bug is fixed I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Sometimes it doesn't synchronize the data although it is connected to internet, very disturbing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for managing transactions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Eliminated relationship fights and makes splitting shared costs for trips and other life events a breeze"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for tracking house finances. Me and my boyfriend use it to track reoccurring monthly costs that we split."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome expenses control app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best for group share..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"New update has bugs. I can't see the groups I am part off and their expense updates. All I can see are the notifications. This needs to be fixed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Good app for keeping my accounts but the major setback is I forgot my password and even after I submitted my number for password recovery the app doesn't sends me message to change my password (for recovery)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and so helpful for splitting bills!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So much useful and simple"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"first user experience is very poor need update application asap"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It doesn't settle off for all the members in the group. Be careful while using it. NOT RECOMMENDED."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's best financial management app among friends. It quite easy and friendly in usage. always shows and record my monthly expenses and debt via email too on monthly basis. I have using this app around 4 years. And I strongly recommend this app to everyone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love to drop expenditure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Helps everyone a lot"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Horrible, u can't remove anyone, even if u added someone by the same name by mistake until they settle up, lol...hope u don't have a popular name like Julie"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Expenses splited in the group are not displaying. Not just with me, but with others as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Toxic app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and useful to manage your expenses. Must have app in your phone!!! Thankful to have been introduced to this app. ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Now I need friends who return money on time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to track all your expenses. It helps a lot in group expences a lot and is very flexible and well designed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to keep a track. Using since 2017"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate owing money to people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works. Perfect for group travels."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful for tracking group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful, Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"One basic featurebis missing which is debit shuffle.. this will help to settle up with less people.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't add friends without email"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is good. But there is not an option to get category wise amount. I had been for a trip and i wanted to know how much fuel amount is consumed and i couldnt get the option to find out total amount spent on fuel instead i was getting how much I owe or my friends owe me. Except that everything else is good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I really love this App, is super helpfull. Just saying ""please pay u and put it on splitwize"" is priceless, I just made a trip with 20 people super easy. However, some of them didn't understod how to use the app, so sadly we have group leaders to manage splitwize for them. I believe the thing was that the app uses the phone language so some of them had it on english but didn't understand some expressions like settle up. It would be helpfull to have a setup for it. Can be rude but it is w it is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty damn good. Can't really fault it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like it very much. Best app for the hosteler, living together, students and small event organisers. It will use full for split the room expenses amount to all room members according to the payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very nice app for split expenses.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Intuitive. Lovely."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's one very helpful app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for a while now, and it's my most favorite app to track shared group expenses. Easy to use and clean, simple straightforward design!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to split bills with a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The idea behind the app is interesting but it is poorly implemented. First issue is all expenses are shown in $ which is misleading because for someone in Australia, Canada or other countries where the currency is dollar, you assume it is showing your local dollar but it is actually US dollar which is so irrelevant and random. The second issue is everytime a new friend joins the group and adds their expenses all the previous expenses need to be updated one by one so the new friends are included."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"found glich in app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using From Last Five Years....Thanks to developer for making this fabulous app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for dividing household bills and making sure one person doesn't pay too much more than the other"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplifies my experience traveling with friends! Makes trips easier and convenient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app for roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"ببرنامج رائع في مشاركة المصروفات"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super handy app if you have a group of friends that do a lot of stuff together. Also quite a handy app to keep track of your debt with a person. It doesn't necessarily have to be used with groups of people, you can also just make a new group containing only one person. Be sure to check the box for smart calculation. Then it automatically calculates everything in the most efficient way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"High utility"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Extremely useful on trips with large groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app ☺️👍 very usefull for students and roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I don't leave reviews for apps. This is such an amazing app and makes splitting up complicated group trave expences fair, quick and easy. Wish I would have thought of building this app years ago. Highly recommend! 6 of 5 stars!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Initially with 7 people this app worked so good. After adding 2 more people, calculations and not showing proper settle up results and feeling chaotic. Hope this bug will sort asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great and has all features I might need"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Never knew it is so simple ....loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for a family trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app. But can be integrated with more and better features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app,it's so easy to maintain transaction for which I left my diary, a headache & a waste of time too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Need Seperate section for loan given to individual person or any institution. This include option for interest at which loan is given to individual or intrest free, period (Day/week/month/year) for which it is given, due date, due date reminder to both parties via sms or app notifications, credit entry and many more.. this will be useful especially in asian countries...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I want to turn of the simplify debitss"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Annoying to keep adding emails for new people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Awful, if the email of a person is incorrectly added, cannot delete the expense and the balances ore therefore off, waste of time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolute gem"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Ismein category customise karne ka option Hona chahie aur aur daily aur weekly kharch ka vivaran dikhna chahie"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I love the app since it helps to manage group expenses like a breeze! But lately I am unable to view the group I created myself. It says I don't have the permission to access this group. Don't know what to do about that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful this app, I like it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic Application. Once you know How to use, you can use it like anything. I'm using it for nearly 5 Years. It is a sick App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Got me really confused there for a second, but it works great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's really a helpful app. If we enter the expenses correctly it's very easy and helpful. especially to split expenses in a group where more members are sharing different amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastico! It's so easy to manage group spendings with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you specify what accounts you have to accept payments. Always suggests people pay me with Venmo, which I don't use, so their money gets tied up for a couple days before they get it back. Splitwise must get a cut from trying to get people to sign up for Venmo or something."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Everything it goes, it goes right"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I love the app and use it a lot. Just one thing I dearly miss: The splitwise website allows you to record a cash payment with any payer, while the app's ""settle up"" only records a payment from the side that owes money!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding Phone / email should not be a compulsion each time. They are just stealing data. Prefer other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst app ever used"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application. Helps to track your spending precisely."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I just wanted a simple App. Why is it compulsory to add phone numbers and email.? Why do u want to notify them?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Suggestion: The app should ask for confirmation from the payer when the payee uses the ""settle up"" option."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Simple but wonderful app. Does exactly what it says and no extra hassle. Setup is effortless and can start using the app without any learning curve."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very help full for roommates...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplifies micro transaction very efficiently"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I would give it 6 out of 5 if I could... Love the wide array of features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! It simplified the group trip I just had with my friends. So easy to use and very well tracking and distribution of per head expense share. Kudos to Splitwise team!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not showing all split"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is very useful App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for financial managment of vications. Easy balanse and spending reports. Had fun using it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app not showing proper expenses because of this app we friends are fighting with each other"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not receiving notifications in android if someone add an expense in group or in personal."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Proved to be really handy for sorting food/drink expenses on a recent holiday"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't really keep a good account and shows wrong person in the group when it comes to settling up the balances. I wouldn't trust the numbers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app suddenly stopped working and not allowing me to login and resting the password. It's saying forbidden access, tried with multiple network as well. Not able to access the data."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good. The paid version is a bit expensive and subscription only. I'm still using the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for recording expenses and spliting it with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever. The interface is for aliens not for humans. Every single person needs to create their own group. Worst app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Once all expenses are inputted, the following needs to be done - - settle up should be a two way process. Both parties must press it for it to work - each member should be able to see just their own expenses as well, otherwise they cannot cross check in a sea of group expenses. Its too chaotic. - when we go to check balances, the only balances it shows are the ones it has calculated as final 'who gives what to whom'. But if someone has already made even a single part of the payment, its messy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good for shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app helped me and my roommate keep our numbers clear. It helped me in many trips with the splits and playments. I highly recommend this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app Has made my life really easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I gave 5 rating yesterday. Group Expenses are not updating. I caught into fight with my friends coz of this and i lost 5000 rs coz of this. Hire me if you cannot implement the logic properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Lifesaver. Every friend I recommend it to, falls in love. Can't do trips without it anymore!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app its make your debt and owe in a very great manner"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good app but I hate that it needs a valid email for group members, I hate that I need to create an account to use it, etc. I understand why that's why the app is that way but that doesn't mean the option to use it without those features shouldn't be available at all. Your app would be way better for having those features. Take Splid for example."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best aap ever used"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for Money share, among group of people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't split well and notifications are wrong. Also payment option is a big failure"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to split things in a large group. Would 10/10 recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, extremely helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb bifurcation strategy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitwise is a very beautiful and useful app. It makes the trip expense tracking easy and non combersome. Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise is a good app to keep track of your expenses and also for balance settlement between friends."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helps making life less complicated!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Shows wrong calculations. I'm paying someone else bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Some of the rare apps that I rate. The best, OG."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life changing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to handle expenses between friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group expenditure sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is not getting updated even after uploading 3-4 times.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Here is a feedback- there should be a month wise report for individual to check the expenditure every month."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have app, UI, navigation are very good & features are useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Ended up subscribing to pro version. I'd a good way to keep track of exoenses as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, excellent!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy way to slpit bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply but effective"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice and useful app👌🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Messed everything up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app reminds others about the old payments they made. This app is enough to make your pocket empty."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The reciever of the money should be able to settle up the expenses not the one who is giving. Also the app shows some unnecessary expenses and more amount but when the calculation is opened the right amount is shown."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app but there are some missing things that you have to add"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Difficult to understand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best part is bunnies 🐰"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's so super and awesome."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It just makes our trips with friends simpler"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Multiple groups, multiple currencies. So helpful in so many situations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple, functional, perfect"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am really impressed by this app. I was looking for such app since long time. Happy to find this app that solved my long standing issue of calculating expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Needs to be improved settlement calculations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Like the app,time saver, couldn't get better."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is a must, very intuitive and clean design"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very much user friendly. Loving it.😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to install"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall good experience Easy to manage daily expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If there would have been option to give thousand stars, I would have given this app all of those. Best app, best at what it does."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of my favourite apps! Such a time saver. Ideal for group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really great app on tracking all the expenses especially when people live together all expenses get messy. This app helps break down that and gives proper accountability on how much money to send/receive. Thanks Splitwise for all your help!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to settle expenses with others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Still great to use. Helpful and easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, used on multiple travels with friends. Well done guys!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. It makes life easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best of the century!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"More than useful. 4 of us friends share our flat and we use it every day to split all of our expenses. It's easy to use and pro like at the same time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"UPDATED: 1-star rating (back down again). Now that I have returned from my group trip, I can now determine it is a lousy app with a broken algorithm. I could not recommend this to anyone. Conceptually nice with horrible execution. A simple spreadsheet will do just fine.😵"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant app. Just wish the pro version wasn't so expensive for occasional users as currency conversion would be helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Would be nice to see expense statistics such as some Personal Expense tracking apps have, splitting expenses by food, travel, etc, reading inputs from SMS."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good and hassle-free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes lofe simple!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's awesome... It's a great tool for free and keeps your data synced even if you lost your Mobile or switch to a different phone. Attachments can be improved. Also if they can add a mechanism to export and share the records details that will be great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Useful App For Sharing Expenses. Simple UI. Easy-to-use. Get Rid Of Manual Entries, I Recommend To Download This App For Group Tours."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Looks great but you should implement the option to add bank details. So we could straight away pay or recieve money without the need to manually transfer money through our bank app. Also there is no option to add anywhere your bank details on your profile so your friends could see it easily and transfer the money as they can't do it through your app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Suddenly all expenses gets messed up with roommates expenses which is not showing incorrectly try to connect support not received any kind of revert"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and full of features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good app even in free version! I always use it when I need to split expenses between us. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No option for delete or remove"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to divet up among rent and otger things with roommates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Every time I try to login the app *instantly* says ""Error. The internet connection seems to be offline."", despite the fact that I'm on a great Internet connection (that I'm using to write this review!). Great app normally but something seems really broken here - it's like the app has decided that I'm offline and now won't even try to make a network request before showing me errors."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mast app h install karne k baad pata chala itna kharcha hota h 😥😥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great all for room mates with out worry highly appreciated & recommend to everyone who is in sharing room"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It made things more difficult to keep up with, honestly. They don't have an option to settle individual expenses within a group, so the total amount owed becomes useless if even one friend pays you back for say, a single large expense that they didn't want to put off. There's no way to tell the app that that one expense has been paid, so you have no choice but to calculate everything yourself after that. It's nice that there's a log, but there's probably better, more comprehensive apps out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app, loving it. They should enable permission control, to control expense deletion permission control."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app that makes splitting expenses a breeze. We used this for vacation trip with friends and it made everything very transparent. I do wish the Pro version was cheaper per year as I think 30 per year is a little high."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very nice app especially for Trips with friends and Shared flats. It would be nice if we can add read-only users and Option to add negative amount which will help to distribute the prize money or lottery."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app, but since i logout yesterday a cant login again, everytime says ""forbidden"", i tried login on the website and works ok, i dont know what to do to fix this. Now i cant use this wonderful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. I would just add the ability to merge people in groups. Me and my GF don't care who spends between us. But we still need to add ourselves to groups separately so the equal split still works. Split wise should allow me and her to owe as 1 but count as 2 when adding expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"SplitWise is not working well and showing so much errors"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful and helpful app for managing budget on trips. Just wanted to know, how to delete old transaction activity from splitwise even after I deteled that particular trip? Pls suggest"

"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Bought the pro version but the Scan receipt is not working. Just showing the move closer prompt."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"❤️❤️❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This app is horrible! Never makes sense and it is not easy to track."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very effective"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Pointless if you can't send money directly through the app like you can with others. Just use your standard issue calculator."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Super useful app. But it would be perfect if the Plates by Splitwise app is built into this app and also to include a calculator so that I dont have to leave the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for students we can use in trip and hostel in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app for friends who shares the expenses."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App made our weekend with friends so easy to manage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Crazy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app for keeping daily base expense records."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice aap for room partner or tour or other uses after use 1 year"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Embarrassing effort at producing an app. Truly awful. Avoid at all costs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless unless you pay for premium . Doesn't net out currencies. This used to be free. Now you have to subscribe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"चिल्लर गोष्टीचा पण हिशेब ठेवता येतो 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a awesome app for managing expenses with groups and its simplest UI and functionalities was so good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice App very usefull"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Too good... very practical. Must for every home/groups to record and divide payment correctly with no ambiguity. Simple and user friendly.. all possible angles have been thought in making of this app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is a wonderful app but give us the option to turn off dark mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Where has this been all my life?! This app is awesome. Makes expense tracking so much easier between multiple people. The simplify debts feature is a godsend when used properly. Easy-to-use and engaging design."

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app for accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is no colour availablity, what's the issue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I used this app more a few years back, and now only have it to keep track of some unsettled accounts. Now one of them suddenly disappeared, and checking the activity panel, I found: '**** removed you from their friends list. They owed you *,***.**.' Why would the app just delete an unsettled bill without notification?! Seems as ridiculous as that it was not able to calculate fractions correctly, a few years back. Not sure if it does it correctly now - have not checked."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Honestly it was very helpful. Thank you dear developers. I hope the reward of your work comes back to you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tried to buy pro, deducted 2rs from bank account, but pro didnt get activated. Did it will 2 cards, and one says autopay of 499 per year is setup but I have no pro. I understand that this might be an issue of google play payments, but I have no other means to complain/ get help for this situation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"BUNNIES!!! ✨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent.highly satisfied"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It is a very useful app. But this should have options to transfer money via UPI. Then it would be the best app with 5 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Shashank Shukla"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty innovative and helpful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Drawback : In a group of 3 say A, B, C... Settlement is possible between A to B or A to C as A is the admin. But settlement is not possible between B and C. Unable to fetch the total expenses of the individuals A, B, C. This is not at all useful for group where other's expenditure is larger then the admin. And settlement is required within the other members of the group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The perfect app for trips with your friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool to automatically split expenses during group activities"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No ads, good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doest not calculate properly."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App i have ever seen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Greatttttt"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly useful and light"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made splitting bills very easy. Good job"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If Some one is paying manually not through the app there is an option for manual settle ment But one can clear the settle up without actual transfer of any money nor the cash not online but still the payment gets cleared There need to be a verification between the payer and the reciever regarding the same. This loop hole needs to be cleared This reduces the reliability of the application One can't relly on it completely having blind faith might cost valuable amount of money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for splitting money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate that people can pay you on splitwise and it takes 3-5 business days for it to get into your account. What year is this 2002?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app does the job. There is room for UI modernization but as of now looks simple which is good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is trash. People owe each other at random. Nothing correlates to an expense. I made an expense where everyone in the group owes me money and instead they owe someone else. I deleted that expense, everyone in the group owes that person more money for no reason. If it can't coordinate money, it's entire purpose has failed. Don't use this. Use a paper and pen, much more useful than this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it! No more money arguments about who payed what in our household. The options for splitting payments different ways are perfect! I haven't used the payments directly in the app because we all use weird banks but it definitely helps keep track of things!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm still working with the free version and love it for weekend trips with friends or keeping track of construction costs while renovating. I rarely write reviews but am happy to take the time for this one. I feel so relieved. The bills from my endless renovation are finally tallied and split between all parties in a way that is easy to understand for the average smartphone owner. Happy user!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is extremely useful...but just felt in case of a group, summary of each person's expense share keeping aside what is due will help in analysis."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very helpful. Just a small suggestion, it would be much helpful if it gave an export option for all your expenses combined for a whole month. Similarly, for the totals tab. It will help us in keeping track of monthly expenses instead of opening each and every group and then adding them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"helpful for financially saving persons and normal People who are interested in sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to reset password using phone number."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for expenses held in groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the greatest app ever made... Thank you for this gem❤"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its easier and effective application.Thank Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Unable to remove the old groups from splitwise. And also unable to remove friends from the friends list. Hence, I am giving this. Otherwise, I will give 5 out of 5. I found 2 flaws in splitwise which are not good for few of them. Thanks for the App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage expenses of trips."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Decent app. Serves the purpose"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very useful. Perhaps calculator support when adding expenses would add to it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and handy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really handy. Would like to see two changes: 1. Have an option of seeing the percentage of the catagories of expenses. 2. Would love to see an option for standard valuta. I don't like that with pro charts, I have to always go to the setting to put in into euros. It should be standard (optional). Edit: also pro is way too expensive. Give us a one time purchase. That should be more than fair with the currently very limited features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app super useful and easy for group trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Despite entering the correct amount and split 7 times it still shows an incorrect calculation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best splitter app ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The help desk resolved my issue very quickly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So simple and easy...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If a tansaction fails to sync with the server it results in an ugly error that's there permanently in your groups transaction history.. why can't I delete it?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"sadela experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So far I like it. Simplify feature is a blessing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Has to be one of the most useful apps I've ever used. The simplify debts feature is just amazing!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app saves friendships 🤣👍🏼"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Calculations are wrong. Calculations don't match. Please fix it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's the most well designed, intuitive and helpful application I have come across. I sometimes decide on whether to engage with someone based on their ability to use this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Splitting bills had never been this easy!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't open up. Please fix the bugs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really great app that allows you to track expenses between a group. Allows you to share equally, by percentage, or by specific amounts among any number of your group. You can also pay each other in app. Super awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app and easy to work on it. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App crashes when trying to open."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Even the free version provides an excellent experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app 🤩"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Definitely an indispensable app now. It makes me life easier with my ex wife and child expenses, stag dos, parties, events. Everyone I know loves this app when I introduce them to it. Definitely a game changer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome app but giving 4 star because every time I have to change currency from dollars to rupees it should automatically detect the currency according to the location."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best split wise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is such a perfect app for group travel or anything where you want to split expenses! So many options, everything I want to do is here!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Simplified payment can still be improved.... Why i have to pay $150 to person A and at the same time he pays me back $30 ?! It would be easier of I paid him $120 and we are even."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is a nice app which is easy share our money amoung our friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really loved this app ,it made everything simple . Very easy and user friendly. Free to use it.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This makes paying the bill with friends extremely easy. I recommend this app to everyone."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for an year now. The UI is very user-friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"A very good app to track spending with groups or SO. At its free state it already offers everything I need i.e. to split the bills with my SO. Due how well this has been working I might consider subscribing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Great when traveling with friends or just for the usual suspects when socializing. Would love a way to enter expenses as you would read them off an itemized receipt and add you enter the line items you assign them to ppl. Rather than needing to tally up the total per person and enter. (And yes, we tend to go Dutch)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app to keep track of common expenses with my room mates for years now. Simple and extremely useful. Highly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ĺove this app. Makes sharing expenses super easy and in real-time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app tricks the sender to think the receiver has Venmo/PayPal,while it is not always true. Cause people need to resend/cancel the payment. Also the app never confirmed with the receiver the email they are using for payment method. Sometimes the email used to register for splitwise is not the same as their PayPal/Venmo account. This cause a lot of trouble and communication required. Not user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"What's the use of this app now??? Since WhatsApp has come up with UPI payments in group message now🤷🏻‍♂️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App!! Highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Everything at ease😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really well made, I already organized 5 trips with this app and made everyone of my friends download it so none could get confused. We are all satisfied, the app is amazing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splid is a better app because no username and password is required to use the app. It also balances all the expenses and provides it in PDF which is practical for users"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful. Just loved it durint my last trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. Still I wonder why the developers are not adding other payment options like UPI apart grom Paytm transfer to settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best application one can have for every trip, for daily expenses and much more. Don't know how will I manage my expenses without it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app solved the problems of roommates and saved various fight. Thank you 😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent - but stubborn into notifying others about adding them to group. We find it annoying receiving messages all the time. Please enter option to not notify others about being added to group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must application in mobile 🤘"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"You cant find a better app. Makes life very easy! - Software Engineer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great aap. Have been using it for year now."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Indispensable"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This app is genius. My sister in law is getting married and we used splitwise for the bach party. We're currently using it for the bridal shower as well. I wish there was a way to hold a person's place without needing their phone number or email. I purposely didn't send the invite texts because we don't know the final head count for the shower so we can't add the food cost yet. The app randomly sent a text all on its own saying I invited them to the group. Super awkward cause I need more money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Add Ukrainian localization please"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Kya faida friends phir bhi paise nahi dete 😔😔😔😔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a very very usefull and important app if a group is planning something"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its ridiculous that a basic search feature is available on subscription. Old feedback It would be great if 1. there is a moving option or expense copy/cut paste option 2. day shows along with date 3.there is option to select payment mode like credit card, debit card, cash etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It would have been great if the app is directly linked with the upi id of the individual and their friends to automate the entries and accounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Beautifully simple and simply beautiful. Wish I had this 10 years ago."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good features. Very easy to handle finances, especially when splitting in groups. In other words 'WAAHH BHURAA WAAHH'😂."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hey guys can you plzz add calculator in the app. Thank me later."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty useful for trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great App, but the pro version pricing is absolutely ridiculous. The charts are really bad and barely useful (can't even get a bar chart for anything before January of the current year) and you're supposed to pay 3€ per month for that. I would suggest making it 3€ once and it would be a fair price for what you get. I'll keep using the free version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Need more simplified UI and user experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Easy tool for Split bills and expenses between your friends, Tours, colleagues etc..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does the job always. Feature suggestion: App being able to read my transactions from sms and create a daily note where I can go review it later & add to my splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Honestly i am fan of this app but ever since we have latest updated version its crashing a lot. It literally crashes every time a new expense is added. Also once you add an expense unless until you restart the app. you don't get option to add another."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I've issues with the app and need immediate help. Is there a Customer Care number or email?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made life so much easier when fund-raising and on holidays with friends recently, not having to worry about who pays for what and who owed who etc. So straightforward and simple, highly recommend this app. 😀"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"As part of a hiking group we travel together and Splitwise makes it easy to keep track of group and sub group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps for vacations with multiple peeps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Do I need one more account to use this app? Uninstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Always good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Genius."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using for almost 3 years now...best app to split bills"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to track all group expenses and final settlements"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app and great attention to detail"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and user friendly even in the free version. Don't bother me with ads, which is nice. I'm considering buying the Premium version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is incredibly useful when travelling and it's very easy to use 5/5"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. Shows you the true nature of people. Friends turn to enemies when it comes to money . Lost many friends due to this app . Anyways great experience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would be great if there was a calculator built into this. It would making splitting the bill so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ease the burden of complex calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and perfect for tracking expenses within a group and settling up afterwards"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A Very convenient application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is crashing when I click on add expenses button Redmi note 11t pro"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app, made our trip so much easier! Just one comment I had and that would be great to have more than one person paying option when using joint credit cards"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They were so many glitches and it made it so hard to know who owe who how much and gets everything messed up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitting calculation is wrong while number of expenses Were add."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Calculation is going wrong when some people of the group is not included inside the group... Calculation is right only when all is included in the transaction.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Crazy app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Use this app daily - is awesome!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Fine. UI needs some serious work though. Try entering an activity without having to redo or edit about 10 times, because the app has decided to randomly change the currency or split the bill when you didn't ask it to. Nice idea, but infuriating!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It makes living with someone else and keeping track of household expenses so much easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an app! Wow! It's really wonderful app for daily splitting of bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can't pay through the app. Says i need to verify my account but it gives no instructions on how to do that. Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life eeeeasy"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super convenient way to split expenses when traveling with others, wish I would've had this years ago."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app and company are awesome! It saves me so much time for tracking joint as well as personal expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to use this app for a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Way to complicated to use. Quicker to just split the bill and pay separately. Seems like an APP looking for a non existent problem to solve."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing!!! Saves us so much time and headaches in using excel to calculate our group expenses. Simple and easy for everyone to follow. I'm in love 😍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app to note daily expense and to split between friends.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works very well. Easy to use, nice UI and overall good experience. Can recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"shitiest app ever ...u try to log in or sign in or et evr ....it just keep on loading the page but the page nvr show up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"But how to add one dummy friend in the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good app but you have to sacrifice your privacy. THEY CAN ACCESS YOUR CONTACT AND ALSO MAKE A COPY OF IT. Careful if you are not interested don't use this. There are many other expenses manager apps that doesn't take your data. DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO PRO at any cost, in the name of chart they just issue bar graph that's useless. 500/ yr Is totally waste"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"All seems well until it's time to settle up, then balances go awry. My group had to settle up as non-group expenses for everything to zero out properly. Also, using non-group expenses does not allow you to see what EVERYone owes/is due...only the people you owe and what is owed to you. That's annoying."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app while we are splitting for a trip or we are flatmates etc....loved it❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saved a huge ton of calculating nd keeping track of balances. I hope to see a place where you could keep records of individual expenses as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I really love this application. Specifically, it is useful during tours with your friends. You don't have to worry about your remaining budget and how much you owes or how much you get back from others. It calculates everything even in free mode."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I didn't find how to add one expense paid with installments (e.g. flight tickets, hotels). Is it there and i didn't found it? If I'm wrong, please show me how i do it easily. Or maybe you didn't predicted this feature because it is not usual, but in countries where the flight is so expensive like Brazil, this do EXTREMELY common. But i can say that this app is very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app to review expenses. I like the export feature and it is very easy to track it in Excel."

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Just assumes your Venmo email is the same. No account linking, no verification, no nothing. The result is, it's really easy to sign up and have friends send money to the wrong email, and you'll be none the wiser. I've never experienced a company using your login email as the assumed login for other, unaffiliated accounts. Kinda insane that a money company would be this flippant, esp. given this has been brought up for years. Makes me very concerned about their security..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have used this app for more than a decade with many people in my life. It is a great way to not talk about money. It puts the onus on group members to track their own expenses. That way if Bob feels like Susan is not pulling her financial weight, but the app does not show a balance, it is probably Bob's fault for not tracking his expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Owesome. Concept coming to reality."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My partner and I installed Splitwise four months ago and found it to be the perfect option for us. You've got a lot of options, even on the free version - different ways to split, date functions, tracking your numbers. It fulfills all of our needs and keeps our home running smoothly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplified Expenses Tracking. Must have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pretty poor. Cant add categories and the CSV extract is extremely bad, hard to figure out who owns what and doesnt fully match the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Only thing I see missing, or could be added is a payment gateway."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome simplification"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app to settle group money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is good but I hope we can add a mobile number on our profile which can be seen by friends or to post a note on a group with all our numbers. This is our way of paying balances. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Clunky. Forces you to use Venmo which has been proven to be insecure and there is no admin of the group so anyone in a group can change anything or even delete the group. They need Zelle as an option to pay others back but they get a kickback from PayPal I assume so that feature isn't coming any time soon"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to use when you always spend your money for a group of people. It will split and provide the track of your spends. Best one for bachelors."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very nice app for sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"If Transaction wise settlement is available it will be best. To keep track of which settlement is for which transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Add an option to delete activity. I did open few split for trial purpose. But those are still showing up on my ""activity tab"". So Do add a delete option there."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Was really a great experience with this. As we were studying in university and going out with friends, and then on the table everyone has to pay their money, and if someone doesn't have on the spot, someone else would pay at that time and then adjusting it later on was really a messy thing. But while using this app, now we are in our professional life but still we have friends with whom we eat on daily basis. But trust me, not everyone has to pay on spot. One person pays the bill, good to go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app...so convenient to use among friends,relatives .."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you have Venmo as default option for settlement? My friends have tried sending money through Venmo because of it. I don't even have an account. There is no way for it to not show up on the settle screen. I don't want to link any of my payment accounts to Splitwise. If you're going to push products, provide an option to opt out and not just set it as default payment method. There was a thread in 2017 about this and still no resolution."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"J Lalu Lohar"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App. Have been using it for years, about 30 trips now. It does take some getting used to as there are some idiosyncrasies as to how you set it up. But after that its a real breeze. I really like how it minimizes the number of checks/payments you have to make to settle up. I really like it for group dynamics. It makes group bills easy. Someone just picks it up and it goes into the SplitWise account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please add more ways for settling repayments. For example, for Canadian users, please add support for Interac e-transfer between Canadian banks and Canadian credit unions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for shared expenses with friends. We use it for all our holidays together. I think it's the best app in this category."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect companion for group kitty's. Simple and intuitive to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application! A must for a trip with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Damn cool app....lets you keep all the records perfectly and then divides its for you as you want it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best ever app for managing expenses between friends. Totally changed my life from maintaining excel sheets and notepad to hassle free record management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app. Helping us a lot in managing room expenses in a shared rented building."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Too many bugs there are lots of error in splitting. If possible can I know how to contact someone about the bugs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was enjoying this app in first month and my team was dependent on this thing. Before we are spliting our expenses in all members equally but issue arisen when we are adding our expenses with particular member. We found some kind of bug or anything like its calcution is wrong. Kindly check it. It's creating trust issue on your App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great to keep track of shared costs e.g. on trips, night outs, bills etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"app is good ,you just need to add approve option whenever there is a payment recorded or any thing recorded"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing !!! A good suggestion for developers that make this app an online payment app. Add payment options in app where we are settling up our bills. It will be easy for users to not to go in other app to pay money and then come back splitwise to update settlement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to manage"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Actually everything is ok but problem will come during settle time, borrower settled the amount without asking lender , So my suggestion is if borrower settled that time one message will reach to lender if he approves then total amount will be settled up. Please update this for latest version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Critically thought all the scenerio and Well executed the application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app. It will calculates and split the expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What a convenient app. Definitely saves up time computing for the splits during trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is great as I managed my small expenses within my family and friends and track the sharing of expenses easily. It helps to keep a track who pays whom and how much I owe from/to others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Need to make this to add catogery of payment and try to show analysis for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Could you perhaps add a feature to add expenses after every set number of days instead of just the usual pre defined periods? Some monthly payment services such as Netflix and YouTube Premium often subscribe for 30 days which results in subsequent payments being added to splitwise with a few days offset. Just a suggestion. Other than that, no complaints and great job guys!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!! The major flaw in this app is that it ASSUMES you have a Venmo account and will give people the option of paying you back via Venmo and autofill info for a Venmo account with whatever email you used to sign up to Splitwise with. This led to a ton of awkward conversations with everyone involved in my party as I had to have them reverse the payments made to the non-existent Venmo account and Zelle me. Would not recommend!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If I could rate negative stars I would. The app is confusing and sends endless notifications about nothing. Absolutely 💯 worthless app. Never download this or sign up. Never. Period."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app for group trips!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, no adds,.simple and so easy to explain to people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for 10 years and it really made so much easier doing trips with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"need to give contact details of everyone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Honestly a very very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't enjoy that it automatically ""connects"" to venmo or PayPal without access to someone's actual email and won't let me add my cash app names."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is a problem i feel in this Application i.e. if I mention the calculations of the money spent with my friend, then my friend can also be able to edit or delete it. Which shouldn't happen because after a lot of calculations, if my friend can delete the following calculations of money not all But if he deletes a little?? If he does, what will I do after that? That's why I am giving 2 rating to this application, everything else is good But this one only...🤮🤮 Which you can't egnore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best expenses tracking application out there. It's basically an expense split app among friends, but does come with a lot of extra required features. It doesn't ask any personal info of yours, like social. And even doesn't track your credit cards or bank accounts. If you live with more than 1, go to multiple place with different people, and wanna save your time from splitting bills and getting embarrassed by asking for your money back, then definitely this is THE app for you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is good but i feel it needs improvement. 1st Once i add expense to someone's account and the prsn is liable to oay me, he should immediately get a popup to pay me the money. Also there should be notification to repay the money every 2 hrs which the prsn can't turn off. 2nd app should be connected to upi or something so that when person pays the money through splitwise, it automatically changes to settled and msg should popup to receiver that money received. I hope we see these changes!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app, just try it for a minute and you'll see."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's used to be much better few years back, I logged in after 2 years it is so confusing and doesn't provide simplied information. I am already searching for another app to replace this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for shared payment between family, or travel group the best about it at the end of your trip you can track all expenses and generate excel"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. It has me the hassle of splitting on shared expenses with my friends and roommates. Its just very easy to use and intuitive, love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it to track expenses with my friends as well as to track expenses of my house building contractor. However, I feel a much needed feature would be great to have. i.e. Ability for adding 3rd person to the group as a read-only user who is not part of the transaction but should be just aware of the expenses between other people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"You can only add people from your contact list and after it ask to send notification via SMS to the mentioned contacts and there is no possibility to opt out , I uninstalled immediately without accepting to send the notification cut the app still sent the notification to the people. Ridiculous approach."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The caclculations are apparantly getting wrong in the group, I am asked to send amount to wrong person causing one person to lose their share. Its must be a bug!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A perfect app for bachelors to record their group expenses.. Interface was so good and user-friendly.. I think one doesn't required premium version of this App as all the core features available in the free version itself"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must app for travelling"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done, no bugs. Ads for pro version are slightly annoying but it's still 5 stars"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient when going out with friends and sharing the expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not great. When people join the group it just adds a new person instead of joining as somebody you said was in it before. Can't remove someone from the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Changed to Splitwise from (discontinued) tabbt. Does the job well. Missing autocomplete feature, though. When adding new expense and typing a few letter (""bre""), tabbt would offer the text from former expenses (""breadrolls""). Safes time. 5 stars if this works in future version. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App has poor features like I'm unable to make someone in the group an admin and leave group! These changes are the basics."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow"

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The UI is very cluttered and confusing to move around in and see itemized transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is a great app for teenagers. It has been one of the finest banking system specially designed for kids of the coming generation. This banking app has great facilities to offer to its users. I am thankful for having this app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very efficient app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It makes travel with friends nicer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. You should also include prompts to your payment provider and debit the funds to the people you owe. This would be a great feature. Start with m-pesa in Kenya 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't know what is happening in my splitwise app I can't see any group and if I'm creating new group that is also not visible I can't look at any expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Recently we were on trip and decided to use this useless app to track our expenses. Everyone entered there expenses time to time. But what we found after settling up is that,this app is having big error in simple calculations.. This app devided 15921₹ in 6 people as 2970₹ per person... We were shocked by seeing this result.. So don't be dependent on this app ,use other apps which works correctly and they are less complicated... @team splitwise if u want more details feel free to contact me.."

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Nah"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to split spending with friends! Ideal for trips or nights out. Used it last week for the first time on a trip to France with friends. It would be great if the app could also handle multiple currencies, by providing an option to add the exchange rate for a second currency. Our trip had some expenses in £GBP and some in €Euro, so we had to manually convert before adding. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It assigned me many debts in groups I don't know with people I don't know when I typed my email. Terrible thing."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app it helped us a lot during the trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It was an Awesome help while traveling with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I was thinking about an app like this but then found this one. And it does all I need. Pretty much. Should you have to split expenses equally, unequally, by shares, etc. It does all that. I have some other ideas that would work for this kind of app also (public agreements, social ratings, automatic reminders, and some other stuff). I hope they will do it something like I have in my mind."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing on my Vivo X70 Pro. It opened fine the first time on, but post that keeps crashing soon after I open. Tried clearing storage and cache. Gave all required permissions, still crashes. Please fix this or we will have to switch to something stable."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What a great app to manage expenses among friends.. A revolutionary app which has the capability to remove all the hard work of splitting via pen and paper. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for Trips Have used for multiple shared Trips over the past two years. Makes it so easy to determine who owes. Takes away the middle man when there are more than two and the spreadsheets or pieces of paper are gone now too!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gr8 app... If possible could an option be provided for monthy clouse aso that user can choose to view monthly balance or accomulated balance as they find it useful to them."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app..for expense sharing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"it is very confusing in handeling the members, a pending settlement of old group is not letting us remove a member in another group. Plus, it is showing two members in my name, with an unlnown number assigned to it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One the most useful apps ever"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is very stupid if you add a contact from your phone book in a group it will go find an email of that person from their database and replace the user name with the database name. Its is so annoying because peoples name will differ on your phonebook and Splitwise. I don't care what they save as their name it would have been helpful to see them as my contact name."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to work out expenses for a group. Have used on a couple trips now, and it really simplifies what is owed amongst groups and reduces number of payments needed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and proper management of your credit."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is no functionality to just settle 1 item at a time. The only reason I'm still using this app is because 2 friends are on it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using this app to track the expenditure on trips. The app is really useful and we put instantly what expenditure we have done and between whom it should be divided. It keeps note and at the trip end we know how much we owe or how much to take from others. Simple app, easy to use and user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mind blowing app. It solved my all problems with expenses. Great app. Keep it up. I would like to suggest an feature like to add his/her own spendings in the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for keeping all the expenses tracked. Also, the simple features of splitting the money among friends, family etc is really pleasing. Love to use this app. Specially while going on a trip with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's amazing app for spilt actions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please add an option of Calculator in the Numpad which opens up when we enter any amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Comments ux is broken so badly. Massive duplication and crazy scrolls everywhere."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"don't know how this is free, such a good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Hey the app is extremely good but can be improved. For example the area were you split the bills unequally or by adjustment, enabling math calculations would be helpful ( +,-,*,/ ). Charts has a long way to improve. They look cheap take a long time loading and not very useful as well ( this is why i cancelled my premium )"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app... Love it... ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to open Splitwise, worth app never worked for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot get second person shown as a payer for items."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app cyz it jus keeps me away from Math, i always recommend this to my pals cyz this is wat I choose to manage my 💰 money. 5Stars!! #Love"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This App is very good. Although there is one thing Missing that is if person want to add there own personal expenses. To record there monthly expenses. I hope you add this feature in future."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why would you allow people to submit payments to unconfirmed email addresses??? There was a typo and now everything is messy and dumb."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for money tracking with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App Very Useful To track Daily Expenses"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"it is very useful app to keep record of daily expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!! Brilliant!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for money matters !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Feature needed: a reset expenses is needed to delete all transactions once it's settled up"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep your expenses. Need facility to add payment receipt from group member."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for managing group expenses. It sorts life👍👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice design and functionality!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Save time and IT'S Simple UI makes splitting easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use for divide expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It helped to track my budget while in a groups. And also easy to customize the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Needs to be used with people you trust as anyone can change/delete expenses. There should be one admin option, or for everyone to review changes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Without fail one of the best apps I've ever downloaded. I use it a lot when I go on motorcycle trips with 7 or 8 people. Instead of people hiding in the toilet when it's time to pay people are waving their hands saying can I pay can I pay.......! Its quit fun."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app is not compatible in all mobile it crash all time ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The UI is poor, but whats worse is that the app has failed to split our trip expenses as they were not calculated properly between us. This is the only thing you'd expect from money splitting app to do its work and split debts properly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mission accomplished"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't even open and immediately force closes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and practical to use, highly recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Adding People is so complicated. It ask for phone or email. Why its needed. What if expenses is being shared with someone who dont have phone or email. Like kids or elderly people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"iOS version is so pretty, why does android look like dog piss 😢"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"At the start it was great. Until it started to not divide correctly and giving us sums that didn't make sense. There wasn't a cover pages on how each of us owe the money so we couldn't confirm the app was working correct. Multiple problems"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've gone our of my way to rate this app because I genuinely appreciate it so much! Makes my flat Bill's so easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app easy to use 👌simplify debts is a great add on into this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's really useful and good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have been using this since 2017, for bachelor room mates it is a superb app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have use it for years. Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really impressed ✨"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"For tracking balances, it's great. For making payments, it sucks. It automatically defaults the payee to their Splitwise email, which is often not their Venmo or PayPal email, and it does not allow you to override that default. All members of our group had to cancel their payments and make them manually through Venmo. Yes, you can workaround this by adding your Splitwise email as a secondary to Venmo, but it is counterintuitive. They need to add the ability to set the correct ID in your profile"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it! Helped us record and split every cent between four friends as we travelled through Europe. No stress, no fuss."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"INCOMPLETE APP No Income Head & No categories Any expenditures app is incomplete without income heading. Of course you gave the grouping option and good user interface, so a 2 star."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful for splitting expenses between friends and serves the purpose really well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to calculate expenses when travelling in a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app but confusing UI and Poor UX. There is lot of room for UI/UX improvement. ONE WORD: ReallyConfusing. Plz reimagine the interface and UX."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and gets rid of scraps of paper! We sorted the difference by bank transfer when we got home but can't yet see a way of balancing (unless I just make up expenses)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. I enjoy using it. It serves its purpose in the best way possible. Thanks guys!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Some apps deserve 5 starts, and spliwise is one among them. Thank you Splitwise & team for making our lives easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great....no need of admin....easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its a great application. It may not look that much helpful but once we start using this we can understand how simple it makes the things for us."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use even I can use it! I've lost out on so much money because I'm bad at chasing up with people to pay me plus doing the math- I hate it! This app solves all of that for me. I love it!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, was so helpful when paying out lots of different expenses to organise a party."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"expense changes by itself not in a correct way, App has became more buggy, initially it was a great app , Now it forces you to buy premium just to show you things in correct way, very disappointed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app is really helpful in managing group expenses and one-to-one expense records. However with a slight tweaking, the option to review monthy expenses can be added so that user can have a glance and stock of his expenditures. E-mail at end of month are not of much utility. Edited- Given 5 ⭐"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great service. Super useful way to track group tabs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This is SO confusing to use! Why can't the expenses be recorded on a monthly basis without creating a new group every single time & manually adding the members? Also, it shows I owe one of the group members when all of the payments were made by me - which makes no sense! Recording payments messes up all the calculations for some reason!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its a gr8 application to divide money if you going on trip...love this application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Surprised this wasn't done sooner this app keeps track and there no question who owes what"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I cannot open the app. I uninstalled and installed multiple times, but it does not work at all"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please provide a strikeoff feature. After strike it should show entry date and end date like between."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Feature request: maybe I'm missing something, but please make it possible to hide/archive individual groups in splitwise because the group filters aren't doing it for me. Other than that it's a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for roommates/flatmates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is the fantastic app I have ever come across .Very helpful and easy to use.thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is a lifesaver and a argument avoider when traveling with friends! The freemium model is great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app, I couldn't live without it anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to simplify calculations on trips with friends, know who paid what and be sure no expense is lost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"One of the entry was not synced due to the pic attached to it. It lead to some confusion where entries are there, but the split was wrong."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Confusing to add records. The word owed is confusing and also the circle indicators which indicate split is also confusing. Use simple words like who ""paid"" whom."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Works ok. Lots of features I don't need and the one feature that would be useful (default split ratios in a group) is behind a monthly fee."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for day to day use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"You could make settlement more intelligent. For example, in a group of 3, if A spent 200, B spent 100, and C spent nothing, the settlement would be making C give 100 to A. Your app makes C give 33 to B, and 67 to A and B 33 to A. Think it over."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A saviour during shared trips. Very useful app to have a track of group expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just using the free app to track/split expenses with one other person. Does everything I need it to easily, and no glitches."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not opening"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A must-have on group trips! What a lifesaver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So good!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not working properly since a month"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I just love this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super convenient."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"God send"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Well designed app. This has complete control on individual and group accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group expenses in trips and daily expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesomely handy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Aap need to be updated. viewing a particular activity details is easy, but when pressed back button to come again to the list of activities, it takes user to the top of list, i.e. the last activity in the section. User has to scroll again to come to that activity. If I need to check a lot of activity details then each time I need to scroll to go to particular activity in the list."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing 1st experience!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Maths hag diyaa hai bhai aapne😂😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly convenient ! Using it for last 2 years 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for calculating and splitting bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever, i'vd suggest you people to use another app. Everytime i add an expense it shows an error and then out of nowhere i see random people from my contacts owning me money. I can't delete the group, even if everything is settled up, i can't remove people, i for no reason owe people money and lastly i can't delete my account... What is wrong with this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Clean, easy to read and interpret. The receipt scan works well too in most cases (it needs improvement; the scan can't detect discounts on items). Also, excellent customer service :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for splitting expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Mehhh"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"very good if payment can be included that it becomes precise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for tracking and splitting group expenses. Also integrates seamlessly with PayPal or Venmo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"i have been using this app for almost 4 years now i have a good experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please do the integration of UPI payment in the application so that we can directly pay the dues or loans to friends from the splitwise application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful and really easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely easy and fast to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love using this app, makes keeping track of my partner and I's expenses easy! We used to use Google sheets but this is a million times better, it provides push notifications, does the math for you, it's super intuitive, and the best part is the automation categorization and archive of expenses! Never again do I need to ask ""did we adjust for this?"" Because I can check in seconds"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever seen. It supposed to make things simple but it's making things complex."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would be great if you could add off links etc even a Monzo me link on your profile etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Every friend of mine use it or atleast knowabout it. best app ever especially the split feature are well thought through."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. About the only thing which could make it better is a date of transaction for currency variances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Should be a way of adding account details and payment types so friends know how to settle with you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"No multiple photo upload. Bring it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App is good to split money but difficult when people like Pratik Mohanty don't pay back. Need automatic payment feature asap!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I came to Paris with high hopes, thinking I could change the world. But I met Pratik Mohanty and I was pushed into poverty. I am homeless and need money to eat food everyday. Please request him to pay me as he is evading Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Pratik mohanty not clearing balance, please add automatic money transfer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage/split bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Caculations are not correct please double check before you pay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very user friendly... Keeps good track of money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"So confusing and the interface is just over complicated"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It's a very basic app with extra features. It's hard to personalize and make it seamless to enter data."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"There is no icon for BOWLING 🎳. I had to use football icon for bowling bill and now friends are bullying me 🥺 Other than that the app is awesome 🔥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simplistic"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for about a month now. Easy to use and does exactly what it says."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good and user-friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, doing soo much order with payments along friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"When we settle up, the amount shown is different from what exactly you owe the person, because of this my friends had a conflict and they are not taking to each other anymore. Nice feature 👍🏼🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like it, helps me a lot with my team work trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is very nice but tell me how to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect app! Very useful, especially when traveling with friends......."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant. Made our vacation expenses super easy to figure out. Love the app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing for big trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Systematic and time saving calculator"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect one for manage group expenses 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Literally the best app for traveling in larger groups of friends. My friends and I have been using it for more than 2 years and we couldn't imagine traveling without it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super and use full app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Lovely application. It has made managing expenses on a shared trip so much easier for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very cool app, simplifies transactions in a great way."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its a great app. But defeats the purpose for people who dont feel comfortable asking for their money back, so there should be an option to ping people to settle. Otherwise its just numbers for them. 😂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loved It!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have things made easier for me and my friends. We're a huge group of friends who are paying for each other lunch etc. The app keeps track. Also very useful for trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using it for years now and it's very confident is splitting bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and clean"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Anything to merge duplicates? I don't know but same person got added twice. How to merge them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A 5 star experience Help me when we go to a group trip Expenses split like pro."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app with friendly options"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Favorite"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super-helpful app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use with lots of useful options. Perfect for group vacations. Strongly recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App does not show up in recent page when hitting the recent activity button. Why?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I wasn't going to leave a review, but they e-mailed me asking to. Turns out a calculator is faster than this app for splitting bills so I uninstalled it. They get a bad review for not letting me forget about how useless it was."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Annoying experience. Just wanted to split a trip without having to create an account and to invite other users to the app - just wanted to split expenses without having to involve other people in the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I'm using splitwise since last year bt bt I don't know since last 2-3 days i am trying to make a group and after adding friend as i am trying to add exp its been add bt just within couple of second as i am coming back to app no data is been found in the aap i had tried 10-12 times bt facing same prblm even i hve updated the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very love this app ♥️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very smooth usage experience. Saves a lot of time ans hassle"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"You should also give an option to split an expense %agewise. For example 2 out of 3 people can split 60% of an amount equally and remaining 40% can be paid by the 3rd person."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good Accounting System"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The bunnies did it for me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Can not get it to load on my older android phone"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Premium version graphs are not good. They need to be clear"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful app. We can manage our expenses and transactions also we can split our expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Recently i am facing some issues using the app As i add some expenses it doesn't show others how much they owe me or i owe them Any fixes for this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Should have a pie chart or dashboard to show the overall expenses in a diagram and which will allow us to understand the percentage spending and contribution."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Download this after a friend insisted to do so. This is super helpful and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bakwash unistall maro sub"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Aag hai aag🔥🔥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Bhaiii mst app bnaya tune"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app is good. It will be even good if you allow people to add bank details (or upi id) for easy payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best for people for having Trip together 👌🔥🔥"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Heel handig ik kan niet zonder"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I really thankful for helping to solve the problem, these people are doing best service to there customers. Wonderful, easy to use app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does the job and does it well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for roomates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I would say it's good application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App. I was using in India earlier. Now I'm using it even in England. Fantastic 😅"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Requires you to share contact info of all involved."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful App for a group but one thing I can say, Advance amount collected from individuals, option may also be included"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful and worth using app👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The totalling is always wrong"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unable to open the app. Getting Splitwise Runtime Exception. Please help"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise keeps crashing on Vivo X70 pro, funtouch OS, Android 11.. when can I expect a bug fix??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years now. It does exactly what it's supposed to through an easy to use, fully featured interface. Unlike most of the apps released today, it doesn't even have any bugs! I mean it actually works. Very cool. They also don't force ads on you or anything. I might upgrade just because these are all good things!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect travel accounting app. Anyone pays, settle-up afterwards... All participants connects - full transparency and log of all changes! Only one thing missing is calculator in adjustments section - that would really help when reading out long bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best app..really liked it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exactly what i needed"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app and works without issues but I have some minor complaints. I wish that when I get a notification of a bill that I owe, that notification would take me to a page that would have a pay button, instead it's just a page about the bill and I have to back out to the home page and go to the settle up page, I just feel that is unnecessary. I also would like it if calculator functions were available when entering an expense instead of just a num pad so I don't have to go back and forth."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Add credit/refunds to balances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Baummm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"No option to add advance payments among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Does exactly what I need it to! For years I depended on updating spreadsheets for settling expenses with friends and family. My spreadsheet was a work of art but it was still manual and depended on people reporting expenses to me accurately. This app has made it redundant and I love it for that. The users now have to make sure they enter what they pay for and the rest of the settling is done. Initially I found the interface not as easy, so 4 instead of 5 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing app. Member addition, group creation has fundamental flaws. Try other apps instead"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app is easy to use and very helpful for splitting expenses among people. The only issue I have is with the payment app in India, which is only a single one (Paytm). Please add more options like Google Pay, PhonePe, etc. Thank you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for college students..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for group finance management. Recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application. Kudos to developers and the idea.Great job guys"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Edit: Thanks for adding this! Great app for tracking group expenses. There's just one issue that's preventing me from giving a 5 star rating: the date of an expense recorded is not displayed in the list view. There's no way of seeing the date of an expense without going to the details view. It's just a minor UI change, but will make the tracking more helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is buggy. We were four and the app had bugs for each one of us- One was owed a different sum than actual, the other owed someone else other than the person she was actually in debt to. We ended up using a calculator for a weekend trip expense calculation. Don't count on it ;)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have loved this app whenever I've used is. Very sophisticated. Easy to use. Has a lot of features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Buggy Not splitting correctly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a great app to use, but there is a glitch or bug, once we add any transaction then add transaction button vanishes and app crashes, so we have to close it and open it again. Splitwise team look into it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If you're frequently involved in paid group events, such as a game or a dinner, then this app is a must have for you. It's very sophisticated & you're unlikely to find a use case that's not supported for tracking payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is very clear and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an amazing app. It saved me from a horrible messed up excel sheet a friend of mine has made. The sheet had decimal values for God sake!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent! This app helped me avoid an excel sheet created by a friend. Never going to look back at Excel sheets. Thank you Splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"To whom I didn't expense money in group it showing the I owe money from him. Very bad calculation by Splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy app to split the bills within friends."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice i like supporting developers with apps especiallyif i like the app, but would expect more from pro version, if I create a group and I'm pro, everyone should be able to add a receipt. Not just me. Saving the split, I would like to do it based on share..for different size families. Everytime I go in to split by share I need to fill in whole thing again. The saving share split should be defaulted and editable as a share split. A little disappointed based on the price you pay for pro."

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Hi Team, Love the app, but a quick feature request. Could you please add an indicator on the expense list to the expense item to convey that the expense has been settled. Like a simple 'settled' status label would also do. The only way to figure out now is to open the expense and check the comments. Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps ever created. I am love with it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app for expenses sharing... Makes everything very hassle-free and you can focus on enjoying your trips or buying what you want without having to worry about how you are going to settle the complicated expenses later.. Highly recommended!!"

I must admit that splitwise has become one of my active checklist option whenever I travel. It's absolutely easy to share and track expenses made by bunch of people. Thank you ☺️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"You can add expenses of course but editing changing deleting etc is not clear. If you hit the Q button it wants you to pay for the pro version. Other than just listing expenses it is difficult and cumbersome to use and is limited without paying for pro. Not satisfied."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Just good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Lacks a installment function where you can set recurrence for a limited amount of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I need an app that doesn't force me to message my contacts. Wish that feature was removed since having it makes this app useless for me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I need from a group-expense app! Gone are the days of fumbling with Excel spreadsheet to record and calculate expenses! The 'simplify' option is pretty neat! Wish there were more ways to pay online than just GPay though."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app.and easy to use.very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really cool. Works reliably and well. If I may request a feature which I was unable to find yet: It would be great if one could cap one person's contribution to a maximum total amount. The overhang could then be split among the remaining people."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever, don't know what my roommate life will be without it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It works fine, but if you are looking for a bill tracking app for roommates I'd pass on this one. Ideally there would be a way to record payment for specific expenses that you don't wish to settle up as part of a whole debt, and a way of listing bills that have to be split but still paid individually to a third and unconnected party (like rent to a real estate agent), but this app doesn't have those features. Unfortunate because it's a simple and clean interface that's really easy to navigate!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tried using this new version with some friends afer a trip and we all got different exchanges by default (some AUD, some EURO some USD) When we tried to set them up as the same currency, it asked us to upgrade to the paid version. Free version is garbage, ended up making it more complicated to split costs"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Demands access to your contacts and doesn't let you split bills anonymously. You can't even create fake contacts to add to the group because it demands valid email addresses. Forced viral marketing. I don't want a social app that contacts people on my behalf... I want to split a hotel stay. Uninstalling immediately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It is a great experience using splitwise, one suggestion from my side instead of of manual entry of all transactions if the app can read the transaction msgs from bank and automatically give a pop up to categorise the spend ( dept, loan, split betwwen frnds) ,will be much more impresive"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is incorrectly splitting what's owed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This does not work if your friend does not have an account in splitwise. Not everyone wants to install and create an account in splitwise.

Now states that one has paid an amount as a separate feature in the group whilst before when it said ""Liz borrowed from Tom for A, B and C"". Once you paid back that person for a specific activity it would state ""Liz paid Tom for A and B"". Now just says you borrowed for A, B and C and then doesn't settle up that individual event but states on top you paid that person a certain figure."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This worked great until I no longer had an expense, and found no way to simply delete it so it didn't recur any more."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy and useful! Perfect for roommates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app makes travelling and splitting the costs within your group so much easier and less stressful! No need to sort out who owes who since the app does it all for you! Each person enters their amounts on the go, then settle up at the end!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Bad user experience for group uneven splitting and lots of annoying bugs - the messaging keeps going back to the top and auto-scrolling through, the bill does some weird recalculations when two people edit the same bill at once, you can't save a draft of the total if it doesn't match up, you can't save/lock receipts and stop people editing, also very generic notifications when anyone changes anything... I can see this working for some people but an Excel sheet was much easier for us."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"exceptional"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saves A LOT of hustle. we've made it to 10 day 15 people trips and everybody was happy when we left! Feature request: Lat group members add their payment info to their profile, you might owe someone and not have their contact!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For kuwait expenses. Like 1.365 but your app allow only two digits. Like 1.37 Its not good for kuwait expenses. Because kuwait calculate 1 kwd=1000 fils. So when expenses bill come 1.365 and your app response 1.370 its afect 5 fils per expenses. Its big afect to total expenses. Please add 0.000 instead of 0.00"

It even allows you to connect to other payment apps like Venmo or PayPal so you can send money through those. If you pay with cash, that can also be recorded in the app :)"

I wish some of the features were not locked behind paywall but hey its free. I wish I could search an item (eg pizza) in a group and splitwise app would search all the times I have added pizza in the group through out years and total money I have spent on em. That would be interesting. (If that feature is already in the app then I haven't seen it probably because is pro only version)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Bunnies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If there were an ability to give it 10 stars, I would. This is an absolute game changer. My wife and I went on vacation with two other couples and never had to worry about how to split anything. One bill at every restaurant...every Uber trip logged. Absolutely perfect."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Really helpful. Made money management really simplified during our trip. Especially with such a big number of people. This app requires more recognition. It would be helpful if the option to add debits were available, and not just expenses."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is best, it literally deserves 5 🌟 We went to a tour and only 2 of us had cash which actually used, rest had Google Pay as option.

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application. It is so simple to manage your expenses. Very good app design - simple, clear, and intuitive at the same time. I made many friends join & use it. Just a feature I wish, that the group totals had the option to customize further, select a particular month maybe. Currently it has three options - this month, last month, all time. Just a customized option to get a quick view of recent months expenses. Maybe that is part of splitwise pro, but I hve not used that so cannot say"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great UI, ads are non intrusive for once!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What a godsent 🙏🙏 thank you so much! Also I set my app to emoji language lol fun troll guys 😆 Update: I paid for the premium because of the itemized receipt function, but I have been disappointed! When the scanned item/price is wrong, I cannot edit it but the only choice is to delete the item and re-add manually with the right detail. I'd like to see this option available. Update 2: I reached out to the developers team and they were very understanding! Best of luck🤞"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever for maintaining expenses among a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I can't see the option in settings to turn off the simplify debts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. Just one small request. You should have an option to maintain transactions between people...like one single heading for a series of expenses. I know groups can probably achieve that right now, but 2 people groups seem awkward. Also, groups stay, I want transactions to get archived as soon as they're settled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It helps when I vacation with others. Keeps it real, no arguments about what everyone owes. I love it."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life saver! 😇"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Data lost. I just changed the number of the other person and all the expEnse data was lost."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app has made our life so easy!! Thank you for creating this app 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and keep track of expenses with a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Including the entire payment ledger on the group page confused me and I ended up paying a lot of people I didn't need to - surely the front page should show only a high level view of payments and not each individual payment/settle? Not particularly intuitive for an app which is supposed to simplify the payment process."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is very useful for living in a sharehouse and the subscription to scan receipts is really worth it. It doesn't like double line items like fruits and vegetables (those can be put in manually and people can check the attached receipt still if uncertain potatos did cost that much) it's still useful as during lockdown in melb I would be shopping for multiple people getting different items and this is the easiest way of keeping track of who got what when for how much."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app but if you split with people who use the app in a different languages, the app will mix the languages in a very weird way. If my phone is set to English and my friend's to German, the app will mix the languages in the menus and buttons"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely loved this app. Very useful. :) Very user friendly. Great GUI Great features Really appreciate this app. Great work guys :)"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just a very convenient app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The UI experience is really great. Kudos to the one who got the idea of creating this. Simple and basic yet important."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple und einfach zu bedienen."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good to share the bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"topster"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"On new ver all expenses are shows the settled up . Please fix Bug asap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app! Downloaded it for a bachelorette party weekend where there were multiple meals to split and the app worked great! It did all the math for us so if, say, friend A bought 2 meals and friend B bought 1, it'll calculate how much B still owes A and you only have to pay each person once total at the end of the weekend. I also like the remind feature, it's a nice nudge but it's nice to have the app do it rather than having to contact that person again separately."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I think i can't mean it more for any other app when i say that Splitwise has made my life much easier account-wise. 😊 hugs of appreciation to the creator🙌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A neat simple tool for keeping track of who owes what, great for traveling with friends. Importantly, this app has been around for at least 8 years (that's how long I've been using it) and didn't go bad the way web services usually do these days: no ads, no obnoxious upselling attempts, no redesigns ruining the UI, no frequent updates, not getting slower or buggier over time, no other obvious bloat. So hopefully it'll stay usable for a while longer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app to maintain the expense and all team member can identify easily."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"How about marking a expense as lost cause. If I know that is not returning so I can move on. Track somewhere else not in main page"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App is bit confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Yeah, this app is dope as hell. No more asking a server to split up a bill and you can just Venmo once at the end of the trip"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective, does exactly what it says. Allowed calculating expenses between 10 people for me"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended for shared bills and trip accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really usefull and easy to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There is no way to add people to an expense without inviting them to the app. I was hoping to just use this as a calculator but it's unusable unless everyone you want to split with is using the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great way to split costs amongst friends during a trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We used this app to plan our expenses on a trip and it was very efficiency and user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"My boyfriend and i use this all the time to keep track of what we owe each other for food and rent etc. Made everything a lot simpler. Great app."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Cannot be trusted. Sometimes splits the expenses right, sometimes it doesn't."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life changing, literally, makes weekends away and nights out with friends so so so much easier!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I don't like that you have to include contact information like an email in order to add other individuals. Otherwise the app works well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Would be great if payment apps could be interfaced"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Might I suggest you can add an option to upload receipts/invoices also."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Coming from an old BillMonk user. Overall good app to track expenses and IOUs. However, some basic things like manually shifting debts are hard to do... (like concentrating debts from onto one person for convenience , and creating a separate debt with that total amount, like when A, B, C owe you, but you meet D often, but A, B, C are geographically closer to D so you manually shuffle debts such that A, B, C owe D and D owes you that total amount...)"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good app 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's s great functional app.. but what's with the new UI/UX.. its made more difficult to use than earlier. Simlify it.. showing date wise expenditure on dash board make little sense to this app.. please go back to person wise list.. this app is for splitting between people it's not an everyday expenditure recorder. And Make it minimal too please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"In Group spending summary, we have only limited details when compared with iphone ... why can't we have these details (like total paid, total spend, balance share, total share etc...) in Android.. as such in iphone..."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really makes it easy to communicate who pays what and what's still outstanding to pay. Will use this again!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for splitting bills among friends, roomies or flat mates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app..😇"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really useful app however I think the group split function needs to be a bit smarter ie. If an expense doesn't include all members of the group it shouldn't be visible to the members not included in the expense. Also, it would be useful to log expenses in different currencies as the app doesn't balance the totals when different currencies are used. Other than that been really useful to track expenses between friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It is really confusing in the app. Though it is settled still it is showing the amount as green. Need to find another one to manage expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life saver"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total group spending completely wrong it has to based on the group i create, but it wrongly calculates."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why this app doesn't have support for regional languages."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"One of the least intuitive apps I've used. 1. One cant settle up on one thing or a few things on the list, namely to check as paid only things he choose to pay for. 2. The way to the settle up button after getting a notification on payment you owe is just too long. 3. Conection of the app to credit card would be much easier for the users, instead of going out of the app, open other app for payment and synchronize between the two."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful, good UX"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please add dark theme. You just have to create themes.xml in night folder. Update: thanks for adding dark theme"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and Convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really needs to handle returns/reimbursements properly. Not available in the app at all, website ONLY (makes no sense). Even when you put in the return/reimbursement, it says something like ""you owe $20 and have paid $10"", the calculations are correct but the statement is unnecessarily confusing. A basic feature so dreadfully implemented leaves a lot to be desired. Sorry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"ما باهمکارامون هولینگ دکتر کرمانی به صورت دونگی هر روز خرید می‌کنیم و بستنی و کیک و ناهار میخریم و این برنامه به ما کمک میکنه که بتوانیم حساب و کتاب هامون رو انجام بدیم"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The math is wrong. The balances are all messed up. The UI is very easy to use and well designed but the app fails to serve its primary purpose."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise calculating issue: I use Splitwise with my partner. I just recalculated after using Splitwise for around 5 months. & i found out that the amount was 36 cent higher on Splitwise than it was supposed to be. Reason: when splitting uneven amounts it rounds and in total it's wrong by 0.5 cents(0.95 cents will be splitted 48 cents for everyone, in total 96 cents)This may not be a lot if it happens one time but using it over years could mean that it is wrong by maybe 10 euros. Please fix :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Request: Please ADD DARK MODE!! Other feedback: 1. Adding a friend is not easy. Please do something about it. 2. Group management also needs to be worked on. 3. Add Square Cash Payment option. Other than that its a fantastic app! Kudos!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy, a lot less awkward to settle up with friends & family. No one has to say ""hey, you owe me $$ for dinner"", etc. Just enter all receipts and split...equally or with specific people!! We used it on a girls trip and it was amazing! We even settled up before we left the airport with cash, Venmo or PayPal. Highly recommend this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"There is a bug - I add myself to group after some expense was created and it says that I am not involved and indeed there is no my name in participants list. How do I add myself to expense? There is no such button. Also, when I click edit - the member list says ""you and ..."" Saving expense again doesn't fix the issue."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is just so useful! Saves a lot of time in math and payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app till date, extremely useful. Easy to maintain records for to whom I owe. Few feature update will make it perfect. 1.allow to add expense in past date, it will help users to keep exact track with more details. 2.have some basic video training for users as they get confused sometimes, when they repay me the money, they should settle up rather then adding it as expense from their end."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very poor, no updates for a very long time. Should show categories and should allow to sort the list atleast"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall a great app that helps you solve spliting bills. Great for trips and relationships. The free features are great and enough for most people. One feature it painfully needs: Being abel to add people to an expense, who have not been in the group when the expense was created. Then will the app deserve 5 stars..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Really useful app for handling group purchases or even everyday expenses. The only issue I'm having is the fact that refunds are not supported. If I return an item and receive a refund, the only way to report it is to either scroll down to find the item and update the value, or insert a weird value (only from the web app), which gets counted as money owed, and so as an expense, messing up with the total monthly amount spent."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Makes tracking and sharing of expenses easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I use Splitwise everytime I do trips with friends. Highly recommend!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app for tracking expence"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A real savwe if you live in a shared accomondation!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Remarkable app...just two notes: 1- add the chance to change the date on the ""add new expense"" view. Why? many families just load a bunch of expenses per week and it is boring to have to jump into expense detail views to change it. 2- set a default split for a group, but also for type of expense on the premium app. Why? We spend for 50% of the rent and all the bills, but groceries deoends on #of kids :D 3- Add the last used split to the default splits list. 99% of cases will be covered."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I usually go on alot of trips with friends. This application has completely solved the 'MONEY Split and Settlement' problem between friends. Highly recommended application as it directly tell you how much you owe or how much people owe to you in total with proper calculations and breakdowns. I don't usually do the efforts of writing reviews, but this definately needed a 5 star review."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for transactions history."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for trip financial planning Especially when you are going with your friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Un app veramente notevole ed efficace: comodissimo aggiungere dallo smartphone le spese e ancor più bello poter rivedere tutto su PC . Anche se uno solo del gruppo usa splitwise è comunque uno strumento valido per gestire le spese di gruppo con possibilitá di escludere persone da voci specifiche o indicare che l acquisto è stato effettuato da un altro/altri. Edit: continuo ad utilizzarla, sempre perfetta!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Me encanta la aplicación, es alucinante, distribuye y ajusta cuentas a la perfección. Se la recomiendo a todo el mundo."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Went on a girls trip to Mexico! This was so easy perfect way to keep track of expenses!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Works almost well. But when a friend leaves the group everything breaks down. We cannot edit payment including a member who left. But we can still delete it. And when we delete it, it is not synchronized and all phones don't see the same thing anymore. I also find that there is too many useless features and confusing design. Overall I would recommend the tricount app instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient. Love it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice job"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mast h re baba"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't show the total amount I spent from all the groups"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Greatest apps ever. I don't have any comments on the apps. It just a great apps. I think they have their own server because if I record the expenses, my friend also will get the notification no matter where they are. However the pro version price is quite expensive for me because u need to pay every month. If the price is only one-off payment, maybe I will consider to purchase it to support."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic and very useful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app shows wrong calculations."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Yes it's ia great app for room mate , you don't need to beraca diary or hisab kitab for that ...awsmmm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you explicitly set Venmo username on your account. Which creates a terrible payment user experience. Venmo money sent to non existing account. And then having to reverse it. I don't understand why it's not possible to set your Venmo username. This garbage user experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No option to add advance payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great app but you have to have the person's phone #, super inconvenient"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's very cool features and it's very helpful for who shared room or rent room outside from home."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It makes life super easy when you want to track group expenditure. The customisation available to split the cost is extremely helpful. Also for a solo traveller it helps keeping track of your own expenses. Overall, it is a fabulous product which comes in very handy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I got automatically logged out and couldn't log back in. Idk if it's down. I'll update if problem gets solved"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great for single owes. Nearly impossible to understand when used with groups. No way to decern how the totals are arrived at without diving in yourself and even then youre left with math that does not add up sometimes. Very confusing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The format is just not conducive ends up making things messier, would anytimw prefer taking manual notes over using this app."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for settling up the accounts on trips, contri parties,etc. Very fascinated by the algo used by this 🔥"

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I don't like the new UI. I personally preferred the old one. It was simpler, much more useful I believe."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to split your bills✌️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app you want to speak your expenses between your friends and you want to join here and there and you don't want to pay all. This is a perfect for this purpose. However I do wish you offer a pitch Black theme for AMOLED displays."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Shite"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app for its utility and simplicity. New updated interface is poor. 3 stars downgraded only because of poor interface update. Otherwise 5 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have for keeping tab of expenses while travelling in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Update is not good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have used this app for more than an year and it has been really helpful. Splitwise helped us through all the way when we 4 of Bachelors were staying in an apartment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it to split expenses with large groups or individual friends. It's super easy to use and makes breaking everything down a breeze. This stuff can get really complicated really quickly without good management, and that can lead to harsh feelings among friends splitting expenses, so relying on this app to do all the work means more good times and fewer headaches."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app ever!! i use it everyday, before this app i spent a lot of dayly hours writing down spends, support services, recurrent services for a list of clients, now i can trust that everything will be on this app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In Group Expenses there should be an option of viewing every group members expenses seperately. In the current application I can see total group expenses and only my expense. There should be a provision of viewing contribution of each group members by a single click."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is just mind-blowing for managing expenses. The options while entering a shared expense are just perfect. The recent UI overhaul was very welcome and much needed. More than expectation was delivered there. Cheers to the developers! The only thing the UI falls short of is a dark mode. I think the app will be truly complete when that's added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhaii sahab....jab se ye app install kiya hai..18000 ke karze mein aa gaya...bhuka nanga ghoom raha prr karza nhii utar rahaa...kidney bech ke (dost ki) karzaa utarne chala tha...prr kidney bhi ek hi nikli..😢😢"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Actually one of the best app on app store. LOTS OF LOVE AND RESPECT TO TEAM! WELL DONE GUYS💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"👎👎👎👎"

This app has solved our all problems because we can manage all expenses without any hassle and information to mates reaches in real time. Thumbs up for the team who developed this with ultimate new idea."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible! Some months ago if you'd have asked me, I would have said it's a great app. But now it constantly glitches for our group and shows wrong calculations or settled up even when the other person owes something. And don't bother asking me to email you, because I already emailed support a month ago and you guys didn't bother responding. Moving on to better apps!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Crashes each time I add an expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice app but sometimes misbehaves. It doesn't show the line items but shows the total amount Can you do something for the same"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the new look!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No need to worry about calculating how much money you owe or others owe you. This app has got your back. Install it. Trust me you won't regret it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I purchased Splitwise Pro and the money got deducted but it's showing membership cancelled. And neither the money is refunded."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app, love it and use it a lot among friends specially when traveling."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for bacholors especially for room mates"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Bunnies 🐇"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Top class app to manage ur monthly expenses .Especially also when u want to split & spend when moving about in groups ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"In the 'Activity' section if I check a month old expense and go back it goes to the top of the page. Its really annoying having to scroll again and again toh check older Activities. Please change this. Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome from its inception, better with every year."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"When some amount is not paid equally by everyone but only by some members of a group, three so still shows equally in the confirmation. The screen where you add expense and tick the check mark. The screen should which members are involved in the transaction. Please fix it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I've been using this for years. With the new UI, we are defaulted to group screen when opening. When we settle individually to friends, the group shows the same remaining balance..And add a GPay gateway or any UPI to send amount from app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best cost sharing app of all time!!! I don't mind paying for the app but if you had a one time purchase option, I'd be more inclined to pay it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Where to check for settled up transactions?"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Game changer when going on group holidays together!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is what was missing us. As an undergarduate student, I think this is the best app to use in order to organize our finances. The app will be better if it supports Arabic and other global languages."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Me and my wife never fight over who owes anymore. Relationship saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I agree with all the other reviewers. The previous design was far more usable and practical. Why did you ruin one of my favorite apps?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing. Once a payment is made there is no way to look back was it the amount really owed?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Exported CSV file doesn't have much information"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent work by Dev✌️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Navigation should be a little bit more easy. It doesn't show monthly total expenses of each individual."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Introduce dark mode also"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for tracking expenses on all trips since past 3-4 years now. Easy to use and keeps track of expense perfectly."

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have one suggestion while creating group instead of adding group member provide an option to select number of person in group and later for each number we will add group member or just keep number as it is.... How it will be more useful is let's 2 family (husband,wife and husband,wife) went for trip on that time just create group with 4 member and only 2 person(husband) will use Splitwise because can't force all to use and it's needed tooo..... It's just my suggestion......"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app Just I have one suggestion as business analyst for developer, it'll be great if u add ability for user to hide group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's simply amazing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything ab this app is really nice except the fact that once u enter something it can never be completely erased/deleted!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really good application for personal uses And better then other app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Main drawback of this app is it won't give contacts automatically like ok credit etc.. apps. This is main main main drawback of this app. That's why I am thinking to uninstall."

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Do we get any update in which we can tranfer money on the app ?"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best possible app for splitting bills"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, simple, balances very nicely"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app when dealing with multiple expenses and people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Add a feature to multiple select expenses and transfer them in bulk between groups"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing App !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The new update has made things worse. The expense has not been split up equally like it used to. And in the friends tab, a person who's owing a lot of money is being shown as 'settled up'. Please fix the issue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great tool!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No option to download attached image. Previous version has better UI."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I never rate anything but this app has actually changed my life."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy and handy! ❤"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It has jumbled up all the expenses. I am noting one thing very clearly and it is saving something else altogether."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Now that I am more accustomed to the new UI, the app feels great again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a good nd usefull app for splitting"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for sorting out pocket money with the kids"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Highly user friendly. Very useful in keeping accounts between friends and others"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I hate absolutely HATE PayPal!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,",7 I ,"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life saver"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The simplify debts seems to be not working in the latest version!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Go back to the cleaner UI please. The new UI is unnecessary complicated and unintuitive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The free version worked well but when I wanted a more detailed version for tax purposes it did little to make life easy. Not worth it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for the friend who often go out and split the cost between them"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I just wish there was a Zelle integration (like the one with Venmo)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall very good app, but about going Pro, here is my feedback: Default Split is the reason I tried Pro but finally cancelled. Basically I was ready to pay for comfort/ease of use, but the fact that this setting is Personal and not group wide doesn't make me gain any comfort/ease of use in the end. I still have to go edit spendings created by my wife. So I don't see the point of paying Pro for this feature if I have still have 50% of the job to do manually."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app. But but complicated to use for new user"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love Splitwise, Its convenient, user friendly and way too awsome! Simplifies a lit of things!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app does NOT simplify sharing expenses among roommates. In fact, it's a monthly headache to figure out the missed details in the totals it gives us. We just want ONE number that tells us what to pay each person. But it neglects certain costs, especially if you have a private expense with a person that's also in the group. We also have different totals for costs among us which causes tension. We're looking for a new app or we're reverting to pen and paper. Run away, don't walk!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Genius!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best of all, bro .we proud of this app developers 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for expenditure calculations, doesn't matter whether it's a trip or sharing apartment spends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"SUPERB"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exclusive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"D#xTdf xx we AA and write a and the day of experience with sse you will r we w you w I we as well we"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The new update makes it so annoying to use. I only use this now to share expenses with one person in one currency, always only had to click on their name and add a new one. Now it always makes pick between old groups and contacts even when I click on that person's name, and always starts in US dollars even though we never use that."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The user experience is not good like the old one especially the colors. In the old version my eyes can see everything from the first look. However the new design I took much time to find what I need. My opinion is to highlight the important things like the old design"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely useful utility. Great app!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice for frnd group.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The new UI is good but I actually liked the old one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The redesigned version is confusing and hard to use. Many a times added expenses doesnt show up on the opening screen and we have to enter it again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have always used splitwise for managing finances with friends but, since the new UI has been deployed I is harder to add expenses. It would be awesome if the friends tab is default and not the groups. I also see that the expenses between the common people in group and friends is not calculated correctly. These are the reasons why I'm giving a 4 star. If these are resolved, I would rate it 5."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app bravo!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Now it explains more about who owes who. The default menu should be changed to friend's expenses again and not group. Interface has become much more cooler."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"To the team: what if y'all created a sister product that let families record expenses. Currently, there's no freemium model out there that allows instant backups. You could use the tech foundation of Splitwise. And bring on board the families of your current target audience, casting a wider net. Happy to help more."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad app design - using the number 0 in your passcode locks you out since the actual log in screen doesn't have the 0 key - instead there's a biometric scan button that also doesn't work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I really recommend it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"This used to be a lot more easy to understand but this latest update is confusing as hell. Simply figuring out how much you owe is way more complicated than it used to be and tracking the accounting between all the groups etc leaves me scratching my head. Love the look of the new design but not the interface."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente para jugar Poker!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"We can improve a lot in splitwise .... Just compare other apps which can read all expenditure from message and provide graph and remainders etc ... This app is good but it has to improve a lot."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Hate the new UI"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Still decent but getting worse. Why does it make it more and more complicated to add expenses? Groups are default menu even though I don't have any active ones and don't need to see them. I need to scroll through a bunch of old ones of I want to add an expenses. The type of split drop-down is even less intuitive now compared to how it was before. And there's no customization settings at all. They need better UI/UX."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest updates have made things worse.I am unable to add any expenses and after I reinstalled it does not even go past the welcome screen.The developers have messed up the new update."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Old app layout was good. Now it's confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Setting up should be accepted by both parties. Add payment gateway, atleast a link to gpay and/or other upi apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's fantastic. Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I am not able delete/close the account .. getting mails even though I stopped using app from long time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"MVP not delivered, the premium feature they pushing for is to get charts on the fly, but when you dig deep to make the charts useful they don't have most of the features ready. Is it worth 28 pound?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does what it says it does. Split expenses seamlessly. Does all the work for you, even payouts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I wish if i can thank owners of this app personally!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"App is really good and relatively easy to use. It would be much better if the ""Itemized expense"" split option can be added to the Mobile App as this will help update and take the picture in once go. Basically, the same split options should be available on the both the website and Mobile App."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sometimes we need to charge interest, it would be great if options like interest applicable is given."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this for 3 years. Absolutely wonderful to track my spending."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Add dark mode then I'll mark it 5 stars. It's blindingly bright!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The latest update is irritating. Not at all user friendly and it hangs. Hope it improves soon.🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great help. But the last update has made the app ugly and cumbersome. Too big fonts and images. Seems like a magnifier is on all the times. They also chenged the language which got complexer. Earlier one was simpler and crisp. Plese roll back this UI version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Since more then 4 years I tell people that this is the best app ever created. It makes life so much easier. With family, friends, partners. I have used for many years now with my flatmates. Currently using with my partner. But always use for traveling. And also for organising parties. Maybe one day I will try the paid version. My weekly commitment from The Five minutes journal today was to leave a review on a product or business that has changed my life for better. Thank you, Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Refreshed. Nice!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hahaha sometimes the solution to your issue is right in front of your face and that's why you cannot see it... I suppose. The app is great, functionality is on point"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I've been using splitwise for many years now and I really like it but the new UI made it so unessecerally hard to add an non-group expense because I have to select which contact I'm adding, not just click on their name like before. Please revisit this decision."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app out there for keeping track of the amount spent. It can be used on a trip or as a daily expense group. It's simply the best. I had given it 3 starts earlier due to the repayment process which was too complicated. After the developer told me about ""Simplify Group Debts"" feature, I've got no issues/complaints."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So far good. 👍🏻"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was great until last update, I am not able to add expense and save it until I add .00 in the amount section. For example, if I add 150 dollars it won't accept it. I have to add 155.00 and save it. Horrible"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"for this latest design, can you sort the group by the latest expenses update. Or at least have the option to sort."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"app is very good, add feature for hiding settled contacts"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For version 5.0.1/511 Absolutely terrible, clunky and overcomplicated new UI. Too many tabs, too many unnecessary clicks for something the earlier version did with minimal effort. Why fix something that isn't broken? Please go back to UI like the earlier versions. Coz the current one is ruined in the pursuit of ""minimalistic simplicity."""
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terribly buggy and difficult to understand"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sooooo useful!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"A nice app to have."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is so cool and I am using this app from very long time. The latest update which they released in April 2021 is not that much good, the UI is looking really bad.☹️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Unable to upload profile pic and I am requesting some of features like uploading quick bill for spending amount, deleting group, good to have dark mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My God this app caused nothing but chaos... it's the first time im using it but everyone got frustrated.. I don't have venmo I can't pay ppl like that maybe add Google pay also, but damn people's transactions aren't showing up, I don't know if I got paid etc. Will prob never use again"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"For a couple of years, using this app. Very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Loved it! Especially if you are flatting with more than 2 flatmates. It works perfectly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Is easy to use & it helped me to sum/minus/settle out the amount for me & my friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app but the recent UI update needs some love,it is inconsistent in places and a lot more clunky to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excelente para organizar viajes con amigos"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It was great before the most recent big update. The groups were easier to manage and you didn't have to type who you were splitting with every time, just choose the group. It's less intuitive now. Also, the app crashes every time I add an expense!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Managing expenses are so easy now!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome app.. Good to analyse expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Disappointed with new version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Should allow more photos to be attached as receipts.. otherwise it's a very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Just coz I am hating the new UI. It almost looks like a Google doc. Earlier version was so beautiful and genuinely good UX (plus minus few things)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome experience with this application. No single bug always shows correct and 100 % accuracy results."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Unable to add non spitwise member"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Sync error with server"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for ppl who share accommodation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app for expense management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for more than 4 years now. Loved it. It would be great if we have Indian UPI payment integration."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love the design update! The new UX has so many of the improvements I needed, and some I didn't realize I needed. As a UX designer, it's so satisfying to see such great work. Thank you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New look is not good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I really loved this app but hate the new version.. When splitting the bill by share, by default EVERYONE in a group has one share. It's extremely inconvenient if there are some people not involved and the shares need to be changed from 1 to 0 for EVERY one of these people... Please change this back to the default of having 0 shares."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Dark Mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the greatest, useful app ever i seen in my life... It's really useful for our camp life..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please change it to previous version. This new version is not user friendly.Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful for splitting costs with flatmates, friends, travelling partners. I use it all the time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saves friendships"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was my favourite app until they change the UI and UX. I loved the complete interface untill the last month but now it's just super annoying colours and icons which are very difficult to use. Please revert the designs back."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"They force people to pay in venmo or paypal. I want an ability to opt out of both abd list my own methods of payment."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Saviour of roomates expenses , without this we could not have managed the expenses efficiently .thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfectly fine for what it's made for."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have used this while on holiday with a friend, worked really well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"But loved it's old version more"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is not working while using"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great app with nice and easy interface and no ads obstruction. And simplified debts are great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app from 2014, but never have I ever faced such a non-user-friendly interface. Really disappointed with something that has been so helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app every day in my expenses, really good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app I've been using for many years now. The recent design overhaul is refreshing and actually improved the UX. One of the few apps I pay for, even though I'm not using the premium features often. Kudos from a fellow app developer."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With the new update this app has become very user unfriendly and it keep crashing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The update is worst .... don't show one of my friend in a list, it never happen before but this update have this problem ...i think the previous update was good .we can directly see all the expenses while opening the app ...if this will not solve we will leave this platform ..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Overall good for daily usage..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's a good app for team or friends to use.. Very efficient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Made sharing and setting group expenses so easy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love it great for splitting costs and keeping track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to track expenses with a big group and/ or with someone you regularly meet. It meets all my requirements: quick and easy to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Pretty good app for shared expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app! I've had it for about 2 years and still happy I downloaded it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I like the new design, but it would really help if there was a dark mode."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this since 2015 & have been quite satisfied. Have got lots of my friends onboarded as well since this has made splitting money painless. However with the latest update, the UI changed quite a lot - most noticeable one to me is the change in how you select the dates as there is no way now to change year or month easily. Also the unequal splitting options are now hidden too deep for my liking. Maybe get these 2 back to what they were before? Also note the new UI feels a bit too rigid."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It had been the best app and my favorite one, before its interface changed a week ago. Please, turn it back! Round icons, green head, big gap between name of a group and its amount - were more convinient to use and had better design. Really, rectangular icons are ugly :( I also dislike that inside an expence box the calendar button and the group button have switched their places."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I loved this app until the latest update. This new design is just so inconvenient. Now I hate it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"After the update, it makes much more sense to create a group for your bills even if you're only two in it. Once you make that change the remains quick and intuitive."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app 👌👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The New UI seems horrible. Didn't like it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The latest update is just sucks I totally dunno how to use anymore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and Effective!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to use after installation. Keeps crashing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Idea is amazing. The new UI is not so associative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The perfect app with easy to maintain line items and very convenient to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please give milk column also With the fix price. In which we can input only milk quantity daily and automatically calculate for all days"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for friend and family, and to keep track of money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quite handy app to have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A lot of bugs. Was better long before"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"So helpful!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice update!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Now that I've been using it for 2 years I can't imagine life without it..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"They are not giving option to remove account. They are just keeping user sensitive information with them. I was having 2 accounts and I am trying to delete one but no option available. Even Facebook gives this option but splitwise not giving. Don't install it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"update #4: It shows the date now!! much better! Receipt cropping issue has been fixed. The support team was very responsive and professional."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It was working well before the update..now in split equal section out of 10 people only 9 persons are visible..the 1 person automatically adds to every transaction"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Prettu Intuitive UI, easy-to-use features, best app I have seen to track expenses between friends and family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The old UI was better though."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please undo the last update! As is terrible!!!! Has so many bugs!!! Used to be a good up but now sucks...sorry to tell u that.... Update: After update in app store all works like before. I am giving u back all stars! Good job guys! Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"*Fixed* thanks guys for the quick response. In the new interface tha last name in the list while adding group expenses is always hidden, and that name is selected in every expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good application 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"With new update, it's prompting for biometric for every single interaction inside the app. It's getting frustrating to use it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an amazing app, even better with the update. I am using the free tier, as it is enough for what I need and I am really grateful for it. It has become invaluable on the group trips. And extremely useful on the daily basis for shared expenses. Please add dark mode."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the new UI..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After updation.. all names are not visible while adding exances.. it showing only 7 persons.. please make the bug fix."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best ever app for the personal expenses monitoring without failing to pay the due and not letting the payee to forget my due.. Hats off to the team who has created this, so innovative and creative application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"the new UI update sucks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After getting the new update it is worse. Uploaded photos of bills are showing in croped form and i am not even able to zoom the photo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"For some reasons 80% of the money transferred be venmo through this app never made it to me. It made a big mess not just me but for almost everyone in the group. We ended up paying each other the normal way, much better and easier than this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"What did you guys do with the last updated! looks and feels absolutely awful!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice look and feel.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Good idea, poor UI execution. Overall it ends up being more work trying to navigate the app than it's worth to sort out payments among friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for expenses! Surely recommend it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update just complicated stuff. Worst update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"New UI is modern and this is a much needed refresh."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the new redesign!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent for group outings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have loved using this app for so long, but the latest version is so hard to use and no longer allows me to do the basic tasks I was doing before. Please please please revert!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can i please revert back to the old design? The material design looks good but i need more productivity and the previous design was more helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of the best apps for splitting bills between friends. Now with all the useful basic features such as itemized bills being locked behind an extremely expensive paywall, there's no point to using this anymore. Time to find an alternative."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Current review: The new UI is cluttered and not user friendly at all. The previous UI was excellent, very clean and way on the eyes. The current one has way too much happening on a small screen. Previous review: excellent application. does what it says. thanks to the developers for such an excellent app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not a big fan of the new UI, will take some time getting used to it. And Oh My God. This app needs a dark mode badly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great work on the redesign team"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app was great but the new ui change is a bit confusing and not reliable as the former. The pictorial,circular and graphical representation were great but the list of expenses when opening the app is not so welcoming. The color accent is not compatible with the new UI change."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The new material theme looks insanely good! Great work! The concept of splitwise pro is bad through ☹️. I would prefer a splash screen with an advertisement and full features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hate the new interface"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app has helped living with flatmates and my bf very easy, no more ""who payed for what? When? You sure?"" Splitwise is there to help out 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Four stars because I wish the Pro version was a one time payment, not a subscription."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Happy with the new UI. Looks great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Such a great way of keeping track of all payments made by everyone!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Dark mode? Please."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app. Out of my mind. Not easy to handle at all. It should be like even an illeterate can handle this app.😏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the UI in the latest update (April 2nd 2021). I haven't had a chance to explore much but it looks neat!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This app had been a huge help. I used to recommend it to a lot of people, however, after the present update it has become impossible to use. The app is facing so many glitches, besides, the interface has become exceedingly non user-friendly. I'm highly disappointed, hence the 3 stars."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New interface is horrible and doesn't work great. A button was hiding a person in a group so I couldn't see there name. Why change something that works so well??? Please change it back or give us the option to"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"EDIT: new redesign is terrible, makes the interface less user friendly. Everything visually blends together so it's hard to quickly see what you want. I can't imagine having to learn how to use the app for this first time with this design. OLD: Amazing app if you need to split living or trip expenses with other people. Super easy to use and has everything you could need."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very organized"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The new look is a bit overwhelming. However, I like that you see the date of the expense now without having to click on it. And my previous complaint about not being able to use a comma has already been fixed - thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We use it for family spends and it's so good. The customer service is awesome too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have 2 payments from 1 group of different currency. However only one outstanding payment is shown in the dashboard"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Previous version was way better you people ruined the app experience after the update 😒😒"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"New ui not looks good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps ever made!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"जरूरत से जादे नोटिफिकेशन आते हैं"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It would be great to be integrated with a rapid payment system, like Twint in Switzerland, Revolut, or other easy alternative. So the settle up button would automatically send the transfer!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The is the best app that I have used for splitting expenses with friends. Works as expected and never found any issues till date."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update does not provide a clear overview anymore. Usefulness has degraded a lot"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for recording purchases amongst people. Used it with a group of friends over a long vacation, made keeping track of everything financial a breeze. Now I use it in everyday life to keep track of my girlfriend and my split finances, ie who owes how much after bills are paid. Literally a life saver, even better when recording expenses for groups greater than 2. The new UI looks great as well. Everything seems modernized and streamlined. UX is fantastic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"An already great app made superb with the modern UI update! Looks super aesthetically pleasing to the point where I feel like I want to split more bills with friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"First time i installed but one person is already added and i have to pay him Rs:413 why i should i pay him"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Please restore back to older UI. That was much more user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Perfect, modern app, but too expensive the pro version"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What a perfect app, no ads no jhikjhik. Do your regular stuff. Really useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update is scrapped the app. Now getting server error while adding new expenses. Tells no permission."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great ux. Edit: new ux is poor"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Not liking the new UI... Understand that you are trying to make it look simpler, the text display is better but the visual representation of the owed by you and owed by friends are all gone and it all looks too plain."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A little confusing at first but made my trip SOOOOOO much easier with 12 girls for a Bachelorette trip!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thank you for updating it and showing the dates like iPhone. Easy now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Better with update, like to see the spend date"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Can I please have the old UI?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great work guys seams crash problem sorted thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Latest update removed the big green/red header fields that showed if I am owed or if I owe money. The new look is less clear and I preferred the old one. Plus, why no dark mode :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Using this app for tracking transactions between friends. Very user friendly and handy."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"After the recent update: Can't type the amount, that field not working ! Unusable No payment options other than paytm! that's not convenient, You should add UPI and other modes of payment"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for taking notes about tour spendings, mainly If tou haver a group of people which tou share bills and other expenses with. There are many options on how the expenses were paid and who owes who. The latest version has greatly improved the user interface with a more modern look, which fits well with current standards. Overall, super recommended, 10/10"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful.. I use it with my roommates and it was so useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps I have seen for splitting payments, easily with only a click of a button. Allows for many different methods of splitting equally/unequally. Easy to get new people on board and invited to your group. Only could do with an improvement to allow removing people (within the group) from a split payment. Also could allow do with a ""split the the rest equally "" button."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The old UI was better and showed a summary wrt people and not groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I really dislike the new interface - Splitwise has been a well loved and well used app of mine for years now. Having gotten used to the old interface for so long, it had the same sudden shock of transition from Windows 7 to 8, and it's made everything harder than it was before. Why fix something that's not broken?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb and amazing app. It really helpful our monthly calculations."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love the long awaited update - the app feels much fresher, and works perfectly, as always."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Great app but improvable. 1) Pls add dark mode. The app is too white! 2) While adding an expense from home screen long press context menu, there should be an option to 'Save and add another' or similar button along side 'Save' so that the user can quickly add another expense to the same group without having to change tab from home and going through the list."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I liked the previous UI much better. It would be great if you can make can option to switch UIs"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and easy to use add for keeping and update record of daily expenditures"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have always loved this app! It had made my life so so so much easier. I don't know what I would do without to. I've even recommended it to friends and family. If only I could get some bonus for it 😂 Also, I love the new update! It is so beautiful!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app is getting crashed every second i open it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good aap. Really helped me a lot in tracking expenses and splitting them with friends and family. I rely on splitwise for managing my finances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise has worked fine, but with the new redesign of the UI, the prompt to 'simplify payments' is so huge and intrusive. I dont want to simplify the payments, its too hard to double check and track where the money goes when its turned on."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Other than Google apps, this is One of the 3 apps I use often that excede my expectations! Great flexibility in splitting costs with my roommate, both recurring and one offs. Thank you so much for your work on this app! Love the April 2021 update!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update sucks and not a user friendly. I have been using this for 5-6 years now but now it's interface is not user friendly and helpful. Didn't like the update this time. They should not try anything they had their own USP but now that is gone."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It seems like it doesn't do much, but the one thing it does, it does well. I have used it with my boyfriend-fiance-husband through the last few years to keep track of shared expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Newest update is pretty, but has made it *significantly* slower to upload bills that are to be split unequally (more scrolling & additional steps). Very disappointing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"UI became too bad..after latest update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for group expenses. We use it for years in big groups, totally reliable, does everything I could think of."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Love the new updated design with 5.0 just lacking dark mode otherwise a this is a must have app.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It saved alot of time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great update"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The app is a great tool to have. But I don't like your recent app refresh. Feels less user friendly than the previous one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for split expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrong calculations"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is app so useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The recent update is making me consider delete the app. The previous version was cleaner, more user friendly and I was recommended to everyone! Please make the older and new version an option. I really enjoy your app, but if don't change anything about this new version, I'll move to another app, I'm sorry :("
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App can not sync any data , they show internet connection is poor, anf i also uninstall the app and reinstall the app, login not work. Worse experience day by day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"New update giving me headache Everytime if i add new expense app automatically crashing"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Needs optimization. But in general it's a smart idea for big long holidays with group of friends!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly useful app to split the expenses . Awesome design. Easy to use, most helpful app and a must app between any group of friends. Initially started using for trip, now using everytime we friends meet"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Could be great but forces you to invite friends instead of just adding a name to a list. Really ruins it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"can use it without invitation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very thought process idea"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for more than 3 years now and is been a great tool to simplify expenses split and record keeping. Kudos to the developers"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This is a nice app but the main limitation is it does not tell you how much amount each person owes to one another in a group. I used splid app and that works just fine ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I used to love this app. However, now it shows wrong break ups and calculations. I have even emailed the support team, but no reply yet. Edit : Got reply from support team. Issue resolved. Thanks."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This application makes live so much easier. I really recommend this application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage the expenses when you live in a shared accomodation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful for trips. Thank you"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice way and old way of splitting and recording expenses. One recommendation - The person who was supposed to pay deleted the group and thus expense was deleted without any comments on why the expense was unpaid. There could be some control of that sort for maintaining the authenticity of the expense and tracking it well or in other words without commenting the group shouldn't be deleted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for handling finances during group trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I don't know if you guys are updating this app now . Because your all functionality in app is not working currently. I tried many times to add but everytime i showed settled by default ."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to manage expenses in group. Its really useful for calculating the expenses and maintaining the share within group. Loved it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"My housemates and I loved this app but updates have made this so buggy! Settling balances in a group doesn't settle it with people over all and it makes random enteries when you settle up to the point where we no longer trust the app with our finances and no won't be using it any longer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Life made easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really really horrible app, adds amount automatically, don't download there are much better apps. 2 boys fought because of stupid balances added by splitwise itself"

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"There should be confirmation from other partner after giving payment then it would be settled... only"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Doesn't accurately tack-on or deduct group expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There is no 1 point settlement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Makes keeping track of shared expenses so simple. Easy to use. Highly recommend."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It is very very helpful. We used this app during our trip and was too good. App is easy to use and it has good interface. Best app to split money."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app.very useful.best features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Paid for pro - charged monthly but not getting benefits of pro. Have gotten no recourse to get my money back. Tried to cancel subscription through Google play as suggested but it's not on any of my google accounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply the best. This makes group trips and apartment living so much easier and less stressful for everyone. It links up really nice with Venmo and has a clean and smooth interface. I would highly highly recommend this app to anyone who has to split costs or plan a group trip of any kind."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really amazing app, specially for group travellers and hostellers, it makes your daily routine so easy you cant imagine, also there is one functionality for sattlement thats really great feature to reduce transactions among group."

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app, it runied our 15 years of friendship and many beautiful memories."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Thought I canceled but they still charged me. I tried to message them for a refund and silence. It was only a few days after being charged but still nothing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Showing wrong settlements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I would give one start because here you can't delete your expense. Once you have added anything your account will be forever with them. You won't understand this now but in future you will regret for using this app so don't use it when you can't control your own account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb.... App Bachelor ke liye no. 1 Paise ka Koi chod chillm nhi.... Because transperancy is the best feature of this app... So let's use... 👌👌👌👌👌"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app...so easy to use...makes splitting bills so easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not showing total spendings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best and awesome 😍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Doesn't have the option to settle up individual expenses. Every time an expense is added it gets mushroomed into a collasal amount. Why make things so complicated?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best application for dividing expenses among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app Wrong calculation Showing settled up without any settlement 😠😡"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to organize finances between friends and family."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App... Thank you so much Splitwise... You are making life more simple... Lots of 💕... Carry on 🔥🔥🔥..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Seemed great at first but as we started using it, there were multiple times where expenses were added and not split properly. Taking the expense off of one person and not others even though when when we went into the expense the split was showing correctly. Tried reinstalling, with no success. Maybe there is a glitch somewhere in the app for either apple or Android? Our group has a mix of both. Could be a really great app if it worked."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Babal Cheez Bnaye Ho"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bakwas"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very confusing user experience, need to create an account."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I can't check the individual expense breakdown for the total amount that I need to settle up. Nor can I mark individual expenses as paid. That's dumb."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The only suggestion would be, bring upi payment as a payment method as this is hugely used in India and would be very beneficial while settling up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Use it with roommates for expenses and it works wonderfully, no annoying ads or begging for premium."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application. Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app! Have been using this with my girlfriend and it has been so easy to keep track of what we owe eachother. Thanks!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app helps save all the fights and arguments over splitting expenses during a trip. Thank you for the good work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good for quick record of money and any other expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull app in playstore use it for no awkward feeling about giving and taking money for ur daily expenses with ur frnds without misunderstanding......tq playstore"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's mostly good, but it would be great if there was a way to see who owes what. For example, in the simplify debt video there's a picture with the 5 people who owe each other with arrows pointing between them. If I could see that, but in my groups it would be great!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Only If I got to know this app sooner. I would have fined all my friends unknown amt that they forgot"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst experience I have deleted an entry but it couldn't deleted"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awsm 😇 Try it once,u won't regret it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Incorrect calculations are shown"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for calculations of expense"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Saviour 😉"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app has made my life easier. As bad I as I am at managing shared expenses, more often than not I used to forget expenses and who was involved when. This app handles everything seamlessly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best group travel app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for a couple years now and love it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Would be nice if you integrate payment into the app. Like Paypal or Revolut"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome way to manage combined expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have used this app since last 6 years and it is the most useful app I have found so far for managing payments for trips."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I don't know but it always get crashing the time I open the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a best app when you go with someone in a trip. I love the way it work and each a every paise is counted here.. Loved it very much ❤️❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Appears to *require* each person to have an account. I would like to use to calculate for my own tracking with another person who doesn't do apps. This is common when I travel too, a couple of us will track things while another might be tech incompetent or just flakey. I should be able to put in a non-active person to split with, give me the option to add their email and share with them later"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worth it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, just makes it so easy when doing spendings in a group or trip... Would really love if the could include UPI payments from within the app itself..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application with user friendly interface and does what it advertise. I have been using this app from many years and found all calculations to be accurate. People who believe sometime calculations are wrong really need to understand the features/ options they accidentally activate."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I am using free version of this app, and it is very good, saves a lot of time. Pro upgrade is recommended for a big group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This app Is great but one feature is missing. Please add total expense in group trip feature. Where user can see how much money has been expended in single trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Why isn't there a button to pay for an expense that has just been added to a group after opening the notification? If you're opening the notification, chances are you want to pay off that debt. Why make it so hard to do that?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would be good if Date can also be entered."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Damn, wish i knew about this earlier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to use with housemate and friends. P.S. Love the bunnies"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Sooper way to keep tabs"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, don't think I've ever gotten any ads. It just works."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best way to track all the expenses and share with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice app but problem to divide a number like 30.55 between 2 persons and decimal limited to 2, error in division"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"What an amazing app to settle up expenses with others. I highly recommend this app to someone who is going on a trip with friends."

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise was working fine earlier however now it aborts unexpectedly after I try to open. Not able to use at all. So will not like to recommend anyone.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is a life saver when it comes to spending in groups. It allows everyone to contribute equally no matter who pays at the time of payment. Let's all take some time to appreciate the logic behind this app in automatically adjusting balances between group members."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Interface is quite complex and gets difficult for users to use it also the currency doesn't remains the same once used"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"BUG FIXS"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app easy to manage splits"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is the best for keeping track of funds between friends. I no longer am the friend that is out $100 after paying for little things here and there at festivals and never getting my money back. Great for roommates and house expenses too. Highly suggest it!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Eita gote banda app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst UX"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app But my problem is why is this app not giving notification? When someone is updating our Expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"super bad calculation. I had to calculate again for each of my friend to get the correct amount. This app can only work as a notes app for expenses. It wrongly added more expense to one friend, and removed from other. Friend 1 owes me 2500, but the app says 1500. Friend 2 owes me 4000, but the app says 3000. The total adds up, but individual's expenses are wrong. How can just adding numbers be messed up?. I could have just used a notes app instead of this. Uninstalling after CALCULATING MANUALLY"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"A good app. Once understood how to use it is very useful for daily and the travel trips. The simplified payment can get a little confusing but it is useful. Recommended"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Lost $50 transfer from a friend. Multiple emails over a month have resulted in nothing. App support blames others for the lost cash. Use a different cash transfer app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great idea but not very intuitive to use. Needs everyone to know how to use the app and for everyone to pay a lump sum at the end otherwise the smart payment feature ends up being a nightmare"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please give our expenditure in pdf but it taken in excell"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I was sceptical but it is so useful when you're in a group. Takes off what you have put in off of everything you owe either the group or just specific people in the group. Eg. Drinks for you and one other person on a group holiday, you pay, and 50% of that (what the 2nd person owes you) gets taken off what you owe the whole group kitty, and put on what they owe the group kitty. Means you avoid disputes and confusion."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really amazing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app just simply malfunctions. Math is not at all reliable. I lost some of my money to it. Terrible stuff."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app from more than 1 year, and I can say that the overall experience has been great. The app comes with a simple design, easy to use interface and real time synchronisation across all the contacts which opens the door for transparency too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Splitwise is not working properly, it not dividing the amount equally(in our case 4 people), it adds the amount to only single person(member of the group) and not adding the amount to other guys."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. Takes away so much of your headache while on a trip/get together with a big group of friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"The apps keeps repeating, splitwise keeps stopping. Close app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Same issue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"No need to stress about splitting, this is it! How much each spent / divided done!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Loving this app.Very helpful in keeping track of money split. One feedback, chat option should be there to ask about money related query to the person with whom we are splitting money."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Super helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Even if the other person has an account, the app does not show it. This is just height of stupidity in the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App ui hard to use, makes u add people or pay premium to do anything."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We enjoyed this app thankyou developer"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect for splitting costs with 2 or more people, hopefully stays free, please add a dark mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice"

"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App doesn't sync groups activity at all. Need to always use the web version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why you wanted to download my contacts? It is unethical"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This is good but the expansion delete option should be only for that member which add expansion this is a bug because other member can delete it easily any time and do frod any time."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Satisfied"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple and intuitive, using it for 5+ years now. Needs a dark mode though!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good to manage expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Meh... Decent app but too many obvious things missing for something that isn't rocket science. The app doesn't remember currencies so will default to USD all the time. Also won't let you add refunds/reimbursements."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent application for group expense management and some features are relly very helpful and unique. It made my hostel Life easy. And now we are using it in office groups, family groups to keep our splits sorted. Just loved the application.❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great little app to keep track"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App that works just right!!!"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful in splitting bills among group of people. Best app if you live with flatmates and need splitting of bills, groceries etc"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect for students with roomates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Need to improve like ui and other special features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful when you have a group of people and you went to any trip where keeping track of all the spending is very difficult. Splitwise makes it much more easier to keep track of all your spendings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Hum log se nahi horaha hain"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"working too slow"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app! Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, beeb using it since ages now. Dev pls release the dark theme addition!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Godsend. Essential when you're living in shared housing. With this app, it's very easy to keep tabs on who owes who what. For example, I loaned one of my roommates laundry money worth 3 dollars. I put that on Splitwise. He doesn't have to pay me right away, as it's expected that I would get that value back somehow, which I did. I borrowed a couple of cans of tuna from him a few days later, essentially paying his debt off and not needing multiple transactions between us. Very helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a month with close circle is friends, and it's quite user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good for hostelites"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exceptional!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience. Highly recommended. Very useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bugs. Saying I owe all the funds to one person in a group when multiple people log expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good for splitting the expenses between friends. But In groups there must be an option for searching and filtering the expenses.!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App. But need to do better payment integrations like Gpay."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Individual person expenses on the end of each month. Net expenses of each person on the end month."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not intuitive"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing everytime I try to create a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It doesn't calculate how much one owes to other in one shot. Instead it shows how much you owe the other and how much the other owes you. Very confusing settlement"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Sooo much better than Steven App. Works flawlessly, I use it to keep track of home expenses with my partner. I always use on during trips with friends as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"good as of now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just provide duplicate contacts merging. Feature"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one for all bachelors to manage their expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Sending Reminder facility to WhatsApp and gmail should be given."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything is nice except the final net calculation. If you are paying cash to settle up it doesn't reflects accurately. Having managed a expense group for 9 months had to export the spreadsheet and do the calculations manually to prove what each one owe to each other."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"should add the option to pay from within the app itself..through googlepay or phonepay"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Super easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"بهترین سرویس برای حساب کتاب‌های شخصی و محاسبه دنگ و دونگ"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the must-have applications. Very useful, nice user experience, I've never experienced a malfunction."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent Application for Group Expenses And Management."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good for sharing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very useful app, don need to memorize all calculations & common expenditures"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have app for going on vacation with others and sharing expenses. It's very easy to use, pretty straightforward and at the same time has all the options you need. Bravo! Perhaps you could even make it possible to sync the data with money tracking apps, so each one can add their individual expenses to their tracking app. Just a suggestion to make it even more awesome. Keep up the great work!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app to track payments. I request two more features: 1. UPI payments like Google Pay, Phone pe 2. Add user without providing mobile number and email. Just to track our expenses with people who are not on splitwise."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I added my friend by his mobile number and when i changed his details with email ID all the transactions are gone now. Only total amount is visible."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A bit confusing, but overall great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We make lots of group trips and this app made our job easy to split costs. No more excel spreadsheet with formula"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I don't trust it. Not sure how $44 between 3 people ends up being $32 for one of them, $0 for another, and $12 for me... this happens a lot, the amounts really just don't add up. Before that expense, one owed me nothing ($0) and the other ($32) owed me $3 so it's not like I'm missing past records :/"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"It transfer money owned to other people in the same group and only displays settled amount without showing the actual amount owned. This is not transparent and could cause lots of trouble when someone enters a wrong entry."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful must try☺️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for splitting bills with your roommates, doesn't fail and no ads, very pleasant. 5/5 would always install again."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great when your pal is a tight arse."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent at what it does"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I would give it 4* only because from my expirience it doesn't work with Germans in group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't let you do basic analysis like spend data , category etc unless you pay ..this is provided for free in their competitors apps ,why would I pay here for that ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Need to improve"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wow great app, I just had a thought to design this app and this is exactly what I envisioned. Could not have made it better myself."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome App.. One Suggestion: make a video to explain simplify feature in details in more Indian way. It's very difficult for me to explain it to everyone that this feature is better😔😔"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please ADD UPI in settle balance section along with Paytm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"If I make a new group I'm not the member of the group anymore after adding my friends in the gp I created .. all the hps hide from the groups where was only the activity section shows all the expenses happening in the gp (that is created bye but it doesn't show up in my gp column)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good application for review hisab kitab"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall great app, would be excellent if the app consists of wallet or could linked to bank account. Hope this should be considered and solve."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for three months. Splitwise is very help to organize the spending among cluster."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Bets app to manage group expenses. No need to manually calculate expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great idea. However, the user interface is very confusing (especially when splitting entries) and in the end we had more discussion about data entry and interpretation than necessary. Next time, it's pen and paper again."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Application is Good but I have one suggestion for you .. If possible one option that calculat our month extra expense.. we add daily expenses there .. and it is helpful for monthly money analysis ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Its an awesome app,would be great if you integrated UPI payments into the app for your indian customers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Expenses are getting mixed up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's super easy to use and gets the job done. A lot of options on how to split shared costs, which is great. I just discovered there are some monthly stats, which is helpful. I've been using the basic version for years."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hi Dev Team, One really good feature you can add is to display a small calculator on ""Add Expense"" activity. If we have multiple items, instead of adding different records or using another calculator app...your little calculator will be alot helpful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I get notifications. As soon as I open it and read it, afterwards still showing as Not Read(As yellowish background). 🙁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Contact compulsory, why? Why can I not use this without adding contact (email/mobile) of the others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life simple 🙂"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily sends notification SMS and email to group asking everyone to install the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful app which is very good for the primary intended purpose of tracking and splitting shared expenses (used on a group holiday and it was very easy to use for all of us). Highly recommended. For some reason it tends to default to USD even if a different currency has previously been set - it would be a good to be able to set a preferred currency per group for instance so it doesn't constantly revert to USD."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrongly set the balances between members in one of the group created (very disapointing as this is the main functionality of this app and it is not working correctly )"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Please allow adding people as local debtors without a need to put an email address or mobile phone number, since it's quite annoying that the app creates a catalogue with just you as a member. Edit. Love this app, but I'm a big opponent of subscriptions, so a one-time payment for a lifetime premium access would be sweet."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"very helpful..happy to have"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome App. Made the distribution of money so easy and less stressful. Just one advice, If you add more payment gateways then it will be perfect. Thank you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Having a summary of all things like spent, received, month wise and bar graphs of spendings will be great."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app does its job well. May consider going for the premium subscription if my usage intensity grows. The pricing seems reasonable for the benefits offered."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exceptional for roomates"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just a great app and tool... haven't checked out any other feature you gotta pay for, but I'm sure that's great too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Exelent app. I will give them 5 star if they will add a plus sign (+) so i can add a lot of small amounts together instead of nowing how much it all cost together before."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Must have for roommates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Exactly what you need"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It would be great if you could simply just include names and amounts and split. It makes you set up details for each user. Not very useful for a quick breakdown."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This app send messages to your contacts illegally without telling you. My friends are asking me why I send reminder messages so frequently. This makes a bad impression among friends. NOT RECOMMEND"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP. Live with 3 other roommates and we split all utilities and some food and this app makes my life super easy. The app itself is very clean looking, incredibly easy to use, many features to keep things organized. I do wish you scanning recipets was free, but I understand why it's not. Would be nice to have 2 groups but if one person is in both groups the balance combines. Because then I could have 1 group with my roommates and with my boyfriend who also lives with me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome app but a concerning lack attention given to user requested enhancements. Have to wonder why the robustness of the app continues to suffer for more than 6 years..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for so long and it was working good, but today I found glitch. This app is not calculating and dividing correctly and messed the whole calculation."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Garbage.. nothing but a headache. So many mistakes"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app is soo german."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for splitting up costs between friends and family. One feedback I have is to add number of members in a group to be visible in group settings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb app very useful Enjoying it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Since I last updated, if I settle a payment which someone owes me, it starts reflecting that I owe the same amount to them. It happened multiple times. Kindly check"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful for trips with friends !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, very helpful indeed ❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"eased our lives, love it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've used SW for the last 3 years. It's great for group expenses. No headache of splitting amounts. It's excel export feature is also very useful when you want to share the expenses with someone outside SW or the group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best App for Dutch system"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app for keeping track of money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It tracks all ur expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"How the F*** do I pay people!!!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great for dividing up bills at restaurants afterwards. Use it mostly for settling up rent/food/utilities with roommates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app. Need some updations like group expenses should also be details as individual."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Please add a dark mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very good 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app but for the reminder i think there should be a reminder via app notification also!!."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Started using the app when it was completey free. Works well and helps to keep track of money among friends. Thanks for that. But the app is too large for the job it does."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Worst app... Even after added expenses in splitwise it was not showing in friends list. Because of the I have lost so much money"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mast hai"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"There are no negative expenses, important for can deposit. At least in germany."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its great for those who don't even math"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A must have app if you go on a trip with friends or colleagues."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bad interface, not intuitive. This app doesn't do anything you couldn't do with pen and paper, but is unnecessarily complicated. Edit: I complained before because I couldn't remove my duplicate from a group. Now I'm back in the group (after leaving, deleting my account and reinstalling). Was fine at first, next day the balances I owe are completely different! Like I'm being charged interest? No one in group made any changes, the grocery totals are same. Friend has same issue. We're all baffled."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Обожаю"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app for managing expenses of flat sharing & trips"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"When an item is split with all members of a group, it would be great if it remained that way even after adding a new person to that group. it forces you to update every line item to set them again to split with all members..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Genius. This app is perfectly designed and intuitive, and a huge help in splitting and tracking costs with housemates."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Mines data. Very bulky. Use Splid instead."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Not safe"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Just one suggest from my side is that, opposite party should NOT have access to settle up our balance."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is an amazingly helpful app, especially if you have to split costs between a big group (eg holidays with friends, with multiple payments from different people). It is also very helpful if you generally tend to loan/borrow to/from multiple people and feel like you're losing track..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just one thing.....give option of amount owe or lent statement send by whats app or sms .....it will be a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. appreciate it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nbc co o"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good concept"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic app for sharing and settling expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Issues with group expenses, doesn't add up correctly, says you owe money to the wrong person and general layout of the app is confusing and overcomplicated!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app! I recommend"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for splitting, streamlines mind numbing calculations. On the top of it, it has a great interface!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app save my life, trips, and friendship. You can add the receipt directly when you settle up."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent- This is what i expected as a simple tool"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"need to create an account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Always have server issues"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect and easy, saves a lot of effort and time"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Initially it worked well but after 3 to 4 months the app started giving wrong figures of total shared expenses. It showed all the records of our transactions correctly but the finals figures were all wrong. I hope that developers will look into it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes life easier when you want to split bills..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"I'm using this app from last three years and it's really worth it. I have also brought many of my friends and colleagues on this app. I have a wishlist that there should be auto adjustments within a group between different group mates weekly or monthly. Also non group expances shouldn't be there or there should be an option to delete all non group expances at once like deleting a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app makes splitting expenses with roommates a breeze with no more guesswork on who owes who what. Whether you're splitting the cost of groceries, someone orders something for you on Amazon, or you buy food for the roomie's cat, this app makes it easy to attribute or split expenses all while tracking the information on a monthly bases. It's very helpful if you're trying to work on setting up a budget for yourself, because you can see exactly where your expenses are going."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Hey guys, you just nailed it. This app is awesome. As time passes, I find myself using it for more and more purposes. I use both versions, this one and the web one. Flawless. On the other hand, I'd really pay a monthly fee only if it cost was less than a dollar. I'm from Argentina and here, in the third world, earning a dollar cost a lot of effort. Well, thanks for all the well-done work. Keep rocking!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent App😎"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Api not working"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We see problems silly but It will be messy when it comes to dealing with those. This the best app to use for clearing the doubtful money sharings."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"I like most of the functions of this app but EVERY time I try to PayPal someone via SW I get stuck in a 10-20 min long ""select all photos with x"" security captcha nightmare. no other app I use PayPal with does this to me! It makes me want to smash my phone"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Really helpful during trips with 2 or more people to keep track of the expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"For an app whose purpose is to split bills, it's not REMOTELY intuitive how to get to the ""pay this person back"" page. No, I don't want more graphs of previous payment trends, I just want to pay my half of the bills and be done."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"App is crashing in the loading screen"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app to manage all the group expenses and shared payments."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Fantastic tool - use it for all trips with friends and family."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"A bit of a bloated app if you want to do simple bill splitting between a group. Entering an email address and phone number for everyone you're adding to a group is required unless you use their website to add group members. This limitation is a huge pain as one person may want to tally all the expenses on their phone. Switched to Splid and it allows multiple people to collab edit expenses with no registration and just a group code."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This app is good. Add a calculator option at some page where we add expenses. I should be paid for this suggestion 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing how many features it offers in the free version of the app! I've been using it for more than one year! Totally recommend!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"1 ch number app bhwa."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very usefull app for daily use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app. However, when configuring bill split, input fields are uncomfortably narrow."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for bachelor who leaves together n for trips accounting too."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really great app. It helped a lot when on a group holiday with 5 friends. We used it to split various things such as car fuel and hire, meals out, drinks in bars and groceries. At the end it's easy to work out who owes what and settle up. The user interface has also been well designed. Thanks Splitwise!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dear Splitwise team, This app worked awesome for really long time......til yesterday.. And nos it has started deleting my old records...today it messed up few payments as well...It is no more reliable now"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since from almost 3 years and its easy to use . Especially while keeping a track of all spends and easy to divide umongs the friends. And no need to frequently intimate them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Oh what a life saver. For years my roommates used the most frustrating system which was basically not keeping track because eventually everyone will owe everyone. Then about every 6 months get together to ""settle up."" Finally my headache is gone and the record of everything is all in one place! I do wish there were links in the app to explain the simplify debt thing at a spoon fed level. I've had to try to explain this feature to my roommates every month so far.. 🙄"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"useful application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"If I set up a bill, the people who owe me the money shouldn't be able to delete the bill."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very useful app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great super convenient easy. A shared list function would make it rock"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's probably great for splitting up money owed for group things like restaurant outings or trips. It's less great for splitting bills between roommates as it does not allow you to settle up (or even just flag as paid!) specific items, only the total amount owed. As such, when looking at the list of bills, you can't tell what has already been paid and what hasn't. Edit: Keep getting stuck in verification loops when trying to settle up using PayPal. Might as well not use the app at all."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"If u wanna track your expenses, when u r mostly with group of friends.... This app is kind of the best...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to delete the account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super fast, responsive, and helpful. The app allows splitting payments quickly. Keep up the good work, team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Most useless app ever downloaded. Its not easy to use , keeps confusing where to add and how to split . Other apps are way easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The perfect app for sharing house or trip expenses!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It should have settle up through payment options like upi NetBanking debit/credit card etc . Features"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Edit date and time and some separate pay.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"In the first and second batches of expenses and settlements logged, the system's computations were correct. But then after the 3rd batch of logs came in, and we saw the balances to settle up payments, the system was not charging the right amounts from different people. One of the group members would owe really high amounta to another group member while the another member does not even owe anyone but in reality and based on the exported logs, each person owes everyone else"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Perfect for the purpose"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This application is very useful for student and etc. Moreover, who student are live together( room sharing), while expence management are to difficult or hasitated, but when I start use this application expence management are easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, use it all the time when travelling with friends. Thanks a lot!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"How to delete an wrong entry ??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Got the most use out of this than almost all my other apps. Only a couple things I wish it had: - Dark Mode - If there were a non-subscription Pro option I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Seems more geared to corporate clients atm - Sometimes the invitations can be glitchy and produce duplicate group members, if you add using both email and phone number. QR code feature is great tho"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good App.but i need one thing,when we are 4 persons and have a option to add 4 persons payment to set a record on Daily Basis on all group members.when admin add today expense it will be option who paid or splits equally or not... Meanwhile good App"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"It's ok, but the free version a little bit confusing when dealing with multiple currencies. Not worth to pay for if used only occasionally."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Less useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"thanks for making my life easier"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its not opening on Samsung s10 mobile"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Everybody had trouble connecting, finding the right group etc... It was more exhausting than helpful at the end."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Extremely glitchy, bad user interface. Will never use again. Entire app is full of errors!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"When I opened the excel sheet after 7 months, I became fan of this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This one of the useful app in the store ."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good aop"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Couple of features are needed to improve overall UX: set budget, weekly overview."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application, it bifurcates currencies too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and does what it says it will!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I do not want to share my contact details to 3rd person app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Sometimes it screws up the balances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best app for finances. Extremely easy to share bills, like trips with friends, domestic expenses, etc. Strongly recommended."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bahut hi jhaatu app hai Ek week ke baad barak Obama hamare family grp me add ho gaya tha apne se Ye app full corrupt hai Rahul Gandhi jindabad"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very compact and easy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It's good for flat sharing people"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unable to use if i don't want to add some member's contact details rather than just his name. Pathetic."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has been a great way to keep records of items you purchase and divide with your roommates. If you live in a shared flat/pg/hostel you must have this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for sharing expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing!👍"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazingly useful. Very easy and works how you expect. I wish I could support the dev other then a subscription as I don't need to features for that cost."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely magnificent! Being able to settle with crypto would be even better. Keep up the good work."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Why can't I add negative expanses (income)?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Don't like subscriptions. Looking for alternative"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect way to share expenses with my partner!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect for splitting costs while travelling. Easy to use and very good UX. Recommend it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and efficient. I like both in-app notifications and emails sent. Gg"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful and convenience."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Monthly subscription is killing this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to use for friends, travel buddies, apartment mates, party planning and any other type of group to split and track expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible UI, why make such a simple thing complicated? And you want to charge people for it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Without this App 🤗, We're unable manage the monthly expenditure. Really it keeps me tracking money. It helps whom you lent and owe. Can't ask more than this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's good to have an application like this"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very Good Application"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. But only the person posting entry should be able to edit or delete the expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app...nice..I recommended it to my flatmates too... keep going"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Difficult and confusing to use, especially for splitting rolling bills (like utilities) among a group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A feature I needed apparently requires a subscription, which I was not made aware of in the promotional information, a shame. This review would likely be 5 stars, if i didn't have to pay to set custom split percentages, which is a pretty basic feature if you ask me."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great solution for splitting expenses with your buddies on a road trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Under notes, if we give a list format where we can add the items will be useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Used to work fine but it dont divide equally in groups."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Helpful..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfectly does it's job!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"While the maths is made easy, clicking ""settle up"" implies that a payment is sent when all it does is erase the amount owed. This has lead to huge confusion every time I have used the app with friends. Further, the default currency is Canadian dollars which also confuses amounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Best in business"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Font size is big... Its irritating. Theres is no option for changing that.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very simple and useful."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Really not helpful this app is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"One great app! Should have the option to set the currency permanently !"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Shows wrong calculated amount"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Not functioning properly in oneplus6 mobile. Using website version to access data😬"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I had been using it since a long time. But now no longer need it in lockdown. How do I delete my account? I thought that's a basic feature of any app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Need to sign into google to use it. Why? Don't get it."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for my appartment expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it says it does. If you live in a flat or house share it's exactly what you need!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Overall the app is well done and full of feature, but a lot of time I am frustrated because I can not select the hour, and so the expenses are not well sorted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for keeping records for transactions with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gogogo 21 ago"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app. Though I wish you guys would create theme options. A dark one would be great. Tks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great App! A little bit difficult to figure out at first but once you figure it out, it's super convenient and nice to have when rooming with others and splitting expenses all the time. Even has convenient ways to make payments through the app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dark-Mode feature required. And also settled up option for individual transaction is required. For example if I paid for pizza for my friend. When he settled pizza amount then there should be an option to settle only pizza amount."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"No Dark-Mode"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dark-Mode feature request ticket raised 2 years ago. Still it was under review. Why don't take care about tickets?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Dark-Mode feature required. And also Instead of overall settle up option, give settle up button for individual transaction. Also update add partial payment option too for each transaction."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app to make spending accountability among friends or family's ...."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app It will save your time, no need to worry about your expense. We are 4 room partners and now we are enjoying this app . Thanks for making life easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Quite useful application."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very efficient and useful. Can be used for spitting the bills with 1 person or with large groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Use every day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very good at expense tracking once you get the hang of it. Not the most user friendly right out of the gate. Venmo integration is terrible, figure out the totals you owe or are owed and ""settle up"" manually."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"We used this app to keep up with wedding shower expenses between 7 hosts. Worked like a charm!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've used ever. Awesome."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App crashes every time I want to switch to Groups"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"From someone who pays for the whole group during night outs and out of town trips, this app helps me in knowing how much is owed and who owes who without the hassle of writing things down and asking if they already paid. The whole gang has this app and I can say that our lives are easier with this."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awasome application. Managing my room expenses from 6 months."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easiest way to split money. Best app to reduce our head ache of splitting the each shares.. loved it.. using it from past 3 years"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful app..kindly comsider adding upi payments too"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very useful!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The algorithm is great and the features are really awesome. Please try to partner with UPI systems like Google pay or Phonepe also as in India, not everyone uses Paytm. If we can directly transfer the money using UPI from this app itself, it'd be a great way of settling split amounts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Its not managing correctly. Added amount for one settles up the other person. How can that happen?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helps me so much in tracking what I owe people! Makes me a better person who always settles up on anything I owe :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app works great for me. Excellent features."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good to go"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's very useful. It is helping us to maintain healthy relation with flatmates .Main benefit is it's process of calculation and way of time saving."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Report feature can be added. Can be used as expense manager also"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The free version is good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"This is junk"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easiest way to split the check, regroup travel expenses within a group and follow couple's expenses in our day-to-day."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Boleh juga lu"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Currency option should be open easily"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This is a must have app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good application to control the debts with other persons."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Is there a option to settle up with partial amount?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to manage our expenses.."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for few years and it always worked well. However, past month or two it just keeps crashing after every update. I am able to open the app but it crashes when I attempt to add an expense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Soooo busted - it just keeps contorting the numbers, not accurate at all. Somehow it now says my friend owes me and I didn't even enter anything!!! I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"REALLY HELPFUL specially if you are going for a trip."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy, simple & convenient app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app is very useful for the one who is very conscious about their expenses like me"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Total non Intuitive UI."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"A great app to split expenses with a group. Links directly to pay pal or venmo."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for use love it ❤️❤️❤️"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrost app. A simple mathematics can't done by a app. My expense was goes into another person account. Don't trust tha app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Bhangar app e BC gandit ghalun ghya te"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Cool app to manage the bills among friends."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app to manage expenses among friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Clean, intuitive interface. The features on the pro version are handy, but the free version is still very good."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"A good app that could be a great app. The date needs to be shown in the line of the expense without having to drill down to see when the purchase was made. Also the date does not show fully next to the calendar icon when loading an expense, this on a Samsung Note 9. Both these issues are just sloppy design. Update: Email was sent as requested on 30/06 as requested. No acknowledgement nor reply."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Everything is okay with the app. It only misses an option do to notes and grocery store list 😁.So i can do that with my roommate"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just the app I was looking for..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Useful !!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track and custom distribution of the shared bills."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app and a shame me and my girlfriend only started using it recently (we were using spreadsheets prior!). The free version has more than enough functionalities and super fun and intuitive to use. Well done dev team!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does its job perfectly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Couldn't figure out how to split the rent pmt for 4 people with widely different sqft. But the developer reached out to help. We got a different apt so I didn't need it anymore. But great customer service."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Though I have proper internet connection, it showing unable to connect, It's happening for every page. Account settings page is also showing some api ans throwing message unable to connect"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"One of the must application for the mobile. BUT not as per the splitwise standard. Still miles to go."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Good to use in groups and maintain credits/ borrowings"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good and helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The app does have some issues with Android only on Sony phones however I reached out to the development team and they were able to.come.up with a solution in a very time bound manner. Excellent support and really fantastic app to track and spilt your expenses. Keep it up team."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app, Easy to track expenses if we are spending with the multiple members. It would be better, if we able to see date along with monthly expense details."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Great premise but the user experience is atrocious. Super handy for sharehouse and other shared expenses but they could benefit from getting some UX/UI help."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very good application for personal expence maintenance"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I've been using Splitwise for at least 4 years. This app is really good at what it does. I don't think a monthly subscription is worth it but I'd definitely pay $5-$10 for the app if it was for lifetime ad free and premium features The developer done a great job with this app. I'd love to join a beta program if you ever offer one"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Wish I could make unverified friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why does this thing need my contacts list!???"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"In group they dont show all the transactions between group members separately"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to track expanses on our group motorcycle rides."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.. makes calculations very very easy"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"This app is not opening properly nowadays... Getting crashed often... please see to it and rectify at the earliest..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep track of expenses you are sharing with others. So if someone buys a gift, or food and friends want to go halfers this app will keep track of that! My household uses this app for groceries and stuff"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Activity tracking is terrible... It could be more clean to figure out..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I want it in gbp"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience....."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really simple and handy. Has made sharing expenses with housemates super quick and easy. Layout/user interface is clear and pleasant to use."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Mind blowing app. You have nothing to do after using it. It will do everything for you. Forget about making note of expenses and sitting together for reconciliation at the end of each month. Here you also get compiled monthly expenses, charts and other useful data. Thanks splitwise"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Use this a lot. It's super simple and amazing for a free app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good application I am using llast t.6 year this is good"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Just great app, easy to use!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Splitwise was working fine until last update! Now it force closes the app and if I try uninstall the app, my phone will reboot and then allows to uninstall. Even after fresh installation facing the same issue"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I very much like this app."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Modern shared expense management, I would badly request to provide Archive option to hide the selected groups and contacts."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome app except for it's attempt to advertise it's paid Pro service at every corner. I'd much rather pay a one time fee for the software than to subscribe to something that I'm only going to use once or twice per year. It simply doesn't make any sense."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Gteat"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Simplify feature doesnt work properly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for any situation"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Superb App. Is there any expire ?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"love this app!!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Seems to not work at times, amounts get mixed up between groups, and the app sometimes incorrectly calculates balances on different devices. The app also looks very different on iPhone to android which can cause issues. Due to it not being 100% reliable, I wouldn't say it is usable for something as important as calculating money owed."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app while ur in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App parfaite merci beaucoup. Faites seulement pas confiance à Max max. Merci encore."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good apps to split money between friends, easy management"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app 👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"App is easy to use, very helpful and practical. One of my favorite apps"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App should allow for expenses cancellation instead of splitting every. single. Expense. I paid$50, my friend paid $50. We now have to pay each other $25. Fix the accounting."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice and clean, serves the purpose"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super useful app for splitting expenses and keeping track of money owed between friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Just siggestion, if we edit expense it is saying added, it creates a confusion that expense added twice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice to have personal cash register for free"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very helpful on keeping track shared expenses. I just hope email and number are not required when creating a group or a 'friend', since not all group members use this app. Edit: The support team provided a workaround, I can confirm that it is working. Just want to add the use case that a certain user can use the app to just keep track his/her payables and receivables without bothering the involved parties."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"I hate the special permissions that the app has. IMO, it does not need half of them."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Helps to split bill with ease"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Awesome application for tracking expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Probably the best app for managing your splits with friends and family"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Nice App. Good job guys who ever"

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It claims you can pay people. & get paiiiid! Can confirm. It does. Easily. Thoroughly well done app.The only non complaint I'd have is to not constantly be reminding me I'm not rockin' splitwise proOoOo!! C'moooooon, youre an app for money exchange. I need an average of zero reminders on how broke I am to know exactly how broke I am. Hahha 96% satire All in all, you guys at splitwise have made our house think/worry about money far less. Which is 👌clutch. payin or requesting,money sux always.Fin"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app for sharing expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. i used it with my home mate , use it with friend group and everything. i never deal with calculations everything is in the app. i wouldn't hesitate to use even if i have to pay for the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.. I remember my college days using pen and paper to do all these stuff and forgetting many after end of the month.. But this app has just made our life easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Hello Team, I was using this app since long and today i realise that there is some bug witg calculation in on of my one of group. Whenever I'm adding any expenses it's showing that you are settled up with one of my group user every time same problem occurred. Kindly please look into this asap and update and fix the bug. Thanks"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Updated app crashes at some point of view Like in activity page if we move to appropriate split balance, it's throwing error sometimes or comes out of the app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Terrible privacy problem. Personal email linked to wrong account and support staff did nothing at all to help. Do not recommend! Response to dev message: I've already had enough of my time wasted by your support. Tried that first and was totally useless. Why would I waste more time on it now? Is the result going to be different? I don't think so. That's why you got 1 star"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best to manage expenditures with friends n Completely free of cost"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Incredibly handy app to use for splitting costs with friends or to keep track of your expanses on a roadtrip. Personal QoL request: let me sort the way my friends show up by newest activity / expense instead of alphabetically"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Wrong amount!!!! I have calculated it manually and manual whereby other that should owe me 500++ ended up only 300++. This has happened so many times that I doubted the amount. Only recently when I calculated (when the transaction is easier to calculate), then only realised a bug in the app. So should I have trust issue for very record??"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Thos app is amazing. I use it all the timw and have no complaints."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's the best. User friendly. Easy options."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Does what needs to be done very well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Absolutely wonderful app. There are many such apps in market but I prefer to stick to this because it gives lot of details at ease yet very easy to operate. I remember the days when I use to write and divide the expenses with my flatmates. For me this app has come as blessing in my life when referred to me by my friend. Cheers to developers."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app to keep tabs on shared expenses"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Helps to keep household and journey hisabs in an easy way. It could be better but achieves the purpose."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Complications"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Very useful app but after installing the latest update the app would not open. Had to delete the app and reinstall."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It's been very helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Keeps moving the target payee anf this causes many confusions"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice way to manage and save records. Who borrowed money when I have to pay my emi and all other stuffs."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Effective way to manage expenses with friends during stays, trips, etc."

"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Nice app those who are leaving in shareing flat easy to get all updates of 💰"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy and convenient app. Can recommend it to anyone paying items together 😁"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Made life a lot easy! Only request is if you guys can add a feature of giving loans and also adding interest rates. We all know people who won't just pay!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Accent app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It was good but they broke it with useless ""improvements"""
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Convenient way to transparently split purchases, mostly intuitive. The only confusing part is payment methods. Don't understand why they are not in the main menu."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great for management"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good app to split ur expenses among friends, family members and colleagues.... Very useful app for the quick settlements"

"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Okkk"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really a great app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simple Excellent"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good and free app. Love it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Overall nice app.. although an option to divide the money in more available ratio would have been more helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"This is an Awesome app, but I went with walnut app for now as I'm using that for my daily financial activity."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"It works!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Unübersichtlich sondergleichen. Habe selten eine so komplizierte app gesehen. In Holland sind diese Apps deutlich besser. Ladet euch ""wiebetaaltwat"" wenn ihr was vernünftiges wollt"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good App. Easy to split expenses."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Chini Kum.....😏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Read the terms & conditions. This app requires you to allow them to download & make a copy of all your contacts. No thanks, apps for splitting costs dont need to know everybody I know."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Very helpful app, but I have a request! Once expenses have been settled up, can they be marked or change color? There needs to be a clear way of knowing which expenses were settled. Thank you!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"So far so good, there is scope for improvement."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Would have rated 5 star, great app, just one suggestion. Can you include a feature to add cashbacks or basically refunds. Wouldn't mind buying a Pro version if that feature gets added."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Used to be alright, but now things constantly show up twice, when they have only been added once. This is seemingly random and changes when you re-open the app. Makes the whole app pretty useless."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Worked well until (relatively) recently. It now shows various duplicate entries, so it's impossible to know how accurate it is."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Hello team, Could you please update an undo option for 'Simplify Debts' option"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Have used this app for four months now, and it has been great for tracking expenses with the other couple I'm traveling with through two countries. Would love to see currency conversion built into the app in the future as an enhancement. Would recommend this app to anyone splitting expenses with others."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Splitdumb Where is debt simplification for out of group members. It isn't on the app plus even on website it isn't in advance features. It is really a simple feature and should be on app. Let people decide to use it or not. Users aren't dumb. Or else change the app name to splitdumb."
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"App closes everytime when I update something and someone edits it the in few moments. After opening the app again that transaction becomes uneditable by everyone. Devs please resolve this bug."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Tricount is far better than this app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I can not say enough good things about this app! It has a learning curve but once you get it down it will save you loads of time and provide a great record of your financials with other people. It even connects with venmo! Real life saver."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Wonderful, you just add an expense or payment and it will calculate everything and keep record.. And you allways can adjust!!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"The best, without doubt"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It should work without sign just like any other similar app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very easy and straightforward to use, extremely convenient when travelling with friends"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best app for anyone interested in keeping track of their transactions."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Dark mode still missing :-("
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Why cant i add just names without email and number"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best app. So many options it gives you."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"This app is so functional! Especially for holidays with other people, it's so easy to keep track of you owes money or not!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"All things are good but, it should include option to deselect all members in group, which option is there in IOS version."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"App is crashing."
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"The app is a little confusing. Not very intuitive or user friendly."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Great app and does it what's supposed to do flawlessly. There could be some UI related enhancements. The subscription cost is quite steep, however the free version is enough for casual expense tracking. Would love if they come with a revamped payment model, as would like to have access to the search feature as well."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Quite good to settle balances"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Convenient"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Perfect application to manage account"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Super Cool App for Bachelors"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice experience"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Thanks a lot splitwise for making our Life easier and you are our time savior 🙏"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Simply the best!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good App to maintain the Split across People. One feature I wish is to add the Self Expense Tracking."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Why do you want to ""See and make a copy of Google Contacts"" ? You must pay for all my contacts. Make a proposal and I'll think about it"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really useful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Group expenses not splitting correctly...gets updated to a single person in group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",2,"Poor receipt scanning, when I scan a receipt in French, it doesn't recognize the sub-total and tax. I need to edit every single receipt entry. On top of it, the total of some receipts is wrong. When there's a recycling fee (or more than one) on a grocery receipt, these are not calculated in the total by Splitwise. You are charging premium for this feature and I expect nothing less than a flawless scan. At 40$ CAD/year, localizing your OCR should have been part of your initial roadmap."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"It is a great app for splitting bills, for trips, apartment, etc. It is must. The interface of the app looks a bit out of date."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very handy, specially whet you have a bunch of unorganised friends 😊"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"I have been using it from lat 4 years and it's been awsome. No issues and simple interface to use. Thank you for keeping my daily life sorted."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Like the app :)"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very good app to mange and share expenses in a group"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Good fr Daily Expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great for splitting trips and costs with friends. Very glad I was introduced to this app. Good for tracking finances in the sense it is good for tracking costs with friends and you can separate finances based on trips of different things however you choose to."
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"The iOS app looks better than the Android one."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Dati per niente intuitivi da leggere. Non consente di vedere le balance degli altri partecipanti."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"How can you live without this?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Ease task to divide all kind of expenses within large group."
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"Clearly it has loopholes."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Helpful app..."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Happy to use"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app, very useful for disturbing expenses in bachelor's room😅"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Can we expect a dark mode?"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Really nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",1,"It's confusing"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep up to date your finances."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice thought"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Excellent application. Makes life easier."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Works amazingly"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Only thing missing is dark mode. Please add it!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Amazing app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"One of the best applications out there"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Splitwise","Unknown",3,"Splitwise works great for splitting bills. There's one main issue with that keeps it from being a five-star app. The interface is extremely clunky. When I get a notification about an expense I have to go through three or four additional menus/clicks to get to button that lets me actually pay that expense. I realize that splitwise does different things than venmo, but it would be great if there was a ""settle all expenses from this group"" option right on the notification page."
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice and useful app. Must have for sharing the utilities and bill"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep track of all the expenses with your roommates. I didn't even know these kind of apps existed till i used it👍"

"Splitwise","Unknown",4,"Bohot helpful"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Best application for daily expenses"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Splitwise","Unknown",5,"best app for accounting"
