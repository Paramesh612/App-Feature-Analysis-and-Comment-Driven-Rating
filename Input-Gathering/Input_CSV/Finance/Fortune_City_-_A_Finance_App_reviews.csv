"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Hate subscription services. Seriously just charge me once and is be happy to pay. You need to pay $20 a year to use a budgeting setting. The whole point of a finance app. Otherwise it's just a data collection, that I'm sure is being sold, on top of ads, on top of a paid premium currency with a cute paint job.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Lots of great things about this app but I am giving it 3 stars until you fix a few issues: 1. Budget can't be changed. There should be an option to edit / delete budget 2. Data can't be erased unless you're deleting your whole account which is not possible if you're a premium user"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Ok, but veryyy weird how you spend money on a subscription that saves money. (You prob spend more than save on the subscription) It should be included in the sparkful subscription."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute, compelling and exciting enough to get budgeting. I even took a subscription to it. Though I won't deny, best to take the subscription after you have been using the app for a couple of months as you won't have any data to review otherwise"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm still not sure where this game goes so we'll see"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is near perfect, very fun and useful. I have to take points for few things, main one is that when my city got busy the application started laggin a bit and even freeze, which is kinda annoying and made me check less frequently, other thing I thought about is that I want to be able to add more label for the records, and I would love if there is a widget that will make adding record really easy. Overall I really love this app and will continue to use it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"so far it's interesting. I'm holding out for now until I get used to it to give a better review. Edit: I'm back again, and honestly still holding out for a better review of the app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to track expenses and see what you spend in a differt way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really love this app it's been a super helpful and fun way to track my expenses. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that there is no way to transfer money between accounts, the best way to do it is making two transactions, and there is no yearly option for reoccurring expenses, many subscriptions I have are set to renew yearly and it sucks that there's not an easy way to br reminded of them with this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I really like ie"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a cute app for tracking expenses. It's just missing an option to select currencies for those with investments or savings in multiple countries."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Actually surprised by how much I'm liking this app so far. Very cute and engaging way to keep track of your expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's-a fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for a couple of years now and since not too long ago the ""no expenses"" button does not work anymore, which is really frustrating. I can press it, but the app does not save that I pressed it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Apps great for tracking finances so long you keep up with it. However as noted by another review the ""No Expenses"" for any day no longer works. That is the 2 star reason, until it's fixed 2 and no more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love this app for years, it's so cute ♥️ hope you'll add Scheduled Expenses per se that will show up as notifs cuz it will act as schedule tracker as well (people will use it more) update some of the categories: A.Make a separate fit/wellness category (not ent.) B. Make a Knowledge/School Category so student friendly or books in general. And can be upgraded into Library (not ent.) C. Spiritual (temple/church) can be used for yoga, meditation or people have religion for donation/charity"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Normally this app is great! The gamefied approach makes it fun to track finances. However, the tracking has been broken over the last few days. My balance has been stuck on the same amount despite my entries. Hoping an update comes along to fix it soon.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Overall the app is great, but it's glitched on me where I can't watch any ads for diamonds, they simply won't load or it says none are available. It's been like that for months for both myself and my partner. And now we're both unable to double our daily rewards, we just get a constant loading bar and can't progress. This is especially frustrating for getting the Stonehenge buildings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"overall, this app is great and has helped me a lot! cute, fun, efficient. however, recently, I haven't been able to record ""no new expenses."" it will be checked, but when I swipe away and swipe back, it asks if I want to record the first expense of the day. there's no way to contact a former of customer support, just a bunch of new user articles to read through, so that brings my review down."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I quite enjoyed using the app to track my finaces but after deleted the app and sign in again, it seems all the past history of transactions are all gone. How can I retrieve back the old data?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app I've been telling everyone in my life about it. You can track all your expenses and track your get how much you're losing or saving. Not only that, but it makes it a fun game where you can get adorable villagers."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Campaign gives ~50 coins x 380 people recently supporting for scarecrow to visit = 19k vs target 10k. Something tells me that they're not being honest about awarding new characters."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A very helpful app. Gamifying budgeting really helps me keep up to date with things and turns a mundane task into something a bit more fun. I would like there to be a 4 weekly or two weekly option in the regular Income/Payments section though. It would make some of my regular payments more easy to track as not everything goes out on the same date each week or month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"thanks :D God bless"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"It won't even let me edit the budget unless I pay for premium? Also seems very laggy and won't let me log in. Seemed fun to motivate me to budget and keep track of expenses but the first impression is not good."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"after latest update chief financial officer dissapeared and i payed for a year???"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great App"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun concept, great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is wonderful. But it wasn't for me. If you like to gamify things and put extra effort on tracking, this is for you."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app, wish they had a more detailed option for you to record different forms of payment (CC, cash, debit)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I want to get the vip person so I will write this review"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Unable to login after register. Stuck on login. Asking to log for so many times even already choose login account. Not stable for use and maybe the developer had low tech knowledge. Learn more to make apps. 👎"

Update : Lately it has been a nightmare to merge buildings or do upgrade. I had to wait close to 5 minutes just to see the building option or just to click the update button. Please fix it. Samsung A71 here, app updated to the latest version."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love this app and have been using it on and off for years now. It's perfect for my ADHD because it keeps me engaged and gives me a serotonin boost every time I record an expense. The only thing is that it's hard to track transfers between my accounts, because it counts against my budget even though I haven't spent any money and only moved it. Please add a feature for account transfers! Only then can I give this app 5 stars :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It was great and useful in tracking my expenses. But it is a monthly thing. I hope it can be a yearly tracking app. That means ur amount for every month is carried forwarded and add up and at the end of the year. U have the yearly saving amount :) but overall it is still a great and cool app!!! But it takes quite a while and time to manage the city"

I love this app because it gives you a full view of what your monthly spending looks like and how it feels like you're playing a game. Some of the characters even give you advice on how you can spend your money better and save in certain areas!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Please help. Everything in the app is alright but I can't watch ads for the diamonds and rewards for some reason. It always says that the sponsor's busy or something like that but it's been saying it for a week now...."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really great app for tracking expenses and income. The gamification is lovely and the software runs smoothly with a user-friendly design. My one criticism is that some of the things that do help gamify the experience also have distracting elements. It would be better if they wouldn't try to keep people occupied as it might put some people off if it ends up taking too much of their time. Having said that, it is a very charming app and there is no inconvenience in using the free version."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app freeze recently, even when I try to click into setting->FAQ. It freeze when I click the gear button.

If I select USD and add the entry, all good. If I go back to other currency, and I select it and add another entry, it appears in USD even though I obviously selected it as another currency. Unless it's fixed I'm keeping the 3 stars since I need to keep updating the entries everytime I change currencies."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The app is not synchronized by time zone. So if you're in the US it will always be a handful of days to a week or 2 off. But if you're in Taiwan the time will be perfect. I've contacted customer service about this a few times. At first they were understanding and helpful. Currently they're gaslighting me about what week of the year I "" think "" it is. The subscriber benefits don't work when time zones don't match. The budget tracker shows incorrectly & becomes difficult to utilize."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Highly éducative resource even though you get to spend real money to acquire it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app works efficiently in tracking your expenses against your income. It also has this feature where you can see the trends of your expenses, and budgeting. However, these features are only available if you sub. Which is a bit ironic to me that id have to spend for a tracking exp/budgeting app. It woulda been nice to unlock the features at a certain level or if you pay in gems. I hope theyll work that out."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So fun and functional"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"My biggest challenge with using expense tracking apps in the past was that I always found it a chore to keep track of every expense. This app solves this problem through gamification."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's great! besides You have to manually add your purchases.and that I can't build more than like four houses a day. I spend more than four expenses a day. I understand you got to like slow the roll a bit to make the game last and prolong the enjoyment of building a city. but I don't know, It just feels draining since I wanna progress but It feels real slow not doing micro transactions an stuff"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"邊記帳邊建立城市很可愛，但因為鑽石有夠難取得，隨著城市越來越大，任務要找的東西也會越來越難找，每天都要花很多時間只為得到一兩顆鑽石，但是建立個高級建築物都需要10個以上的鑽石，實在很累很難有動力繼續經營下去"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute and have something to do more than just an accounting records app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like it, there's stuff to help you budget, stuff that makes it more like a game, it kind of makes me want to spend so I can record transactions to get more things instead of keeping me on track to save and spend properly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I haven't used it for very long yet, but it's such a fun concept! I've been saying that there needs to be an app that makes budgeting more like a game for people like me who struggle with it. And here it is!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Okay folks, I've been using this game tracker for well over a year consistently, here are my thoughts: It's great and simple. Very convenient! However, you need this mindset for it to help you: you are NOT trying to grow your city. You are using your city to accurately reflect your expenses. If you try to just grow your city, you'll spend more, which is silly. I love seeing the breakdown of my expenses, and this gives a clean and categorized way of doing it. It is also very aesthetic!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app has been pretty useful for tracking how much money I've been spending, but the biggest issue with it is that you can't change your monthly budget without subscribing to their premium plan. It'd keep me from listing my bills since it goes over $800 easily with rent alone, haha!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Superb application for Accounts"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"整體用起來很不錯！！少一顆星是因為還有很多進步空間，例如：1.縮放（無法放到最大觀看整個城市面貌）2.鑽石及金幣的消耗過於龐大，經常升級一兩次，就要再存個幾天，一天含廣告頂多20顆多 3.任務的收穫太低了吧....等幾個小時，得到的只有$100？！1~2顆鑽石？建議要隨著消耗的等級提升，不然到後面我升級一次要幾十萬金幣、幾10顆鑽石，只給我100有何用 4.廣告鑽石經常處於沒有的狀態，等了半天還是告訴我沒廣告可以看......以上是一些小建議，應該很多人有跟我一樣的問題，然而我知道開發APP很辛苦，所以辛苦你們了~~~加油，希望能越做越好~~~"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've only been using it for a few days but it's been really helpful. I want to get better at tracking my expenses and saving and I think this will help. I'm probably going to pay for the full version once I have money in order to really hunker down. I like that there's like full game mechanics, you can do things and have goals and tasks. Having visualisations helps me a lot, and this app is very well designed. It's calming and fun and makes it less stressful."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's alright thus far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I just started using it, but you only get rewarded for recording expenses of today, while I only need to do it once a month. I also tried to change the currency to euros, but then you still have to record stuff in dollars which it only converts to euros, so you would first have to convert your expenses to dollars with a calculator and record that number in the app so it can convert it back to euros. I'm thinking of trying a different app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm liking the app. A couple of GLARING problems I am facing. 1)No beginning balance when creating your accounts. 2)No""Transfer"" option. Outside of making an expense and an income for every transfer transaction, there isn't a simple ""transfer"" option. 3) ""income"" is the only option for adding money's to accounts? I tried putting things under misc. Or created ""gifts"" still ended up as an expense. All 3 of these problems makes your Income/Expenses look more than what they actually are. It is fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. It's pretty cute and entertaining. I do want to remember to put in my purchases because I want to grow my town. So that's probably helpful. Lol"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game makes my little ADHD brain so happy. It's a fun and cute way to handle finances that's actually enjoyable, instead of looking at a plain, boring piece of paper or a spreadsheet. I love that the city you make is totally interactive, and the type of city you have depends on your purchases. I really like the little search-and-find quests the citizens give you, too. Plus, I've been using it for years at this point. One of the best apps imo."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This app is cool and cute but I feel it may reward you for spending. Most of the ""tell you not to do it"" type stuff is blocked by pay (monthly) wall, Which is funny because this is a financial tracker app to help reduce spending."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Amazing bad, a game about saving and managing ur expensive want you to use your own savings on it. ADS are horribly everywhere. Not a pleasant experience at all. If you want to track ur expensive use ""Zenmoney"" the one with no ADS, its great."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"非常棒的記帳工具，還可以當做養成遊戲來玩"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great and fun way to track your expenses. Without the subscription, you can still use the app as is. Slightly frustrating that there are now limits on how many buildings you can build for a day and I have to do in-app purchase if I want to have fancier city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It serves the function of recording expenses well and has the cute aspect of building a little town. Essentially, every set of purchases you log by type, which you can modify if desired. You can view stats such as the breakdown of your spending. Two annoying things is that the number of villagers you can have far outweighs the number of jobs and houses, so you have mass unemployment at all times. Also, when upgrading the city, it takes many coin bank upgrades for any other upgrades."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love the app. Although I think it would be better if you can also track how much money you still have. Like, add to the record your money for the month so you can easily budget it. Other than that, the app is great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app. Easy to track my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app maybe add in a bit more detail to the spending"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"It fun and amazing app sadly u can't put how much money i have until you subscribe monthly pay :/ the app would be amazing and fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's great for tracking income but you have to be very diligent when doing it and if you want it to be accurate cannot forget a single purchase or income which can be upsetting to people who have just started finance tracking. Me for example, I missed a few purchases and I cannot change the total money that I have. It would be nice to be able to edit that as we can't always be perfect in tracking expenses and we are inevitably going to miss a few"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun as a entertainment game but using it to track budge makes a bit difficult, first there's no button (or maybe i just can't find it) to fill your total savings at the beginning, so when you start you need to actually take it as an 'income', so it makes kind of mess on the record so somehow also develop troubles when i find the numbers are not accurate and try to fix it, second if you add a category you can't deleted if you make a mistake, which a bit frustrated"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is what I have been looking for, combining real life and playing game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very fun way to do finances, I feel like the subscription is only somewhat useful. I can further specify some aspects, like wants vs. needs, but most things don't change after you start paying. Also it's a heavy push to watch ads"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its mostly enjoyable wish can add more people without needing to bulid"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Can I connect my bank so that it automatically can tell what I spent money one? Thatll be so cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Used to be great but now I find when ever i input a total amount apent from my reciepts the app adds 13.02$(or its percent based) extra to every purchase and its frustrating to not be able to change this. Is their an option to fix this?"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I really like the premise of the game. No ads, simple and cute, not to mention makes real life into a game. However, please make it so that we can earn coins in the game other than just the daily missions. Buildings are supposed to provide income but they don't seem to provide anything which makes it way too slow. Please fix this 👍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It is a cute concept and I like interacting with the citizens.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I don't think this is a heavy app, considering I have games, but it only take a few minutes for this app to burn my phone. Even my games don't make my phone overheat and I don't use my phone when charging. And also would be nice if there's more icons for the category and payment. Plus, if possible, a shopping list feature."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app, fun way to keep track of finances. I love the design and the gamified portion makes me look forward to tracking my spending. It would be great if there was a feature to transfer funds between accounts. I have to make this an expense, and add a category for income, which skews my data. It would also be nice to have a dedicated credit card feature too."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I've enjoyed tracking my every day expenses and growing my city. I'm still learning how everything functions, but so far I think it's a great tool to visualize spending!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A fun way to track finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's fun and the set up gets you to really categorize your expenses BUT it ends up rewarding your spending rather than encouraging you to save (you only get buildings to upgrade your city when you input expenses so if you don't spend anything during a day you don't make progress)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Overall a good app to track expenses."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting way to note down the daily expenses... Takes a bit of time how the game works... Noting down the expenses is very easy & simple to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far, so good. I've been looking for something like this for a while. I'll likely change my star rating after a couple of months depending on how I enjoy the CFO subscription."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's not intuitive and a bit convoluted but once you get the hang of it, it's fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Great idea of execution and i was really excited to try it. However, there are sooooo many things locked behind subscriptions that can expired. Even basic thing like set up your Budget need subscription. Had to uninstall"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Multitouch doesn't work very well. Moving around the map is glitchy."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It seems ads doesn't show up here. Can't complete some tasks (("

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Kinda cute and easy to use"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very fun and cute way to track expenses and it helps keep me on track!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love that this makes the tedious task of tracking finances more fun and colourful. A few small changes I'd like to see are being able to have automatic yearly expenses tracked (currently only weekly and monthly available) and renaming citizens (or even customize their appearance)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helps me maintain and keep track of my finances without it being a chore!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Taking notes on expenses become fun experience with cute buildings of which will be built for every tracks noted in this app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice way to gamify my finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its lovely and and the analytics are super useful!! The only thing is that it runs a little slow, even if the city is small and my phone is relatively new and there's rarely ads available. Other than that, its one of my most used apps."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Well designed app, should give us more categories"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Ive been using the app (on and off) for years now and I absolutely love it! It's cute, fun and super useful! However, lately the newest update has made the app really glitchy on my Google Pixel 6 phone. Hopefully that gets cleared up by the next update!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This makes tracking my spending/budgeting so much more fun! It feels like playing a game, but helps me be aware of my habits. Haven't had any issues with the app either :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app for making the tracking expense habit. But I hope that this app won't make people spend more often so that they can grow the city faster in the game.. Still, for me this app is better than others because it's funnier and more addicting, comfortable for making new habits. 😁 Update 05/07/2022 : I hope Fortune City has new useful features like uploading bill photos for easier expense tracking"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is makes it enjoyable to update your tracking."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Starting review: this seems very interesting, especially for my lack of commitment in keeping track of expenses... Due to my adhd it's really hard for me to remember to do this kind of task, the game-like structure of the app is very stimulant so I'm positive as for now that it'll be a huge help. Sadly I know myself so i'll update the review in the future when I know if it keeps being helpful or i'll drop it after one/two weeks. So far i'm pretty happy with it!"

One complain I have is that the interface are not smooth and lags regularly. Edited: Recently, I changed my phone and transferred my data. At first, it works as per normal then I realised that the extra categories like insurance, social and learning were gone. This is annoying as I created a new social for example, and it's treated as a different category."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Useful for keeping track of expenditure, but can be addictive so gotta be careful. Be good if they had an option to schedule fortnightly income not just monthly and weekly, but overall a good app so far."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Literally motivated me to learn to budget for the first time in 30 years."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"(Starter review) I wish there was a tutorial for the app since it's a budget tracker/game and it's really interesting but also pretty confusing. It's also really disappointing that you have to subscribe to get access to some budgeting access like creating categories Overall it's an ok app. Will update when I use it for a while."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a wonderful app and I used it everyday! Compare to other financial apps, fortune city combines grow up game and financial function together, and I have been used thia app for 37 days straight! Strongely suggested!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Hope there will be a restart option 希望有重置/格式化功能"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The game is nice if you keep watch of the city daily and manage how your buildings are built, but ever since you have to watch an Ad to complete the citizen dailies (which already take some time, so why bother and not just help the ad guy?) I have started to log in only once a day and record my expenses for the days before (obviously, belatedly.)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Some buttons at the bottom level for example 0, or next are not pressing because of navigation gesture so, please move them up a little. It's really irritating."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Honestly, the only spending tracker I can get myself to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting game at the same time encouraging me to input my expenses for record daily. I wish I could build more buildings daily though. :P"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"100% percent"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So cute! But the interface can be more user friendly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Ads are getting more out of hands, with some being more than 1 min. The app store will appear even when you click on the 'x' to close the ad. Removal of ads option is not worth paying for. It only removes the small tiny corner for the ads, while having to collect gems or collecting ""donations"" for in-game characters will require one to watch at least a 15 seconds ads (but most last as long as 30s). One advice to all, don't pay for the removal of ads, it is not worth."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Irony. I downloaded this to keep track of my money to save them. It did a good job of making me record my budget. But not really the latter.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I rate 5 stars. The quality of the game is what i like."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app!"

I was on track for the 365 days in a row achievement!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Someone finally made adulting fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've been using the free version for over a week now. I was a little worried about not getting anything if I don't record anything in a day, but they fill the gaps with parks. You also get extra buildings and citizens at time milestones. This, plus the little quests and worker resets, means I can stay engaged even if I have nothing to record, which is great for me. It's so cute and fun that I want to play with it all the time. It's the best finance app I could have ever hoped for."

I can find it on the app list to delete it but can't find it anywhere else. So I've had to reinstall it and then two days later it did it again."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I am trying to delete my account and it's impossible, you can't find the information on how to do it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Excellent expenses tracking app. Though the latest version seems to have some bug for my device (OnePlus 6T), it keeps freezing for no reason, or simply crashed at the start page. Also I think it might be nice to limit the number of visitors of my city, there are too many of them right now and maybe that's the reason why the app can't function on my phone?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's very interesting expenses tracking app. I love it even it has lots of ads :) How to unlock to merge building?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting gamification"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fortune City has been one of the best decisions I've made for starting a finance journaling for 2022! I didn't know how much I needed to keep track of my spending until I saw this app and thought,""Lemme give it a try"".I'm over 30 days consecutively using this app to record my daily expenses and income. User interface is friendly and can be learned in a few logins. The gamifying of the whole experience is very neat. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to start their financial journey!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good tracking app with a game element."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fantastic idea for those who have trouble remembering to write down their expenses, being rewarded with new buildings for each new spending entry really encourages you to take the time to log them as they happen.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy tracking my expences with this app. Growing my city helps me to remember to log my expenses and income. I wish the app had a way to also budget. At the moment it only tracks the income and expenses after the fact. I find it useful to go through expenses month by month and see how much I have to use after I've paid for everything I have to pay for (rent, bills, streaming services etc.). This app helps to determine how much I use&need money for food and other necessities."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excelente App para llevar el control de los gastos a la vez que construyes tu ciudad. Tiene opción de programar tus gastos recurrentes a la vez de diferentes cuentas o medios de pago. Muy recomendable!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I would love it if all the categories could be customised, with more income/savings categories, it's still pretty good and fun to play with. Looking forward to more inteactive elements with friends as well!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far it's a really fun way of keeping track of your daily/monthly purchases, but it feels more gamelike than business like (which might not appeal to everyone)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helpful with tracking expenses and sticking to a budget."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really nice and fun way to track your expenses and incomes."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Now i know whwre my money is going TT"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Still learning the app but it's very fun to reward me to track my money!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Feels like it makes me spend more instead of saving money... building a city every time I spend? No, I want to save money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Cute idea. But adding expenses doesn't edit your income via the app. So its pretty useless as an actual budgeting tool."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting way of keeping tabs to our expenses and budget. Kudos"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fresh idea to help tracking your expenses. I would gladly recommend this!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's nice because I get negative feedback when I spend too much online 😂 I also appreciate the game feature. Makes me use the app more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app. really helpful in tracking spending. was a 5 star. ads were optional with the salesman, but now I'm forced to watch an ad to claim a reward after helping citizens. makes me not want to be a good person and help them out. look what you've done."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"still figuring out, still funny and cute way to go through family expenses. we'll see how it goes in the long way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"addictive"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for tracking my money, the game motivates me to do this record and have control over my spending and budgeting. I have a question about, How I have control of my debts with others?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"redownloading a couple years since first trying it. still just as a wonderful and entertaining premise. i don't know if it's a software issue or just my ancient phone, but a few hours after downloading, the app will freeze upon opening any building's information. thankfully, uninstalling and reinstalling removes the problem for another few hours. this will be my third time reinstalling within 4 days. hoping this will be fixed by the next update. also, it drains the battery like a beast."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I wish there are more features for the non-premium users"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app to keep track of my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute and fun way to mark finance"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"it overwhelmed me with all the ""housing"" features and stuff. didn't think that spending money on a bus would make me responsible for some character's job and so on. too much going on, really. cute, but too much. also, why does it convert any entry back into GBP in the overview even tho i've set it to different currency? just makes life harder for no reason."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty good so far. Only app that actively gets me putting in budget and expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good for tracking expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I loved the creativity idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think it a very fun and cute way to manage my money and spending. It's very helpful. Their plant nanny app is also really helpful with reminding me to drink water."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It sounds boring and difficult to understand when it comes to other saving app. But not for this app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really fun way to track expenses! Although it does make me want to spend so that I can get the different buildings 😂 Either way, super fun and engaging app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute app just for recording your spending. I like the concept. Let's see if I continue to use it in my everyday life, continuasly. (It takes alot to keep me glued onto an app/game. It has to be really good cos I don't have a very high tolerance for games or apps and stuff. My attention span is very short when it comes to things like that). We shall see!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Makes recording expenses fun and something you want to do"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Crashing when opening. Then will open second try."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I generally don't review apps, but this one is worth it. If you're looking for a better way to track your spending and budgeting, the full version is *absolutely worth it*! Every time I make a purchase I enter it into the app, it immediately tells me where I'm at in my budget for that category, and I get to build a cute little city while keeping the best track of my money I've ever had. I don't think I have a single complaint about this app. It's so customizable and convenient. I love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'd use it more if it had an option to import data. I currently use a different app to manage my money so I don't w want to start over again."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting concept! Though can be quite confusing."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool thought of making a financial app into a game."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun to play and keep track of money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is the first time in my life (I'm not exaggerating) that I get excited to use an app, because I had a huge problem with budgeting and tracking my expenses, and I hated the apps of money management, because I felt so restrained , bored, and heavy while using them, but when I found this app, I was so happy, and I was excited the whole day to use it and register my expenses, which is so odd for me..... Really thank you, for this genius, and fun money tracking experience ❤"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"App變得越來越肥，不知道有沒解方，開啟程式也會頻繁遇到遲鈍的情形"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"可愛"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Can only add 5 buildings a day, making setting up your finances a chore esp if you download this in the middle of a month. Too many features locked behind premium (as well as a premium currency), no functionality to auto-track your accounts. In summary, a lot of fluff, little substance."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Overall experience is good, can track expenses while playing game, very creative and interesting! A lil bit lagging, 4stars cause 1 star for smooth improvement."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like how cute it looks. It's a fun way to keep track of my expenses."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Yhuvk"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a good app overall. The tracking of expenses is simple and the city building is fun. However, i wish there was a way for the app to keep the remaining money in the data for the new month. If you have your bank account or cash in your wallet, you have to add it in again for the next month..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think it's a brilliant way to keep track of my expenses and it's also very fun and easy to use! I look forward to opening the app everyday to see what i can do to upgrade my buildings! Highly recommend!!☺☺"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Love the concept but I am unable to use the app because it keeps crashing on startup. Please fix!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Force logout and can't login Kept using this app for a year, its good. One day it said my ac login is time out, and I can't login ever. Even reinstall can't help. Disappointed I can't retrieve my record. Hope can fix"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really well made. Still at beginning stages, but I have a few of their other apps and all are well-made and thought-out."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Confusing out of focus. Main point is track ur spending but too much things gg on cannot focus I uninstalled"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I cant change the currency, where can change this?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app makes tracking spending fun and I don't forget to record"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled the app before I realized that my plan had not cancelled. I tried to contact them to get my money back. It never succees."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app is REALLY good. There's a heck ton of information, data, graphs and trackers to help you keep your finances healthy. I even subscribed to the paid features so I can find where I can spend less easily and keep paying what I feel worth. The only thing that I'm confused is in the ""game"" aspect. The app is about tracking finances and budget but the gamey aspect incentives spending, so.. yeah."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I doit for the free vip"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Minor bug: Regular expenses on the 31st of every month don't trigger on months with only 30 days (or less, like February). Similarly, regular expenses on the 29th or 30th don't trigger in February. This is different from what monthly subscriptions (e.g., Netflix) in real life actually do. Fun method to gamify my expenses so I have actually tracked them for 3+ years. Lets me categorize my expenses (39 categories max), as well as the payment type (e.g., which credit card), which can be filtered while using the built-in search. Tracks regular expenses but only those every week or every month - I wish it could track more (like every year, every 6 months). After awhile, you need to spend real-world money or watch ads to earn diamonds to unlock some achievements (e.g., specific buildings, vehicles, VIP citizens) or themes. If you don't care about that, using the app without frills is free."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Amazing app 👍 Best 👍👌"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute graphic, financial tips, and user friendly interface. This app makes budgeting easy and fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"a fun way to save"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"looks good but app is not support Arabic language and it is display it reversed and scattered."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very easy to use expense tracker with a cheap subscription plan. Only cosmetics that aren't needed are the in-app purchase, making this a great app to have."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Just started... seems quite interesting compared to other money tracking app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Really love the design and features. But the app keep crashing or take too long or can't open it, and the maintenance of the city becomes a burden for me."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"so cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This super cute game encourages you to keep track of your purchases by rewarding you with new citizens and buildings for your city. The only problem is now I want to spend more money to build my city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Chandan Kumar Chandan Kumar Chandan Kuma"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad. But would be cool if i could indicate a starting base amt instead of adding as income at the start. Unless there's alr such a feature that i missed haha"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome app .. loved the interface kinda attractive even being a grown up it's fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Still catching on but, good game so far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I love the features and specially the game too. however the fourth time that I have used the app it keeps crashing. I opened it for a few secs then it just quit. I have done some troubleshooting steps to see if my device is the one having an issue with it but I guess its the app. I have enough storage, my software version is updated. Restart my device as well. its working once i uninstall the app and reinstall it (second time reinstalling it). But do i need to do that everytime the app crash."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Funny"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"i would give 5 stars if it was a one time off purchasing. I like this idea, it could fight boredom and make keep in touch our daily spending. But it only for cash flow in and out money. I suggest for the improvement like put transfer transaction."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"weird"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The graphic are cute and easy to us"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Quite cute, good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far a fun app to engage you to budget better!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me remember what I spend the most money on and where I can reduce spending. It helps me keep track of finances, manage my receipts and make better spending choices. I love this app so much. The cute little characters make it exciting and fun to record and track your finances. I recommend this to all my friends."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"น่ารักดีค่ะ"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"滑動時城市卡住的情況改善許多"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is super fun. But i'd like this to have option to transfer the money another account that i have. Example ""bank A"" to ""bank B""."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very cute, I wish it could schedule future expenses though"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Been great til yesterday update, I can't open the app as it just crash right away. What I can even do now."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app just started using it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's nice to have a finance tracking app i actually enjoy using. I end up 'gamifying' many things so I feel more desire to do them, and this helps a lot."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Done fixing the crash finally."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"this app is getting crashes every time when trying to open.. please help to solve this"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Edit 2: The app was crashing but it isn't anymore! Back to five stars! This app is fantastic"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great concept, I definitely feel more motivated to track my spending. Unfortunately, I also want to spend money just to see the new buildings.. would be awesome if they rewarded you for not spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"希望增加停止蓋建築物的功能"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun little app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute & fun way to manage your spending. I wish there was a way to log that you specifically tried not to spend money, or a way to track a savings goal. It does essentially reward you for spending money, which de-insentivises saving. Otherwise, an awesome tool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"last update broke the app wont open"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"it would be great if i could evolve the inhabitants"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really fun way to financially plan and record"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's goog and fun to do it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a fun expense tracking app. Since it has game elements you'll keep coming back to track your expenses. It does have the following issues: 1. Watching ads doesn't give you gems sometimes forcing you to watch again to get gems. It's been more than a year and this issue still persists. 2. Using the app for more than 5 minutes tends to overheat the phone and also sucks a lot of battery. 3. No way to merge several buildings together. 4. As buildings increase the app load time also increases."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Nice app. Great interface."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good can play at the same time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a truly wonderful tool! I have developed a habit of tracking thanks to it. I have decided to move on to a more clean and non-entertaining tracking app, but this one is what built me the habit. I'm moving away only because I want more tools and less visuals, now that I have the habit in place thanks to this app. I'll recommend fortune city to more people in the future for sure!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Gaming+Saving. I'm loving this app so far. I'm been using it for a week now, and everything is kinda cute. The ads aren't invasive, and the design of the characters is cute. I just wish there was a way to balance your focus between the gaming part and the finance part, because so far, the gaming part had proven to be too distracting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cuteee"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is super fun! It's really easy to use and I love how much there is to do. I gave it four stars because I can't imagine using it to keep a good record of expenses. That being said it's a very good start!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"客服答非所問，完全解決不到問題"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot. It is really a fun way to keep track of spendings. The only thing I don't like is that a lot of good things cost like 500 emeralds. Oh, and the fact that the builders built me like 5000 parks 😅"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Track your expense in new way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A bit slow on startup but it's a cute app for tracking expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute. It'd be great if you could get buildings for the purchases before the day you started, but it's not a big deal. Also, it'd be nice if the extra stuff wasn't a subscription, but instead only a one time payment."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Since my friends have been nagging me to keep an eye on my budget, I decided to download this app immediately upon finding it through someone's recommendations. I really like it so far; the style and rewards in-game really make me want to keep track of my expenses. Only negative thing might be that I'm inclined to buy something just to get another building—but that's on me and I hope to keep myself in check. One last thing—the salesman is bugged for me; every citizen displays his messages."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've been keeping track of expenses every day with this app. It's fun and keeps my attention!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice game !"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's generally a fun game. Didn't give 5 stars because I felt the need to spend money to justify a record. Some days I just don't spend money but there's no real benefit from it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Amazing Would love if the zooming in and out was fixed a bit, it's quite unreliable/ doesn't function properly at the moment Other than that fantastic!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and fun way to mark your spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very engaging"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Interesting app. Some ads have nothing to do with financial management but with a social agenda such as LGBT propaganda. I would consider purchasing subscription if they had a sort of online financial academy where you can do financial learning."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Slightly confused but getting it. How do I record savings and what does the + and - do when recording?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really cool game to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Really liked this app when I first started using it. I bought a new phone and wanted to continue my progress but I found that there was no way to log out from the app. It wouldn't allow me to use my account on my new phone coz it was associated w my old phone yet there was no option to even log out. Tried uninstalling on my old phone, still nothing. Unless you plan on using the same device forever, I wouldn't recommend this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I am a little disappointed that you have to pay for a subscription to have budgeting features. It seems cute so far and I guess at least it will help me track expenses."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Paid Subscriber: My love is failing. 🤔💔 🤷‍♂️ Using this app frequently for several months, the amount of game assets that require my management are becoming a burden to my phone and time. 🧏‍♂️ The app is taking up phone RAM inefficiently as there is no way to quickly merge or sell the growin huge number of buildings and parks. 🤷‍♂️ I conduct financial bookkeeping biweekly due to my steadily growing amount of work. 💔 So am I being punished for being a productive earner and spender? 👎👎🤙"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A nice little game to track your finances! Lots to keep yourself occupied."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"It was working well until recently where it always crashes when I try to merge my buildings. Decided to reinstall the app but upon doing so, all my data from this month were gone."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love it! Such a cute and simple way to track your spending. Wish you could add new spending ""subcatagories"" directly to the main catagory though. Right now you need to make a whole new catagory just to add a streaming service for example, instead of going to entertainment and adding it there."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"You can't edit the default categories or set budget amounts so the app is incredibly annoying and unhelpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"First, i highly very love this app!, is not perfect yet so I only give 3* cuz i it doesnt have auto transfer beetwen payment type, lets say i want to write deposite money $100 to my bank, it so tedious to write the cash payment type then i write the bank payment type, why it not do automatic calculation? Second, i think dev need make sub category rather than per catagory, lets say i want make food ctegory and have sub ctegory fruit, vagatable and meat That what i suggest to dev to improve,thx"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Wish there was clearer instructions"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Not much to do"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun thing to do while tracking your records. Enjoyable and just fun to see how you are spending your money. I give 4 stars as I would love for the app to actually track my spending and income by linking into my bank account."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Apps is cool! But now I have some issues. My coin not generated on background. It's sad when open the apps but got no coin"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"IAM A PRESIDENT AND KNOW IT ... ***"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great little app and very customizable, really hope they keep coming out with new buildings/themes. I've cut back on my spending esp eating out b/c of this app. I've never subscribed only bought a few dollars worth of gems for the more unique buildings, but their sub is $2.50/month not unreasonable considering they're offering you a pocket-financial consultant AI that gives pretty great advice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"MUNIA"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Perfeito!!! Eu não tenho palavras para descrever o quanto estou gostando do aplicativo! Não conseguia me dar muito bem com os outros aplicativos de finanças, mas estou amando esse aqui. O sistema parecido com um jogo facilita e muito as coisas para mim. Só tenho a agradecer aos criadores. 😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun tracking app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"App Crashes. If you spend money, you will get a building? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? I don't get the concept here. Surely if you spend a lot you can build more. It's not good as it encourages spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Took a little while to get my head around customising the setup to fit my needs, but loving it now it's personalised."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think I should play it fest"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Expense tracking and financial management made cute and fun... Oddly makes me want to spend more to get more buildings..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Me Encanta"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Have to watch ads for so many things like gems and limited time citizens. And still it's not the full version and you have to purchase to unlock basic analytics of your spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"What is this about? I have no idea."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I like the idea but I feel like the app encourages me to spend even more and I find it distracting, there's so much going on at the same time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It tracks spending. I've only been playing with it a few days but it does what it says it does. I do enjoy that it keeps a running total, though. It's helpful for me when I have multiple streams of income, and it can keep track of just the expenses for one."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Just started and honestly did not expect that most of what I needed and heard about the game was under a subscription. I understand it could be an investment in my self but like seriously? May be cute but most of what you want you have to pay for when the point is I only want to pay for what I need."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Poor experience"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really cute idea, more motivated to track my expense now"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is really a great app. I can see the developer had put a great amount of efforts perfecting it. But sadly, it's just not for me. I don't want something else, like a game or something inside my finance app. But thanks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Seems like a great way to gamify expense tracking."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game is very bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"How can I transfer money from a payment (cards) to another (wallet)?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Funny game with can be know how income and expense of each day"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty clever way of gamifying your spending habits. Tracking my spending is helping to make me think twice about impulse purchases and see where I can start saving. Never been so excited to spend what little money I do have. PS, most of it goes to housing and food."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Geart apps use daily and I have been using it more than 3years already! ! Keeping my money organised ! ! Highly recommended ! !"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"完全打不開==之前記的帳都白費了，想轉移到另一個app也沒辦法，爛透了"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It forces lazy people to keep track of their expenses and helps to cut unnecessary expenses in the most loving way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute! But I really wish the categories were more useful and customizable. Where's Savings? That seems super important. What about Gifts, Travel, or Hobbies? Why do Food and Drinks get separate categories?? The app is much better at building your city and looking cute than actually tracking your finances over time in a meaningful way, which is so frustrating because it is ADORABLE."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Been using this apps few years & nice experience so far. But recent 2 months the apps become very lagging, launch long time only can go in. Besides, hard to swipe expenses category page..Please improve this"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute game for helping you manage your spending and remember what you spent your money on"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Lovely, but needs some work to make booting sequence faster"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Why can I only get a new building if I spend money? The whole concept is supposed to be about budgeting. Sure you can get a building through income too but, I'm pretty sure not everyone receives their money every single day. This shouldn't encourage me to spend more of my money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love the layout! App was well-designed, however I could do with a less childish theme. All things considered Fortune City has serious analytical potential!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's nice and cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Learning this so far..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the game feel approach to money management. Well executed and clear."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Seriously??? I just installed the app and it force closes immediately."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great. Fun!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good app Help me to record all my financial transactions"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good game/app I am addicted to it help me to makes me less expenses and help me to remember how much I spend Thank you developers"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Reminds me of when my kid was younger and played Poptropica. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Would have given it more stars if it had more options for the point of the app (which is expense tracking/saving....not JUST a game). It's a decent game. Most people have more then 5 expenses/purchases per day...anything after 5 doesn't count (until WAY later). Maybe after I've advanced to ""Level 20"" then I can see giving it 5stars because then I can use it properly for expenses/savings etc."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is cute, but it makes you want to spend more because it's so cute ... I really like using it nevertheless"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It was a great experience! It brings up the fun in saving so I think it is good for any gender, any age."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fun. But hard to earn virtual coins and diamond, all need to spend money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's been about 4 years since I've started using the app, it's been great to transition from student to employee with this app 😃 I hope to see a desktop version in the future. Then I think it's definitely worth a subscription!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Tawakkalna"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Make recording expense more interesting, little bit slow and bug"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very Interesting so far. Prompt me to put in my spending and have fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I've been using Fortune City for years and think it has such a great interface for tracking your expenses. Unfortunately, the app has gotten laggier and laggier and it's become really difficult to log my expenses. I'm not sure if it's because I have years of expenses (and thus buildings), but I'll probably have to switch finance tracking apps soon since it's becoming almost impossible to check my spending/income because of how slow the app has become."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute it's a gamified financial tracking"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I find it really easy to use the app and also the idea of build a building when spending money or get an income is really amusing! The graphic is also very appealing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Me motiva a registrar mis gastos, me encanta."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute. Only app I've used where I actually want to track my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is really fun to play and it also strongly encourages me to record my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Been great so far! Use wallet along side it because wallet displays all the account values at the same time on the home screen so it's quicker to see, but this is great as a game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It helps me think"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Is a very good app, but one thing I think it can get better is that it really take too long to open the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helpful to make tracking finances daily fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"doesn't make sense Edit: I thought this was a game lol"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"😻😻like it"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute. Not sure if its a game yet."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a week and it's a fun way to track your expenses and income. One thing I will say is that if you don't spend a lot of money, it's hard to add new buildings and citizens. Other than that, I am enjoying this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"its the cutest budget management app ive ever used. And ive used a lot. The gamification is so fun and user friendly. And it make me really want to use it everyday. It has a lot of good features too. One of them is reminding you to log in your expense on a certain time."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Highly Recommended! Very satisfying and relaxing 🤗 Reminds me of the good old days of facebook games where you build city, farm, disco, restaurant, or resorts 😊. Very nostalgic, if you know what i mean 😉. Plus, it makes spending stuff for entertainment, rewarding and less painful 😁👍🏻"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Edit: I'm changing my review. I'm giving a very negative review. They incorporate some of the game missions to get gems/special character by watching ads, e.g., Fundraiser campaigns and salesman. But I couldn watch the ads at all starting this month. I raise this issue with their support team. At first, they said it was the Google ads problem but I can watch ads on different app just fine. Then, they told me it's normal to not have ads at all. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Having fun while tracking"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a great money management app. Really unique and is a great experience to use."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app. Keeps force closing though."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I'm a week in and I'm having a lot of fun. It's changing my attitude towards keeping track of my finances. It would have been nice if when I first began I could have built buildings based on some of my expenses from the beginning of the month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The app hasn't been able to be launched since the last update. Please fix this ASAP, it's a really useful app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty great so far!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"又不能看廣告好幾天了…"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I do love it. Very cute, fun, and useful. However, the app glitches sometimes, and you can't delete or edit default categories. Small gripe is having in app purchases as large as $95 in a budget tracking app (usually people use those apps to save up). Though it's a little funny. Don't get me wrong haha."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good for tracking expenses and entertaining!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting 🤓"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute. Motivates me to track all my expenses and income!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love this app, such a fun way to help me to remember to record my expenses. And it's so nice to look back at what I gave spent. My only complaint is how they still have to incorporate ads, but at least you have to click on them for rewards to watch them. It just seems that if you dont watch the ads when your supposed to the app glitches a tiny bit. But really overall I love this app and will recommend to my friends"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love the app, it's a great way to track expenses. However, I dont really like the idea of the number of employees for each building equal to the lvl of the building itself. This causes me to lose many jobs while trying to max the lvl of my buildings, especially at high lvls (e.g. merging 2 Lvl 7 buildings cause me to lose 6 vacancies). Its discouraging to see so many citizens out of job! Also, I frequently experience the 'salesman is busy' while loading ads with good connection :("
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice, eventhough bit laggy"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app, this is really helpful for me as a student who gets allowance everyday. I am using this since 2019 and I'm thankful for this. I challenge myself to be consistent here tho."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice and cute way to keep track of where your money goes. Only thing I dislike is how they encourage you to spend money every day to keep your streak going."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"You guys do an excellent job!!! 5stars is not enough"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I can't open post office. When I opened it, game crashed."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Goodddddd"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app, makes finance playful. But this one little flaw made me uninstall it... If I change the currency according to my country, it still only lets me note down the sum in Euros, and then converts it to my currency. So I can't actually use my own currency as the standard."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"開app要太耐時間 每日都送太多公園 有強逼症會逼著清下佢 其他都好好 係開app太慢 想記條數都要等好耐"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"感觉还不错的样子 人物挺可爱的"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Edit: They seemed to have fixed the constant crashing and the app now runs much more smoothly than before. Changing to 4 stars because i still dont like how hard it is to find some of the things they make you look for for the free diamonds. Otherwise, great finance app thats interactive and fairly simple."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Don't know why can't load the app recently... I need it to record my expenses... Repeating reinstallation make me feel troublesome....."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track expenses & income."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Peaceful optimizer in a few few weeks but we have had a few friends"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's so fun but you have to be thrifty and not waste so much money! Yay! I can't wait to level up my buildings! 😀😀😀"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Gooooood"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"以遊戲來說開啟速度正常，但以記帳軟體來說開啟速度超慢，這是不合格的，人在外頭要記帳時特別困擾，而且沒有預計支出的設定。"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the layout and idea. It's a great incentive to manage your finance, while having fun! Recommended!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The app clashes every time I click on ""trends"""
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would rly help to have scheduled or recurring payment entries, even if they don't allow buildings to be made from them"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty useful so far, but please add a fortnightly option for regular expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"App continuously crashes on boot since Android 11 update"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Login time is take a bit too long, sorry for my impatient... Otherwise it's pretty neat and cute, but I hope you can get more diamond when you watch the annoyingly long ads."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"they fixed the bug that was making the app be unable to open! I've been using this for years to track my expenses and income. fun little game too"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's definitely interesting. Not sure I grasp the concept but I like it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Please update for Android 11 compatibility!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Only got this app recently and it seems mostly fine so far. My only issue so far is that the regular payments settings as they are in the app now are of no use to me. It only gives you options to set up reminders for daily, weekly or monthly regular payments, and all my regular expenses (including income) are on a fortnightly schedule (i.e. every two weeks). If the app gave us the ability to set up reminders for fortnightly payments, it would instantly be much more useful to me."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Update to my review!! I found a little circle icon in the bottom left corner of the app that you might have to unlock as I just noticed it. This section helps you review purchases to analyze your spending habits and see where you can save money. I love this app! It's like having a personal accountant with a sense of humor! I recommend it to everyone. Don't worry about privacy its just for retailers Info. If you ever had a credit card you have no financial privacy anyway."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app Tracking my spending is so much easier now. And i have fun doing it. The smart suggestions help categorize exactly what the expense was for. I wish i could be able to get more citizens though. The building to citizen ratio doesn't make much sense to me. Are you trying to get me to spend more or save more?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Been using it for one year and a half. Helps me a lot with budgetting. Edit: this app just keeps crashing since the Android 11 update. 12.3 Edit: the most recent update has fixed the issue."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent~😂"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Looks fantastic and fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Recently the app keeps crashing, so I've stopped using it. It might be the latest update that has a bug. Prior to that I enjoyed using fortune city... It's adorable and fun and forces me to physically note down my daily expenses to keep better track of my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. It shows me where most of my money goes and how often. Its easy to use and cute. I just wish it's easier to find visitors to invite. I have to press on each visitor and hope it's the one I want. Would be nice if it's a list so I can see at a glance which one I want for each category. I like how the list is for assigning workers to the shops and wish inviting visitors has a similar format."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Great app but the new update is causing the game to crash. Hope it gets fixed soon."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interactive"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Could provide with a feature to rename citizens and volume adjustment, the game is super loud, if you're wearing headphones, the sound of coins cashing in is deafening. Lowered a bit, because even paying for the subscription, and no ads, when I watch some ads around 50% of the time, I get no gems :("

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Really great idea and wanted to give this app a try, but the app keeps crashing everytime I open it. I have an up to date Pixel 2"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"After updated, I can't use it."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The loading speed is faster now, which I becomes normal because it was slow before. Awesome job! - Why does this keep crashing for me? Would you write a better App?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting financial app!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for awhile to track my expenses and it's been helpful to incentivize me to track my expenses. After getting into the habit of doing so, setting of my own goals in the app (e.g. having the highest level for a particular type of building / levelling up on my town's prosperity level) motivates me to think about how I spend and what I spend on. Useful to get a breakdown of expenses by category too!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm just starting so let's see."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I could not stay log in and could not log in since the last update, pls fix"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"App not opening in Android 10"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Awesome😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super fun to keep track of money that you spend."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app was so very cute and very easy to use.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Kinda hard to zoom in and zoom out."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Now it's more interesting to keep track on your budget. It's a win win."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"美观好玩，让你更喜欢理财"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It encourages me to track my spending but i do want to spend more just to build buildings!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"What can we do with the purple ore generated by recycling the buildings via underground hub? No clear descriptions given"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Maybe add a goal notice, both short and long term to promote savings. Also add a diary of some sort to provide more details regarding the expenses / income. Otherwise a good app to handle your finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a great and cute way to manage finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Have just started, it's cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The App is cute and incredibly original. The App also helps you keep track of your ins and outs pretty well"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helpful app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good for beginner. Too bad many function need subscription to unlock."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app that does what it says!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Unfortunately the app has locked me out and won't let me log in. 2 years worth of finances down the sinks. Always have a back up"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很實用"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Makes tracking expenses fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Pixel 3/Android 11 一開啟就閃退"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm just trying it for the first time I've entered in my expenses and it is day one. I will update this once I have consistently used it for a longer period of time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting app but sadly some functions need to pay"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The saving of money is more on you but if you enter all your purchases and categorize them in a way that's helpful for you, it does make you more aware of where your money is going. It's cool to build the town which is a little incentive to use the app. Not good for impulse shoppers or those that wanna cut down or stop in-app purchases because they do still pop up ""deals"" to buy fake diamonds with the real money you're supposed to be saving."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Pretty fun, wish the subscription was cheaper/there were more features for free"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a wonderfull app so interesting"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun, cute, and useful!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good！"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I haven't played long, but the idea is worthy of my time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just started, its fun but kinda a lot to do so idk how long I'd keep this up"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the app!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"the game is a really good motivator to help me track my spending daily. i love it! will upgrade it soon probably. highly recommend."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've never used an app that's so interactive before! Helps me track my expenses, and build a virtual city (the kind of app I'll be using for long). Really recommended! ♥️"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Makes tracking funds pretty fun. Just takes a long time to get going"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Beautiful 😍 ❤. Very easy to use. Keeps you glued"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not spending is rewarded through public parks. Not the most robust budgeting, but the cute gameplay encourages me to record."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"These mini games can surprisingly make you want to keep record more. The UX is nice; have calculator during input (ex. you can type 10+3) also have the remember frequent uses amount to aid with repetitive records (same spending everyday). Also not Pay to Play. They give you a lot of diamonds to play the game plus ability to gain more via mini games and consent ads. Love it so far."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Incredible, Outstanding, Excellent, Brilliant and all other words... Hats off to the developer. Great app for money management."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute and interesting but aside from remembering to write down expenses I can't see any other purpose or goal it helps work towards?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Should add education and more payment options"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good experience"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and entertaining app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love this game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Tracking my expenses are so funny!,"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very cute and pretty cool. Still exploring this app so not 100% about it yet."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far I really like it. I wish there were more options for scheduling regular expenses instead of just weekly and monthly. I have expenses that come out every two weeks also. Other than that I like it. Its fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Building city make me feel like more motivated to record daily expenses through this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Unable to install on Samsung Galaxy S20. Is it possible to fix it?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"EDIT: app won't open at all. Have uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone and cleared a bunch of stuff. I won't bother re-downloading, which is a shame because I was in a good daily habit. ‐--------------- Fun way to track expenses but definitely not the best if you're trying to seriously manage your finances and keep an eye on what you spend. It's much more of a game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is so cool! Just like the other fourdesire games, a fun and addictive way to stay responsible. You get little buildings when you spend money and the townsfolk give you tips on being fiscally fit."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This has been the only budgeting app able to hold my attention."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its a fun and easy way to make sure I'm logging my expenses. Love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I enjoy using this app for tracking my finance, however, it can be better if the controls are improved. It is not very self explanatory. But I would still reccomend you to use it because it is so much fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute interactive game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"(Edit) There are more advice notifications the more you use this app. I am certainly addicted and consistently pick up where i left off, never discouraged when i continue with days in between - I really like this app's characters and encouragement to write down new expenses daily. I would like to see some continuity with the characters, the citizens especially as their roles are automatically generated, but are not set specifically to any type of character. Their personality quirks are great."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Cant loging via Facebook, Google, email also"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"打開就超卡，建立城市這功能太吃內存，記帳就記帳搞一堆有的沒的"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Edited. After the update? Its working again. Thanks! Before Update: What happened? Everytime I touch frequency? It logs out.. I might unsubscribe if this continues."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me track my finances and actually encouraged me to keep track."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute, fun way to help track expenses. It's similar to a city building game (sim) with time constraints. If you really want to do well with your finances it's a good start to see your spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love the design"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love that app best app to track your all expences i love this app for its cute charecters and for its customize things.thank you its really a very great app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice to manage my credit."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A game that encourages you to spend woah. Neat app, hoping the ability to view subcategory spending comes sometime soon!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting, but the interface of the menu is a little hard to navigate. It also needs a tab for debt, or at least payments to different types of debt. Mostly this app is just a tool to reinforce the habit of tracking your expenses. It's an animated checkbook more than anything. There's a lot of potential here, unfortunately the best of it is probably behind a paywall that I, maybe ironically, can't budget for."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Rani"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"If u start to dedicate urself on this, it would be like a fun game. Its suitable for adults however for students the option is a bit less."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"fun way to play and note my expense"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Interesting app to track expenses. Ironically, you will have to spend money for diamonds if you want to grow faster (500 diamonds for just 1 more builder is a bit excessive). It's also impossible to add friends: they won't receive the verification email upon registration."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a fun way to track your expenses, but it can be really slow (and sometimes buggy) to start which is annoying when I just want to add expense on a go."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to keep track of funds, should add education and also a description to all the spending topics. Problem is when I wake up in the morning, and my bank is full, when I get my daily login award, I lose any extra cash given 😑, and can't spend any old money to get the new"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I never thougjt managing finances could be so fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Adorable & enticing. Doesnt make the habit of daily recording a chore at all! Thanks guys."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The free version does a lot! It makes me go in and imput my spending every day and rewards me with special buildings if I do, and parks if I have 4 or less expenses a day. It had wide categories and then you can make subcategories, too. Very cute, and very easy to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The app is really cool concept but it is super glitchy which makes it hard to use :( I could barely get through the tutorial"

It's a seamless blend of gaming with real world applications.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"為什麼記帳用的app要把數字鍵盤改小……??? 另外市民的屬性長條拿掉也讓遊戲方面的操作變得很不直觀，一下把兩個最大重點都拿掉是不太懂這樣的用意是什麼啦😅"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Not only did fortune city added a horrible text character limit last year, now they made the UI even worse by hiding the bars that show how good the mini-people were at their jobs. Back to excel sheet it is for me, unless those unintuitive changes are undone."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"最近一次的更新把數字鍵盤縮小，問題是這個重點不就是記帳嗎？還是你們其實想轉型手游？？縮小的鍵盤整個增加我眼睛手指對準的時間，最主要的功能這樣隨便的改到底是想幹嘛！！！然後遊戲方面，你竟然把市民的屬性長條拔掉？pm還是決策者的腦子要不要洗一洗？最好有人只單看數字分配他們工作啦幹。記帳方面亂改鍵盤大小，遊戲方面也亂拿掉介面，我到底為什麼要繼續用呢？對，再見。"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting concept of tracking your expenses and income. It is nice and beautiful. The core things work really good.

I tried contacting the developers but they haven't responded to my emails. Hopefully this review will inspire them to get in contact. Update: over a month later and no contact from support I uninstalled and reinstalled (last resort because I didn't want to risk losing data) and that worked and I didn't lose data.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"超讚"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Awesome app! Only thing I'm not a fan of is thr inability to transfer money from one account to the other (e.g withdrawing cash at an atm is currently income for my cash account as well as an expense on my bakk account)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Update: BEFORE YOU UPDATE take a screenshot of your account information and remember your e-mail password!!! I had to reinstall the app after the update, however after I remembered my password & e-mail, we were good to go. This app should be 100 stars! It accurately keeps track of all of my finances, categorizes them in a way that makes tracking expenses fun and gives me options as to what buildings to build & etc. I love this app!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful 👌"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"5 stars for the concept, it's a free app, and it does what it's intended for. Your city will reflect by what you record but don't expect it to be fast. -1 because it is still an ads generator (thankfully it is not forced pop up ads) and for the irony that it is an app that is trying to promote good spending habits but essentially asks for money if you want special features (but still perfectly usable without them)."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Kaev"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I really love Fortune City since it's a cute and fun way of recording expenses. There's the fact that I don't spend sometimes so I don't need to record anything which is something they can improve for users. I think it's really great and they just have to include a function to choose that the user didn't spend that day since I think there must be people out there who buy things for the whole week or don't actually need to spend a lot. Also i think an unmerge function would be interesting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Mainly this is cute. You generate little buildings for every purchase. Everything is entered manually. It does not send consistent reminders and there are other usability bugs."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I have been used this app for three years and was really satisfied. I even just paid $280TWD to support it because I expected I would use it for the next few months. But after this update, I was very disappointed. Not only did I have a hard time logging in the app (while I didn't change my phone and nothing wrong with my phone), I also dislike the removal of record shown for each day. Why did you remove that? Now I cannot see what I recorded and what I did not, for today and any other day."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love he use of this and the way it makes you want to record your expenses to grow a city, a small suggestion maybe in the later future is maybe try to connect our spending card so that the money we spend will instantly go to the app so they can record it themselves"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice as a game, but lacking as a budgeting app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a super cute way of keeping track of what you're spending! It allows you to grow different types of buildings depending on whether you spend money or not, so it really encourages you to keep checking back to see how your town is doing!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good to manage my finances!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Cool concept, but not sure it helps you save any money. You have to enter in receipts on order to create buildings and earn coins, so this game actually encourages you to spend your money, it's a lot of fun, but I think the mechanics would be better if you got buildings when you didn't spend money instead."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is very useful for me. We all spend money everyday and I often dont take note where and on what I spend it. This app makes keeping track of expenditures really fuuun, the art is cute, and the people of the town--- quirky!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm totally obsessed with the city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its inconvenient that my listing window always closes every time I submit a record just so the app can show you that it has created a building per record and shows that it doesn't whenever max is reached. It's frustrating when you already have listed regular expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is super cute. It encourages you to log every day, but it limits the rewards so your not tempted to go out an buy a bunch of stuff. it also rewards you for not spending money. It's great for tracking frequency, but also shows where you spend the most money. It has a little strategy and puzzle element to it too. Really cleaver at making you think strategically about money."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app has what other budget app i have reviewed it has you go though what you spend and help's realize what is a need or want or a self investment or a purchase. It also pur you buget in graphs and allows you to challenge yours self to put a limit on what item you buy the most of this is what i like the most about it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track of finances - I like how it is optional to watch the ads but you get rewarded for them in the game. The characters are very cute, and I like how their genders seem to be quite fluid!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a good app, used this app 2 years, but it gets laggy with much things in the city, (allow to disable the coins effect of buildings or set a limit to the number of objects maybe?). Also, some ads from the salesman are not giving diamond rewards, not sure if this is intended."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"This app has made my phone completely freeze to the point that I have to restart it multiple times, and it isn't a ram issue (I have 3 gigs). No other app I have used does this. Otherwise, I would use it because it seems fun, but just scrolling through the merge options makes my phone malfunction. I hope the devs sort this out. Doesn't seem like something that should be an issue with this type of app. Also, it's ridiculous that you need to log a purchase daily. I don't buy things that often."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for giving motivation to save your money, from the graphic to the user experience, everything is pleasing and lovely"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very enjoyable"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute! Although it seems I have to spend more money just to add more buildings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The latest version is making it harder to earn diamonds in the game. It use to be a nice casual app for expense tracking, not anymore"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The balance wasn't carried down to the next year, which makes it kind of hard for me to keep a positive number which is weird. Sooooo maybe you guys can fix this? I'm a student so I don't have a monthly income, I just use what I have until the end of the year. Maybe you guys can add a setting or category as fixed savings or something so others who really need to save can just transfer the balance into it, then we can see how much we have in total."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love love LOVE this app the only things that could make it better was if it didn't cost so much for the extra features. Perhaps a one off higher price rather than a monthly subscription?? I also wish there was a transfer transaction so you can move funds from obe account to another without sub it as an expense from one account and income into another. Also it kinda makes me wanna spend more to get more actions ans buildings in game so maybe more reward for not spending? Other than that PRIMO"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute game while managing my saving"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love the way it helps me to track my expenses. But every year i have to reset it in order to help my phone easier to run. The more building n citizen, the more it burden my memory"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The app is great, easily 5/5. Unfortunately, I've joined the free trial subscription to see how the other subscriber-only options are and I still do not have access to them, re-directs me back to the subscription page, which loops back to the game because I already am subscribed. Please help! Edit: the developers still haven't replied to the suppory e-mail I've sent them. Therefore I changed my review to 1 star due to lack of customer support."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Still exploring. It's a good way to keep track of things but it's still a free game that you have to tap and click things on a timer."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"可愛"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty solid - I like having an app that tricks me into caring about my finances. I've only started to use the additional financial planning stuff, but so far it seems worth the $3/month I can only assume that someone somewhere is mining my spending data, though, so to throw them off I make it seem like I spend a lot more on porn than I actually do, so they'll be like ""no one can possibly spend that much money on porn"". Then to further throw them off I actually spend that much. It's bulletproof"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice app,detail,useful and fun!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app that aims to gamify expense tracking. Interface is pretty and easy to understand. Unfortunately, customization is limited to make the ""game"" uniform a across players. For instance, you may add new expense categories, but you cannot edit existing ones because most of the level ups are based around them. If you don't mind that, then it's a great app to encourage tracking."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I don't usually make reviews but I'm making an exception for this one. I'm too lazy to track expenses but this app makes it feel fun instead of a chore. I love it and would recommend to anyone wanting to make a positive move to improving their finances!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Funny"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"好玩，缺點如下： 曾有兩次，連續4-5天，睡一覺醒來，早上的金幣量會短缺4-5小時的份量（金流約每小時10K，前一晚幾乎淨空後，隔夜只增加約20K，金幣上限約130K）。 有一次連鑽石都憑空消失了約20顆！！ 後來就沒再出現。 級數5000之後就很容易閃退，幾乎每次打開都會。"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Something different then the usual finance app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Brilliant I can really see what and where I go .... Thanks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app has got a cute and fun concept to help you stay on track with your spending habits. The art style is adorable. And instead of just plain writing how much you've spent/earned you can also participate in tiny mini game-esk things. I'd recommend it if you want to keep an eye on how much you're spending and earning per month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a cute app for tracking your expenses."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Hi I have been using this for almost half a year. It was good for me and fun till a few days ago when all of a sudden the program keeps crashing on me. I have emailed the support team but no one has got back to me. No choice but to uninstall the game now."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A bit tedious"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting way to track your expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"it's ok, but it takes too much resources to upgrade anything// (12032019) app now broken. Won't stay up long enough for me to input everything. Keeps on crashing. What a shame, I used to really like this app// (12042019) Seriously, how can we keep using this when it can't even stay on longer than a few seconds?!

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Before: The app is not only useful but also very fun. You can track your spending, check the diagrams to see what you spend most money on and so on. It's great! The graphics are really nice and there are no bugs. 10/10 would recommend. Now the app keeps crashing at random moments and it's becoming very annoying very fast, before it was enjoyable to write down your expenses and watch the city grow, now it's like a wheel of fortune, will it/won't it crash while putting in a new record."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Fun concept for teens to increase financial knowledge and creating better habits"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good stuff!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I've been using it for 4 days, and am having fun so far! Not convinced yet to pay for the ability to download my spending history to a CSV. Maybe after I've been entertained/persuaded to key in a lot of records I'll feel differently."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very promising app. It's not daunting to use and just encourages you to record your expenses, which is key to starting a budget in the first place. With a bit more personal discipline, I intend to subscribe to this app and be more financially responsible along the way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good so far, seems simple and easy"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It okay"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A app which in a city building game form to encourage usage. cool."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app. I would like it if the builders didnt have a limit. Im very busy on the work days sometimes. So I like the ability to log more, without having to spend more especially if your income is very low. Maybe a sign up program inside the app for New Hires, or new businesses. I do see the premium features has a budget feature, but I dont see it being helpful at this early stage."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like how it's not just a finance tracker, it's a game!"

I figured they'd fix it soon...nope. it crashes about 10 times when i sit down to do my expenses for the week, makes it much more of a chore to balance my accounts. Do not recommend at all."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The first 2 months it worked fine and I loved it because the design is super cute but on the 3rd month it started to frequently close (probably because there are a lot more buildings now) suddenly so I needed to change app. Giving it 2 stars for the good first 2 months & how it doesn't bring your last month's income/loss to the next month"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is exactly the kind of budgeting app I plus the gamification that means I'll actually use it. Honestly it's a pretty good city builder as well as a good budget app. I'm only giving it 4 stars right now because it occasionally crashes."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Really promising. The city sim is an incentive to remember to record spendings. The design and graphics are cute too. Too bad it keeps crashing"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Had this app two semesters ago for college spending. I can't remember why I stopped using it. It's nice."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Great concept that keeps me on top of my spendings, but some lackluster design decisions like how there's a whole separate category for ""drinks"" that's separate from ""food"", but no distinct category for business/work expenses, taxes, education, travel, hobbies etc. Also, buildings start the same size regardless of the amount logged, so there's no visual correlation between the layout of the city vs your actual spending channels, which I feel is a wasted opportunity."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The app concept is good. It is somewhat similar to habitica but still unique. Found that the app crashes a lot. Thus, I do not recommend it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"well done"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Your work is amazing guys. I really love this app. The reason for the four 🌟 is, this app doesn't have Loan or debt tracking feature. If I am wrong please help me where I can that feature in app else please try to implement that feature Happy coding !😆"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Recently the app non stop force close...overall is quite nice to use...pls fix it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot, even though the way it's set up kind of encourages you to spend more money. I get around that by recording single penny ""expenses"" to get the buildings I want, and then recording my actual expenses once all the buildings have been made for the day. I had left a 5 star rating before because it does still encourage me to track my expenses, but in the last week the app has been crashing constantly, sometimes after a few minutes and sometimes almost as soon as I open it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good just crashes a lot"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Really good app, help me to track spendings with fun music & city, but recently my app keep force closed after a few seconds using it, I'm using Nokia 5.1 plus. Thanks, I'm waiting for the update"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"berat"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Normally would give it 4 stars, but for the last few days, it keeps crashing and stopping the moment I start it. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still the same. Might have to switch to another app to track my expenses now."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It looks cute, but I haven't used it for long, because it crashes after literally minutes after I open it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is very good but recently it started to crash. It is getting closed automatically. Please fix the issue"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The app crashed multiple times during these two weeks. Hope the developer is doing sth about it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Nice...but...crashes every time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is very cute and useful in management. However, it is a bit lag in processing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"One of few applications that I give rating.. Useful.. Fun.. It makes us feel rewarded when we manage our income and expense.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"更新後經常閃退"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Crashed. Couple minutes in."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Would be awesome, except for it crashes every 1-2 minutes."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I used to like this apps. But not anymore since I can barely use it because it keeps crashing. Uninstalling......"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This app was sooooo good! After trying other apps unsuccessfully, this was the one that helped me get into the habit of tracking expenses while making it fun and having cute graphics along the way. I shared this app with many of my friends who were finding it difficult to make tracking expenses a habit and they liked it too! With time, as my city became bigger, it got progressively more laggy but I still loved it. Now, it's just unusable - it crashes all the time :( please fix this!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Has been crashing constantly since the new update. Otherwise great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really wonderful! A great and fun way to track your expenses and spending. I just wish the income was slightly more seperate from the spending, like maybe two different receipts? Overall very good :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I find it strange how you can't delete default expense categories? But other wise it's a cute game that'll help you give more incentive to log your spending and saving habits. There's no ads and it runs very smoothly! Edit: game crashes every 5 minutes. If this keeps up I'm uninstalling."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love the game. I would like to have the opportunity to see which businesses are empty. Last version makes the app crash without reason, but its ok."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Would have been a really cool app. Crashes every time I actually start doing stuff on it :/ A shame."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"App is crashing frequently."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"App keeps crashing when trying to use it, lags constantly too"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Liking it so far! You keep track of your expenses while getting motivated with a building game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is an excellent aid for tracking finances. But it is stopping abruptly with in a few seconds after opening it. Please check for the bugs and rectify the problem."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Always crashing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Crashed within less than 5 minutes of downloading the app, when I tried to get into the settings to get a better feel for game mechanics. Any budgeting or finance tracking app that I use needs to be reliable, and crashing so soon is not something I'll tolerate. I'm glad I skipped logging in, and I am uninstalling now."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app but I don't like the agressive attempts to get you to share your city with your friends. Expenses and money matters are generally better kept private."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Income isnt color coded so all i see is yellow that i dont know the difference"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Love the idea, great visuals but 2 stars less as the app keeps shutting down automatically."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping track of your expenses fun! (:"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Cute, but not very self-explanatory. Hard to figure out how to play, even with directions. And I get penalized for *not* making a bunch of purchases??"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Why it does require to read my contacts on Google login?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and eye opening for me financially. Feels very game like though so I often forget it's about my real life spending. Not at all a bad thing. 😂"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Very concerning devs haven't replied to a single bad review. That's not good business ethics at all. Definitely will not trust this app with my sensitive banking info. Also I had to uninstall because it . keeps reverting to gbp when I'm us dollars. Kept closing to my phone desktop (galaxy s8, 1.1g memory available and 18g space available). I can't use an app if it's unreliable with every single press of an icon while in app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I want to like it but it keeps crashing on me every 5 or so minutes."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is so well thought out! I find now that keeping track of finances is a lot more fun and I cant wait for my city to grow. I would just like to see more seperation of accounts from credit, main and savings to track individually. Also room for improvement with the concept of opening balances and carrying forward. Otherwise this app has been super helpful in showing me where my money actually goes and its fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this! Budgeting has been a really heavy chore for me to do and this app motivates me to keep track of my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Such a cute app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Why I can't use it when I changed another phone?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"App is amazingly simple, while others use graphs to represent spending, this game uses buildings. This game is definitely one of the less complicated apps to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute little app that makes keeping track of your spendings more fun. It would be great if it was easier to invite friends that are not connected via sns. Please let us invite using ID instead of name!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would be great if BODMAS can be performed.... Sometimes I have multiple amounts of the same item."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Have not played long yet, I intend to give it an honest go, but I am bothered that there's no way to count existing debt. Entered in the expenses I've made since last payday and my balance looks enormous, but I can't actually spend anything. Very cute though."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"If i go online and open the app it will always stay in the login page. No matter how many times i have login it just froze. Please fix it."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting way to track expenses"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"work in progress - hoping the game format will keep me recording"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I just reinstalled the apps. Everytime, when i launch the apps, it asked me ""Are you ready to reveal the underland's secret?' When i click on the building, the apps closed immediately. It asked me Every time......... Can you fix it?"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The functions and presentation are great. The only problem is that as of yet while it is a great tool for keeping track of expenses, I have not been having much success using it as a budget planning app, though this may change in due time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A fun way to motivate me to track my expenses but it needs to build so many buildings to recruit people 😭😭"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Giving this a try, seems like a fun gamification of finance tracking, although a little confusing so far - familiarity should change that"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"app is too heavy, makes me lazy to even open the app in the first place but overall a really great idea of turning expense tracker into a cute game!! love the visuals, too!! if only the app is lighter i would give it 1000000000 stars"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I just started using this app, but it's so cute and it's essentially a phone app for balancing your check book. I love it! I already recommended it to my bestie! I feel like this should be given to everyone new to finances as a guide for understanding your spending and to everyone who wants a convenient and fun/cute way to track their spending. It has great graphs and month to month comparison charts to help visualize your spending that doesnt show up in your checking statements."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to make budgeting a part of my routine."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is good, the multi-currency display fulfill my need as a international student at a foreign country. If the categories' sections can also have this multi-currency display rather than only display the selected currency would be much better. Also, if this app include the function that can export the expenses data, this is a perfect app for financial management."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app just made expense tracking fun to do. Noting down my expenses no longer feels like a chore, but actually quite the opposite!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good app... Nice way of making financial planning a habit... But the app is simply too heavy for people who have cheaper Android set... Especially the ones who actually need this app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The only thing that stops this app from being perfect is that I can't sync to my bank and the buttons dont always work for imputing transactions. The 0 doesnt even work!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Engaging and motivating. Great app. Update: I had to cancel my subscription because in my excitement to finally start budgeting and using all the premium features, I uninstalled for a fresh start.

Exactly the kind of app I was looking for and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to start budgeting easily."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"This app has become unusable for me. I try to open it and it takes forever to load and makes several phone functions, like switching to another app, take forever as well."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"可爱又棒～"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super cute, lots of categories for expenses, really nice and convenient for tracking. Really makes you want to spend more so you can build the city more...kind of counter productive. Would be nice if there was rewards for saving instead of spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the app, but recently upgraded to Android 10 and now the app can't open. I would love to keep using it once updated, but my subscription just renewed for a month and I can't use the app at all.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"😄"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is a lot easier to use and much less complicated than other paid finance apps. My last finance app was the ever popular YNAB. In Fortune City you only need two screens to really track everything. Graphs are extra Update 9/3/19 Total balance doesnt carry over from the last month so it shows my budget as negative and I cant rely on my balance being true to my bank account unless I want to log the difference as false income for the month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Apps really good.Please consider adding Proper Bengali Language support"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Easy to set start of the month and to add routine purchases. The best expenses tracking so far. If only it allows to share with someone to track expenses together"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"so far so good, will decide subscribing after 1 month trying."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is great when you have mix currency spendings but the negative amount for spending categories do not work. So if you had foot the bill for friends and friends later paid you back, you have to log the reimbursement as an income rather than a deduction in the in initial category."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a game version of using a transaction record book. Finance made more interesting! I'm a personal banker and have actually suggested this to my teen student account holders. Only issue is I feel it should have a good option for the savings side of banking."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Trying to gamify my saving habits. We'll see how it goes."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's way too much fun to keep my finances in order with the app. I just wish you do not neet to record an expense a day so you could get an specific building (I do not always go out to eat)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"One of the most amazing and fun app to manage your expense. It is somehow so addictive that you track your expenses anyway to get the game going. Its an amazing one."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love it! But I hope you can make ways to not only earn diamonds but also chips wherein we can make one more building- I wouldn't mind watching 5 commercials to be able to list one more expense and make one more building 🤗"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"nice and interesting app for recording money ✨"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's counter productive sometimes. It makes me want to spend more so I have things to jot down which in turn will make my city flourish."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for less than a month but it has really been helping me handle my finances better! My only real complaint is that it takes a lot of buildings before a new citizen can be added again"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"can't open the app without it hanging at startup picture"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love the cute little characters that pop up! The idea on this app is brilliant. The style is cute and it helps to track stuff. There is one small thing. and that is that, you only get to put 5 things in at a time. I f you want to put more in, then you have to go and buy it for 500 gems. It's a small feature I kinda don't like, but the games idea and graphics make up for that. Soooooo 9/10 for me! ☆w☆"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app is too good to maintain your minthly income and expense."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is a great way to make tracking your finances fun! I love the personal touches and how it really makes you think about wants vs needs, stuff that will help your personal growth vs. superficial purchases. excited to see how it goes! Although, I do wish citizen number increased as your buildings did...or you could have unlimited. Also, with buildings representing purchases, a person can feel pressured into putting down daily expenses. I wish they could come up with a building or bonus for not spending a day or on limiting unneccessary purchases!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app not only keeps track of my spending but can build a small city while I track my spending. Names of characters are all over place though as in a female chatacter with a male name and vice versa is my only gripe, could also be less ad dependant, but cool way to record spending and build a city at the same time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"awesome app😉"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Why it forces me to login while I've already logged in???"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Nice idea but heavy and I can't even insert a -2.05€ bill"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not what I was expecting, but still enjoyable."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"best"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A finance app, it does what it says. The app allows you to record expenses, income and a bit of others. There is more features but subscription is needed. My favourite thing: you can build a city! Every transaction will become a building and you will make the city bigger and bigger. This is all free! Totally recommend this app to others."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"No fkn way am I paying a 5usd monthly fee for your budget features AND NOW I STILL GET 30 SECOND ADS JUST TO OPEN THE FKN SPP ARE OUT OF YOUR FKN MIND?!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app that makes financial tracking fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great UI and UX. A remarkable 2-in-1 app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"新版更新后没了预算的折线图，有点失望。之前非常喜欢这个与上个月对比的折线图，因为看上去更有控制预算的压力，总有冲动不要让黄色的线超过灰色的线。希望添加回来。"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's cute and beautiful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super cute app for my simple expenses! (Although I tend to feel urges to spend in order for progress to occur in the game.)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I like this app but I would appreciate a function that will allow me to carry over the balance of my income in cash or my accounts from the month before! I would also gladly pay for a subscription, but I think RM12.99 is a bit too high for a monthly subscription. Otherwise, I love the gamified concept"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute and interactive way to manage your spending. Might not be the most sophisticated expense tracker but at least it does help give you an overview of your daily expenses. Not only the app allows you to build a virtual city but it also gives a good analytical overview of your overall spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"lovely and cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Monthly and Weekly trend is gone"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Took me a while to understand the game mechanics but it's useful now. It takes a while to load which isn't helpful when you quickly want to key in an entry. Also, it was annoying at first when it kept defaulting to pounds. There were two settings to change that. Overall, gamification is great so I'm glad to use this app and its generally fun approach."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I think this app is cute, but I would find it more valuable if they could monitor your bank account in a safe way. I understand the point of manually inputting your transactions, but most of my spend is automatic recurring expenses. As cute as the app is, it's not very useful when apps like Mint exist, which track your spending automatically & give you an accurate breakdown by category. Maybe if Mint bought this app out...?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"it actrully makes sense"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very interactive and from way to track your money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for more than basic statistics so it's not really any better than any other app or spreadsheet document at that. As for the gaming part it unfortunately only LOOKS like a city sim game. There's actually no strategy or considerations involved. It's very boring and lacks any kind of goal other than just seeing the same kinds of buildings pop up and merging them. Occasionally you might tap some character and chose which building they should work in."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very good and motivative finacial app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"interesting gamification to record down my expenses! I'm still learning but I would give it a 5 star 1st"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"game to kill time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It was good app, yeet Nice finance tracking if you play it honestly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"While I haven't had it for a while, nor do I have the upgraded version - the graphics are cute, the incentive to record your finances is present and in a manner that's just fun enough to keep on doing it. While 5 records per day doesn't really feel like a lot, it makes me consider what to record a lot more and spend wisely."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"its pretty good to track your spendings, i guess. looks cute."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute way to track expenses but there other expenses that are directly charged to my credit card on monthly basis so I am not sure how to track them without double tracking them with my credit card charge"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice UI! Interesting concept!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The app is too complex to use. I am just interested in recording expenses peacefully and getting basics info like sum total expenditure, graph, charts. Definitely not a gamer person.But if you are die hard fan of gaming then this migyt be the app dor you!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Engaging!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good initial experience"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Adding Fun to FUNincial planning 👍"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"My buildings are stuck at a time warp. its been more than 24 hours and its still stuck on it. eventually it will reset right? i need to know how to fix that issue because i did changed my time on my phone to a one month after, so am i really going to have my buildings stopped until i reach that time of the month?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A really cute app! I wish there was a way to import my old data from another budget tracker to this one. It's gamified money tracking really well, but kind of urges you to spend instead of to save. The new features they've added is amazing!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love it how game and finance combine which makes u want to add more but i would suggest to improve the character, enabling atleast 3 character to add after 1 building because there're many jobs that require workers however because of the insufficient amount of workers they wont let me accept more unless more buildings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The Best app I've ever used!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"super fun game to keep track of my spendings. i have played everyday for almost half a year now. and its the first time i got any idea of how much im actually spending. plus building the city is super fun. i love the cute little details when you upgrade buildings. just wish some of them don't cost so many gems. its impossible to get all of that from missions"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"i tried playing the game, but there were almost no instructions for how to actually play, so i quit"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love this app! I have trouble keeping track on how much I saved, so having this on my phone really helped me! It also helped me realised that I was going over my pocket money sometimes, so now I know when I have to stop buying some stuffs. It's also cute and...I dunno, somehow, it's really nice, being able to help your own city develop with all the adorable citizens!- Although some features require money, it is perfectly fine to use without spending any actual cash!!!- ^^"

I can't properly track my money if I don't understand how to do that in the app. It has many bugs too. The design is really beautiful, and I love the idea behind the app but it wasn't well executed."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I will give it four stars out of five because all seems to be working fine and it is quite a cute little game after all but if you think about it, the objective of it is to spend money. You buy a coffee you get a cute little shop and a cute little figurine to work in it and give you pretend money. So you want to buy things in order to get these shops and characters. This could lead people to overspending and trying to earn more but I don't know perhaps that is just me."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The designs are really cute and the prospect of unlocking new characters/buildings did encourage me to be diligent with my record keeping at first. In general the design of the app is really nice to look at. I've used this for a few months and I like it...alright? Now that I have so many buildings it's kind of laggy (I'm using a Nokia 6.1) and the search and find quests for diamonds is kind of annoying bc of it.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I've just started to use it and it's fun, maybe taking too much of my time, and wanting to spend more to get more buildings, quite the opposite of a budget app.. You could get some extra buildings for saving money maybe? 😊 But as of game play and graphics it's really nice, removed the ads and it's great. Also I think the monthly subscription is overpriced, I'd give it a try if it was two times less.."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a fun way to track spending. I've been earning a lot more parks recently. I do think it's a bit strange that a budget tracking app has in-app purchases for things like diamonds to buy better buildings... seems to defeat the purpose."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Graphic is nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love this concept of gamification of finance tracking. It's really fun and keeps me hooked on it. About the analytics wherein the app shows the breakdown and percentage of where the expenses go, I hope to see the overall - overall income and overall expenses from the start of tracking."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a fun way to create my monetary expendenture into a fun game and witnessing how by recording the budget that was spend on the day enriches and expands the city as propotional to money spent. it made me realize how spending money for investment could make me rich and so does my fictional world in this game."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute but kind of boring. I wish that this app would have an option to create separate wallets. In that way we could track different account books. Money Lover's concept is better, but it is not a game. anyways I love the game design. I cant do much when I am not spending or earning. if only it could import csv. it is alright if it could not export csv due to premium."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game is very cute and being able to log my expenses on the go using my phone definitely makes me feel more willing to do it, because it doesn't feel like so much of a chore anymore. It's also just a lot more fun to log expenses with a cute rabbit person and build a city than in a boring spreadsheet! That being said, the rabbit is a bit over helpful and I've been given the same tip/instruction about 3 times now, which is a bit annoying, but not enough to make me dislike it."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"the game just too boring, and the citizen limited"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I used Fortune City for about one year before quitting last month. The UI and visualisation of expenses are good, and I like the idea of building your own city, but the app has become too slow to use as a expense tracker. Having to wait 45 seconds for the app to load every time I want to record and expense is an absolute turnoff (Huawei Y7 Prime) . My suggestion: focus less on new city themes and improve app performance instead. I'll be back when the app is smoother."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super cute! The only thing I really don't like is how the app continually prompts to share across multiple platforms. You'd think, with finances being something so personal and important, an app that's dedicated to finance wouldn't want to just announce your info like that... I like to use it for personal reasons, and for that reason, I really don't think it needs to be connected to so many things. Other than that, I think it's an adorable little app, and very helpful."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Previously gave a 1 star review due to the unreliability of the app and the fact that it kept crashing.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is very good! However, the unique features of the app (city-building) encourages the users either to log religiously or to spend more to make more logs. I'd like to suggest to enable entries with negative amounts (e.g. interest movements of investment accounts). The workaround at the moment is to create two categories, one for income (for positive interest) and another one under expense accounts (for losses due to interest movement)."

I like that it's turn into a game so you're encouraged to come back everyday and record your transactions. What I don't like is, you'd have to actually spend on things that aren't that important. Like buying more diamonds to upgrade stuff. It also does not have the ability to transfer money from one account to another (at least in the free version). you'd have to manually track it and it's inefficient. overall, i liked it, but it's not as useful as Wallet."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This app is great, I love the cute icons and colourful interface! But overtime some features (or lack of features) reduces my rating. The recurring transactions are not automatically added in. If you forgot to enter the app that day, the option to add that transction will disappear (and you have to key the whole transaction in again which beats the point of auto). It's great that the app gives 5 free parks everytime you enter (if you don't hit the max daily building), but we can only delete it one by one and there's no option to remove this free park feature. This overall starts to slow down the app startup when there's too much buildings A good feature to add in is to total the income and expenses up-till-date. It's a hassle to still have to go thru monthly and add up my savings to figure out my total savings. It's gonna be a problem when there's many many months Overall I like this app but if these features are not improved I'll have to find a better expense tracker app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app for busy people who want to track their spending.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"實用"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"*good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The update is really suck. My currency is set to USD by default even in my setting is IDR"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Don't update until fixed. Latest update screwed up the expenses. My currency is set to PHP in settings but when I add new expenses it appears in dollars. It doesn't feel like my income and expenses tally anymore."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A good app to track your expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"it's super fun and also useful!❤😍"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun game, if you want to call it that. Helps keep tracking my finances in a fun way!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It motivates me to track my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's fun but don't use it to accurately input what i spend because you'll be more focused on building the correct next building. Also doesn't show you what the upgrades do or mean so you guess and figure out doesn't mean what you think it does. But it's fun as a five minute time eater"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like how we can merge them together"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app super cute!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很棒的記帳app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I just start playing this game and it seems amazing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"For some reason the app insists on using my Gmail. Refuses to use Facebook or anything else. Even if I try logging in with another email, and I try verifying my account through that id, it won't give me access. And here's the scary bit: When I did try (in the beginning) to log in with my Gmail, guess what Gmail tells me? That there's a sign-in to my account being done from another computer and whether I'd like to authorise it. Hell no! Devs, this is evil and creepy. Do NOT try to get into people's personal accounts like this. Totally uninstalling until you guys get your act together."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fortune City is a great way to take the boring out if budgeting. The window for a button to register a tap is extremely small and there isn't much functionality for zooming out. It's getting five stars but there's a lot of room for improvement. For starters, the app introduction is incomplete. When I first used the app, I had no idea if the bar graphs in each character page was how much that person liked that field, or the ratio of different fields that the city needs to have before the visitor wants to be a citizen. I still have no idea what the benefit of having VIP Citizens or more taxis is. If there could be a more in depth tutorial, that would be great! The amount of citizens allowed in the city should be MUCH more to accommodate the amount of growth of the city. Also, on a regular basis the game needs to show how many more buildings I need before my population count will go up. Maybe tapping the citizen count will bring up an interface that shows how many more buildings are needed. Moreover, the initial amount of builders available is too little for the amount of transactions I input in a day. Can there please be more space for adding citizens and more initial builders? I love how slowly but surely you can build gem count. It's Chibi style is so pleasing to look at and I'm glad it's a game that's useful in my everyday life. Hopefully, you all will be very successful with your ideas. Thank you for making this app, I greatly appreciate it! Strongly Recommend."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really cute. Just might have a nice incentive to help me track my cash"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting app. Original intention of this app is to train the individual into the habit of financially tracking ones income and expenses, this app interestingly motivates you further by gamifying the process with city builder game to it. To which I find personally very charming. However, developers should be careful that game does not encourage spending for the sake of playing the game, developers should not lose focus on the original intention of the game. That's aside, app is pretty neat."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute app, really got me into tracking my spending. but I think I skipped the tutorial it took me a while to find a few things 🙈"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is great for tracking finances and giving me reminders to keep up with it, plus there's incentive because the little town is a very cute. On the other hand, I feel like I want to spend MORE money in real life just to get more buildings!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"good but slow, phone hot like play game, can't edit and don't have sub categories, smart note but not smart. suitable with children make them have fun with accounting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's okay for now. Maybe add more options where I can write the details about the expenses more specifically."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute App that motivates me already for months to keep tracking my expenses. Points to improve: slows down noticeably the bigger my city gets; randomized names and descriptions could get gendered (a bit weird right now) and regular expenses should be accessible more easily"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very fun and cute. Not just another boring expense tracker and makes me excited to input my spendings every time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Incentivizes tracking your expenses. Just try not to cheat yourself."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great application. I enjoy looking at how I spend my money in everyday and enjoy the game itself"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This seems like a great app but one issue is that unless you change your timeline view to one year then current balance doesn't roll over to the next month (and I assume that this happens for years too) current balance should be calculated based on every entry no matter what month or year they are in, money doesn't suddenly all disappear just because the calendar month changes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is very helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good alternative to write down ur expenses in a fun way"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute! I'm not usually very good at coming back to apps but this one definitely gets me in it at least once a day to input my spending! Ironic though that the budgeting stuff is a monthly fee I can't fit into my budget since I already have a lot of monthly expenses. If it was a one time payment I'd totally buy it to help me with that too!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's the most fun and interactive way to track your spending albeit being unnecessarily fun."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"at app to colorfully and in a fun way, track your expenses! makes it fun and engaging to want to keep up with your spending habits Edit: Its annoying to be reminded your not getting paid on your off week on a biweekly pay period. Consider more intelligent data tracking to only recommend logging in paychecks during actual previous pay periods"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and simple!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's cool and all but it didn't actually track the way its suppose to, unless I'm just stupid. Doesn't let you adjust a balance, or select which account you are spending from it all just comes out of your ""Cash"" account"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a great little expense tracker, lots of fun and cute as a button."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is genius!!! It truly encourages a person to track expenses on a daily basis, which is an invaluable habit to form if you want to stick to a budget. It makes a incredibly mundane task fun and entertaining!

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A simple but entertaining spending tracking app. Doesn't request any banking information, just the amounts of money spent in various categories. The ""quest"" system is neat for something to do while entering in transactions, but isn't overbearing."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Enjoying it so far. Definitely makes you want to keep track of your finances and grow your little city. Really wish there was a savings category! Not sure what to put it under. Also the statistics pie chart they give you starts fresh every month, I really wish the balance would rollover from month to month. If I get paid at the end of the month and make purchases at the beginning of the next month it shows a negative balance which is incorrect."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a pretty good app for visually tracking your finances if you're wanting to learn how to keep track of your income and expenses. I'm not sure I like how interactive it is, like a game, but I will admit that the gaming aspect helps keep me from giving up on it so far. It seems to be a very useful app on the whole, and I do recommend it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good and straightforward"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The city grows when we input our expense, great way to keep tracking!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun but if you didn't spend too much money during the day, it would take more time too expand your city"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great work"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I appreciate the idea of this app to combine finance recording with a game. But for a lot of people the game part is kind of extra. Can we have a simplified mode in the app with our record only?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Setting up re-occurring expense/income items could be easier.  Daily expenses? or the ability to copy/paste expenses so we can just edit the day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great useful and fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A good way to gamify expense tracking. Would like more customisations for categories and maybe some other things to do to make it more fun. However I think it's a good app for people who are lazy to track expenses on traditional money manager app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its fun to manage my expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like it. I just wish they were more specific with the tracking. Like, instead of shopping, do clothes, or something like that. Or make it more lenient and have multiple categories and let the person tracking the money choose which one is best."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"so far I absolutely love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"If can it free then will be perfect"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great concept, easy to use. Btw this app miss one or two categories, what about investment or bank savings?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I actually really like this app to manage my money across multiple accounts. It takes me a while each week to verify my transactions manually, but it really helps me to keep my savings out of the equation and to log expenses on my debit and credit cards together so that I know how much money I really have in the moment in order to maintain my savings. I recommend this to all of my friends!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great game definitely use everyday to track my spending. It's a really cute fun way to do what is usually a chore. I do wish that there was more of a reward for NOT spending money. You get public works but their just for show, you dont earn any in game currency from them. For someone who consistently tries to spend as little as possible, my town makes less money and grows slower to show for it. But apart from that I love the app and find it really fun. Theres a glitch in the moon festival town that I just bought, if I touch the screen to move around the flowers and clouds in the foreground disappear and it's a bit annoying but apart from that I really love the game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I would have enjoyed it better if i could sync it up with my bank info, but that might have defeated the purpose of it I guess. Also there's a lot more ads on there than probably necessary?"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a cute, fun way to track expenses. It's odd in that it doesn't encourage saving and sort of gamifys the actual spending, but if all you need is a record of what you've been blowing your money on (come on, Mint, I KNOW I'm over budget) and can regulate yourself, it's a nice way just to keep tabs on where you're money is going."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app to track expenses with a mini game linked to it. Down side is it surprisingly use quite a bit of ram and heats up phone by a bit. Also crashed a few times while I was using it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"They want your Google contacts. I am pretty sure someone used my info to send phishing emails to my friends impersonating me. I am very upset the game did not protect my data. Great game, but not worth my data being abused."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"freezes and random restarts all the time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's great, I've been logging my sending very consistently since I started using a week or so ago. I like the idea of connecting it to my accounts, but there's no way I'd trust the security without a lot more info on the company. My only real criticism is that it gamifys spending as much as documenting. I do feel slightly more compelled to spend using this so I can level stuff up."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Ok this is super cute! It makes me want to track my spending a bit better. It would be cool if it could link to my current account like Plum does, but maybe that will come."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun little app. Feels like a fiscal tamagotchi with a heavy emphasis on microtransations. Not a real finance planner by any stretch of the imagination, fun and engaging however."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This is an adorable app that motivates you to track every little thing you spend so you can watch your city grow, however if the developers want more involvement and use from users, they seriously need to add *more spending categories *And the ability to set scheduled payments that is more than just weekly and monthly. *as Well as perhaps a More clearer tutorial Most of my scheduled payments are all fortnightly and I can't have that pre-set to save me time so it's a little frustrating. Otherwise it's a pretty good app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"If you're really just trying to make a habit of tracking expenses and income then this is a great app. However it is definitely not the most efficient at tracking expenses. Everything has to be manually entered. It doesn't link to accounts and it doesn't offer help with investing or any of that. I'm also not sure if it's helpful for saving money since you are encouraged to spend money in order to record it and make progress in the game faster. In summery it's great for starting out but if you really want to track your money and grow your savings there are better ones out there."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute app to track your spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute style and I love the music. I like how each character has a quirky background. However, the generation for the gender does not match the appearance of most of the characters, at least when there is a task to get gems. Another downside is the salesman to watch multiple ads to get more gems. I had 55 gems at the start and went up to 78 through the salesman. However, next time or two I logged in, my earned gems were missing and I ended up with only 51! I did not even spend the gems on anything. Anyways, I have fun tracking my expenses on this app. I would just stay away from the salesman and everything will be peachy!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's fine, i like the gamification aspect of it, but could definitely be better. The game heavily encourages spending.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's interesting and quite cute. But I think this app encourages spending as it keeps prompting you to build the city. It won't be easy if I don't spend enough. And there's no widget to allow easier recording of expenses too. No breaking down into accounts too. Not exactly useful for a full-fledged tracking app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Started using not too long ago but tis definitely cute and fun way to keep 
track of my money. Gets me motivated too but just some instructions are not 
clear enough"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Fun app but for full functionality they are forcing the subscription 
method. I'd much prefer a one time full app purchase."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It hangs!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"😀"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just started but it does help you begin to track your expenses by showing 
you a city you're building as a form of progress."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's. Such a cute game that is perfect for a 17 yr old like me to actually 
stay accountable for where my money goes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Bloop"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great budgeting app. My only complaint is that I want to buy more, so I can 
get more cute little citizens for my city. 🙊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad it's a different experience in trying to track costs"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Simple yet fascinating money tracker."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a beginner's app to budgeting in the sense that it helps you track 
down your expenses and income. If you're new to the whole budgeting 
lifestyle, I think just understanding how your expenses divide up is a 
great way to get started. This app is a cute and minimalist-designed ""game"" 
that helps you learn where your money-spending goes. Definitely recommend!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a good app. Would be better if it could link with bank and track 
purchases that way as well"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute app for budgeting your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Haven't had it for too long, but it's definitely a fun and creative way to 
track spending. The ads that are there don't pop up and interrupt game 
play. Instead they give rewards for watching them in exchange for things in 
game, such as diamonds or achievements. Seems a very fair trade. The only 
question about the ad is that it is so fun, that you almost want to spend 
to get the little that compulsive buildings and achievements. Luckily they 
have things that generate even when you don't spend one day to curtail that 
urge."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A savings option would be nice. Deleting a building on entry deletion would 
be a good improvement as well! Overall a very good app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great piece of software. I wish that builder's were more abundant if you 
already bought the subscription, cause atm feels like I need to subscribe 
AND spend money on ""diamonds""."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice App to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Mr."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really cute idea that gets you motivated to key in your finances. 
For someone who finds it tiring to do that- this is super fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting way to manage spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app. I can keep track of daily expenses on the go. It is fun with this 
app. Can enjoy game and do record expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think this game is great because it's pretty neat most of the time but 
sometimes it rewards you for spending money and that is not really the best 
thing to have a app do"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Excellent in monitoring where your salary goes. Adulting life is real"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Beautiful piece. Helpful with the analytics. We just need to remember to 
keep uploading data about the money we spend. The app takes care of the 
rest."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute But difficult to follow. Instructions unclear."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's like Animal Crossing had a baby with my checkbook register."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and cute way to track savings. The little game and animations make it 
more interesting to use to track finances. You have to pay to get some of 
the better analysis options for your finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute! It motivates me to record all my expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I just started using the app and I can already tell its gonna be a good one"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really does encourage one to record one's finances, since it's gamifying 
the process. There are some days where I genuinely don't spend any money at 
all, and that makes working towards a streak kind of difficult. Perhaps app 
developers should take that into account. Adding another category, 
""grooming"", or something along those lines (for haircuts etc.) would be 
nice too."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Functional, and kind of fun too. I expect I'll be using this one for awhile."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting way to keep track of expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The most fun I've had tracking my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute finance application"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I was used to forget recording my deposite, this app really interesting to 
remained my every records."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Undecided so far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Adorable"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Wonderful money tracking app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very fun an entertaining app. I really like the concept except you're 
suppose to manage your finances and I feel like you have to spend more 
money (in real life) to progress"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed to motivate me to keep a closer eye on my finances. 
Since there is enough of an incentive to check in on the app regularly, I 
no longer have to remind myself to track me expenses - it's just automatic."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute! I like it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Usefull apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app! I hope the devs make another game but about 
chores and to-dos. I just wish I earned or spend money more frequently so I 
advance in the game lol 6/5"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"so cute，that is useful app and help me a lot"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So beautiful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute, incentivates to keep record of what you spend"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun game to keep your finance in check"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to keep track of spending. Each item tracked creates a building, 
up to give each day. If you have a day with minimal spending (less than 
five entries) your city gets a nice park. You can view spending habits over 
time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Quite cool for long term usage"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track of spending. Enjoyable and helpful!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A fun way to track spending and save money!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good and fun way for tracking expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad it's a fun was to manage your money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its good to track how much money you spent and build a city as well!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun app. Definitely allows budgeting and tracking expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Lol so cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Now I can finally justify having kept all my receipts since I moved. Fun 
and cute way to make me realize I've been spending way too much on 
groceries!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Reminds me of animal crossing, the gaming aspect can help me to record my 
expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really motivates me to keep track of my expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a wonderful combination of a finance app and a game. Both parts boost 
each other and that's the reason why people can build a habit of tracking 
expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really fun and cute game that makes me actually WANT to track my 
expenses to get more city buildings! Loving it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I used to find tracking expenses really tedious but now I'm all about it! 
Cannot express my excitement with this app! Hopefully I could avail some of 
the paid features soon!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"cool graphics."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute little app to help you keep up with your spending to stay focused on 
your goals."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute graphics very easy to use and useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I hate keeping track of money cannot stand it. This app is super cute and 
it gets me excited for tracking!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I am loving it. I used to pen down my expenses in diary. But I use this app 
now, it is very interesting. It carries all my expenditure and in a very 
interesting way portraits my city. ☺️"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Adorable"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It was fun way to do. But how do you transfer between balance"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like it. Cute simple and helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far, it's interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app, useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So I'm beginning to be on my own, and I love to play games, and I found 
this app and it has saved me so much money letting me know I've spent 
enough and helps me track my income and it helps me be fine more efficient 
in saving money. It's amazing too because as your finace stability grows so 
does your city!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun building a nice city. Great spending tracker that makes me think 
about my individual purchases and spending habits without stressing over 
them. You only watch the number ads that you want and if you spend a 
little, or watch ads over time, you can customize it how you like it. Give 
the app a try and see if it's right for you."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"lag 太嚴重"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Well designed fun app. I found the customizability for creating categories 
was lacking. Also, it rewards you for entering your expenditures each time 
you buy stuff. So the more shopping you do, the more successful your 
city... it seems counterintuitive to reward people for spending more money 
for an app designed to help you save. plus, the free version doesn't have 
budget goals. So the app isn't super helpful with saving unless you spend 
money to buy the full app. I also found it ironic that this money saving 
app charges $2 for purely aesthetic themes... not a good way to save money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Seems pretty good so far. The prices for things that require diamonds seem 
a bit steep though"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this game! Such a fun way of managing your budget!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Seems neat, maybe a little to complicated for daily financing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very useful application, record your finances in a very fun way yeah"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool application for tracking finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It seems pretty good and really cute characters keeps me more interested in 
keeping up my budgeting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really fun and cute way to keep track of your expenses! I appreciate 
the wit of the game and the ease of it, especially for people who are 
nervous to get involved with finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very helpful, useful, and actually fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Hi love the app. I wish you guys could create a version with just the 
recording of expense and income functions. Super simple and intuitive!! The 
city game part causes the app tot make too long to load. At least I really 
digged the fact that I was building a city while recording expenses. But 
now, I just love love the recording expenses part (can't find a better app 
for that)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"App works. Wished there was an account balance review"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it bit is simple and easy and it makes tracking fun 😄😄"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun and it helps me to manage my daily expenses! Great work."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like it, quite cute and useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to keep money on track"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really great app that makes me record all my spendings due to its game 
based design"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty fun and intuitive"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its a fun way to track what you spend but not exactly encouraging you to 
save."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's pretty entertaining"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun app; it'll keep you occupied while realizing you spent too much money 
on booze, food, and shopping"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun app helps keep track of spending whilealso making it fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to record expenses and track your spending habits."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very cute app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute app is fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A simple and friendly app. The game element encourages consistency greatly. 
Great for a normal daily expense recording of all ages"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The best of bests"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far it's great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A different and fun way to keep track of your spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good stuff"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Tracking my spend in a fun way. Might be more focused in the game way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really good idea to make people have a habit of recording, but lack of some 
details, such as transferring from different account and put notes for each 
transactions. Could be better!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Little hard to learn, fun but does make you want to spend more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"~~~ 👍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really great app to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to keep track on your spendings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute! Will have to come back and update this review as I progress 
further into it but I love the idea and the concept! Great incentive to 
keep track of spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its a good idea to gamify personal finance tracking. This is the staple we 
deserve to have in our lives."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Handy and simple. What else do you need."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So much fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really cool way to help track expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way of tracking finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The app is a great idea, but it didn't motivate me at all and I actually 
forgot that it was on my phone. So, it was pretty useless for me. I also 
don't like that there isn't an option to delete the account or remove bank 
information from the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very fun!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"this just wht i been looking for.. Thanks to a friend who recommended me.. 
for month i been searching for the right apps to record my finances.. will 
keep using this apps for a long long time.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"coooool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It help me woth saving"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I just downloaded this game and wroe this review to unlock a new character. 
Maybe I'll edit this after uaing the app a little longer."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's OK"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute financial tracker. Not so much a tool for budgeting, but a good 
motivator for tracking what I spend from day to day. The game aspect makes 
me more willing to keep up with it and to record even the trivial spending 
I might otherwise try to ignore."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Useful and give some motivation for write the note."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Seems legit... Can track all, well... most sorts of expences. It would be 
nice to see an option for savings, and to set repeating expences and 
paychecks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A really fun way to manage your expenses! It encourages you to keep track 
of what and when you spend money - I have recommended it to my friends!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far so decent"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is very intuitive. Very simple to use and very easy to understand. 
If I could change anything I would only wish to know how many levels of 
buildings you can make to reach max, or if you can go infinitely as long as 
you are able to build"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a nice app for financial self-accountability. There's no linking to 
accounts. The plus of that is more mindful entries and no privacy worries. 
It is less automated than non-gamified accounting apps, but I think that's 
part of the draw of the mindfulness part (for me at least). I only wish the 
social aspect was more involved! You can have friends in the app, but you 
only see each other's cities. There doesn't appear to be any way to help 
your friends or otherwise communicate within the app. A community, kind of 
like the labs in Walkr (another Fourdesire app) would be nice. Disclaimer - 
I paid early on not to see ads except for those to earn daily diamonds. I 
forget how common they were offhand without that."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to track your spending and income."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very cute app. Love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"While I liked the concept of the app as a good way to track expenses, only 
expenditures can help increase your city which I feel somehow encourages 
expenditures over savings. The game needs to include saving bonuses as 
well. Also it would be nice to have an investments category as well to 
track monthly investments."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Eh"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Seriously bro? Karaoke in tank seriously?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Lovely game, use this app to tracking my money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's been good so far, nice gameification of a life skill. Could probably 
use some work on dialogue and options but I just started using it so take 
this with a grain of salt"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Lol"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wonderful so far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a fun way to track your expenses, but because it tracks what you 
spend, it kinda encourages you to spend money instead of saving."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This apps surely doesnt motivate us to save money. Since it wants us to 
enter our spending to create more buildings and have more citizens. It's 
cute animation but.. you cant really see how much you've spent overall, or 
ur statistic unless u pay for it monthly probably."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Thank u for making financial management fun. Keeps me coming back."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of my money and control my spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great concept, you will love tracking your expenses !"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a great and fun app that encourages you to keep track of your 
spendings. However, because of its fun, it almost makes you wanna spend 
more. The only things I have against this app is that the finance tracking 
isn't really highlighted as much as the game itself mapping out 
inconvenient when wanting to check for my balance and other things. 
Moreover, it'd be great if we could create budgets here. Hopefully, that'll 
be implemented in a future update. Overall though, great app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the concept"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It'll be perfect to auto locate the new building to the same category for 
easy management"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Currently is good and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Very good application because it will increase the size of k multiplier. 
This application decreases marginal propensity to save and since 
mpw=mps+mpt+mpm, mpw will decrease. Since k=1/mpw, k will be bigger. Now, 
any increase in AD will lead to a more than proportionate increase in real 
national income for everyone! 10*/10*"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good tho I wish I could add some places in it to match what and where I 
spent my money on"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun, interactive way to track your finances in a casual way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is sooo cuuute, makes me wanna spend money every daay"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to keep track of your finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting idea. Gamifying expense tracking. Seems a little light on 
things to do early on."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good way to track spending. Love how you feel rewarded trying to build a 
good habit"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way to gamify your finances!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like it but it is kinda hard to do things but once you get the hang of it 
you will love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"IT'S REALLY FUN TO USE💞💞"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad, keep track of my money using game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"What it has so far is great but i would like to be able to add bank 
balances that also get affected by the records and adding categories such 
as savings so its easier to keep track of what money to put aside. Its 
wonderful so far but it can get better!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The graphics are so cuteee"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a good, cute way to manage and track spendings and I really like it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really like this -- it is cute but practical, makes the serious and 
sometimes overwhelming or frightening topic of finances and spending into 
something approachable"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app to track your daily expenses and gamify it to make sure you log in 
your expenses on a daily basis. What I hope it can offer is for the user to 
create his or her own expense category and not limit it to what the app has 
built in."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful and cute ui"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track my expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"It's very bad at doing anything. Needs a ton of work and I can't see this 
being of much use in any major way, way too fussed about putting out 
adverts and making everything some sort of game to get coins like some odd 
farmville thing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很棒的想法，但是否能真的幫助記帳…有待觀察🤣🤣🤣"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute game for managing expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its an interesting way to track expenses. I think if it has features to

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It was useful for me to track my expenses! The Graphics are nice! The only 
problem is..it cause me over use my money HaHa!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I've tried many apps for budgeting (including writing it in a spreadsheet), 
but now I'm sticking to this one. Smart and funny app to keep a budget. You 
have to put in the data manually, so it also teaches you to be honest to 
yourself with your expenses. ;) The developers keep adding features and are 
open to discussion and new ideas. Recommended!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It provides a fun way to record down my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute app to record your expense and income. cute characters make you want

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just started, seems cool so far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the gameification of tracking my spending. I've used it for a week 
now. I'm not sure if it will encourage me to spend more or track it yet."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"OK for gamifying your spending habits.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great fun way to track expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Advertised as a free budget tracker, the non-game tracking is subscription 
only, and the entire thing limits entries to ~3 per day?! Even at first. 
Illogical setup, deceptive bait+switch advert, no interest at all now... 
Could've been entertaining. 🙄😒"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Easy"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to track expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's so nice that it keeps track just like a checkbook, only including cash

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Too much information, all the game based UX and childish theme makes 
everything so slow and tedious to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I find it does encourage me to track consistently-- how else will I get new 
buildings and citizens? I do wish there was a way to keep track of what 
money is where. For instance, being able to keep track of a debt as well as 
the money you have. The other thing I'd really like to see is the ability 
to select timezones. A record only creates a new building if it was a 
record from THAT day, which encourages consistency. However, if you work 
overnights or sleep inconsistently, tracking before bed could mean after 
midnight-- so either you choose date accuracy or getting the buildings you 
deserve for tracking every day (just variably before or after midnight.)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"very good for tracking but there should be an option to choose beauty 
(hairdresser etc) as category option"

term because of the issues with loading all the buildings. It also does not 
respond well to touch and frequently crashes. I've only used this app for a 
few months and log about 3 days a week. It was good for building habits but 
its time I move on to a more reliable app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really great little app that ill actually stick with for a while. One 
downside: it makes you want to spend money so you can get more cute houses. 
I do find that id likea house type for savings accounts and not just track 
in and out of the one account. Personally i never use cash, this affects 
how i experience the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great and fun way to keep records of your expenditures. Is there any way to

it's always a chore. Now it's fun to track. One qualm I have is the lack of 
category options. Other than that though it's great :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Weirdly enjoyable."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Overall, it's fine. The characters/citizens are ones that is most likely to 
frustrates me because their gender and their look were totally mixed up and 
their stories is a bit boring and not sync with their talents. Also the 
mayors aren't as appealing. And the way to level up the max coins to be 
collected is too constant and very low. This somehow shows that the 
developers seems to have a lack of caring on the small details. But the 
functionality of this game did it's job."

bonus of the super cute graphics and the short snippets of the citizens 
lives, I really like it a lot more than I thought I would!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It lets me log my expenses in a more engaging and fun way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I want to like this app. The tutorial doesn't clarify that you can edit 
categories and accounts. There is no place to put your starting balance so 
that it's not counted as an income or expense, throwing off the data. That 
said, it is very cute, and there are more aspects to the game than logging 
expenses. However, the issue of no starting balance ended up wasting a lot 
of my time, which is the last thing I want from a finance app. The point is 
to make it easier, not more difficult."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Another lovely little helper app from fourdesire. Beautiful art, ethical ad 
implementation (very short ads, very optional) & an easy city builder that 
still has progress on days when you have no expenses. Loses a star 
currently because the app sometimes throws up a ""pirated"" warning after 
random phone/log out crashes that forces a reinstall. An ""it's safe"" option 
would be handy! Gender doesn't always match names/viduals of characters, 
but that doesn't bother me :)"

is a million times better"

improvement before i want to buy the pro. Example: is better if we can 
create more expense categories"

tracking apps) but pls pls pls pls, I'm begging you, please add a very 
special feature that also tracks your savings because I really really want 
to save in a kewl kewl way and consistent!!!!!! (I'm tracking my finances 
more consistent now!!!!!!!) Pleaaaaaaassseeeeeeeee"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app that makes boring stuff fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So funny"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love it! A fun way to track expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Addictive!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'd like to be able to add my own categories. But in particular I'd like to 
have one for ""social"" activities. Not being able to make my own categories 
makes this more like a game and less like a truly functional app for book 
keeping. I'd prefer if it was both."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Not smooth in my phone. Please fix this. You have a good concept"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"You can save your expense in this fancy notes. And play the game to build 
your city in different ways"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It has super nice features and user friendly. The worst thing is that it 
opens slowly and that forces me to change to use another app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app.. It was only difficult to find where to view how much is left on 
each account separately (cash, card, etc.), and no way to move funds 
between accounts, it this could be possible, then I'd give 5 stars!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Das ist wunderbar"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Not very interested in it at first, but the monthly report 
is really cute! One sad thing is that now I know how much money I spend and 
I feel guilty very often"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful, and their user support is also very good! :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"runs smoothly, great time killer, and really adorable characters XD"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Suppper cute and fun! Motivates me to take care of my money and a budget."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Can be improved, but overall it is good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The only downfall is I just started and now wanna spend money to get more 
buildings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a lot of fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy way to manage finance"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很棒很可愛的軟體"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app, needs a paid version without ads though"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track my payments! I love how it gamifies and incentifies that 
gruelling task of having to input payments, and the SmartCategories make it 
that much easier to tag and categorize without having to think about it. 
Love it!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"overall it's really good and useful. the interface is a bit confusing, and 
need some time to learn about the app, what can i do with it and such. but 
still, for someone who spends impulsively and can't really take notes, this 
app works"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun to play!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app, but amount of expenses allowed a day should not be limited."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Add other categories like ""Education"" and ""Banking"""
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like it! It's pretty hard to change the currencies though since you have 
to change it at the setting. It's great for travel since it computes your 
expenses for you. Just that if you used a different currency, you have to 
delete your original entry"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think its a rather creative way to keep track of spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Wow! Very interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute idea, really love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I wanted the stupid star to go away"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good application to track our spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting app but it would be better if we could get more diamonds or 
have more builders."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute and motivates me to encode my expenses and incomes so that I can 
track my habits."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its cute and really helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A++ love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very useful and interesting money management app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really love this app, tracking your spending in a fun cool way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great fun while recording spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute and useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I keep getting an error after updating the app. Can developer get back to 
me? I can't access it at all."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really useful and fun app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Simple but customizable to help you track spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice design app to mix game and finance record"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"goog"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is so interesting to keep track of expenses but it takes time to open 
the app every time recently. It will be better if it is faster."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Weirdly addictive. I've tried to track different expenses and habits using 
other types of apps before. But the way this game combines a timed coin 
generator and rewards for tracking any sort of financial descision is 
awesome. Had to figure out a couple of easier tricks since there isn't much 
of a tutorial but that was also part of the fun. Have already recommended 
this to fellow friends and colleagues."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"GREAT APP"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The graphics is cute, plus easy to use interface."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty good!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think this app will help a lot of people save their money even more and 
record every amount of their money had used"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its great, makes me want to track my spending everyday"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and easy way to keep track of spending! Very engaging"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"At first, I thought I won't be playing this app for more than 3 days, but 
now it's been months. It is really useful for tracking my income and 
outcome as well as categorizing, at the same time, it's also fun as I 
become the mayor of my own city and meet new characters. The only thing I 
don't like, is that the salesman now, needs increasing amount of help with 
so little pay in return."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Track spending and fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice apps Nice Apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Look. Here's the thing. People go for apps like this to budget their 
expenses. It's great that you can record what you buy and all, but the 
features of this game makes it so that it's rewarding you for spending more 
and more. Cute, but not good for budgeting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super excited for a game to improve my money skills!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Fun and cute, just wish we didn't have to pay for more builders. You can't 
track your expenses properly with this app unless you spend money on more 
features."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app is a cute abd functional tool for teenagers or adults alike to keep 
track of their spendings in a fun way!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way of tracking expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"A good way to make keeping track of spending entertaining. App can be 
smoother, town view could be slightly further away for more field of view, 
merging structures could be simpler. Uses a lot more data than i like it to."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm honestly not sure what to make of this app yet. Update to come."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty solid way to keep track of my finances. Love that the statistics can 
be broken down per day to see how I spend on a day-to-day basis."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun app to track expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Just downloaded this app so not sure yet so I'll give 3 stars for now"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Likey"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Loved it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its more fun And i cannot wait to open it To collect gem .. And set a time 
so that i know when to open it to work again the characters"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far this app is really good especially because I suck at saving money 
and keeping track of my finances lol but so far so good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I luv this its so cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm just starting out but I love being able to track real life stuff 
through a game system"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's was okay. I enjoyed using this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It makes me feel so entertaining recording my expense. The 
detail in each citizen is charming."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"One of the better gamified experiences I've seen in a while."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's has a really nice interface"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome concept and execution to match. It has passcode lock and doesn't 
require you to sign in. The main downside for me is that it is laggy for my 
phone"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like it. Simple and fun to use．I actually look forward to entering 
expenses．I hope that the creators will add more categories for 
expenses，such as a separate category for gasoline."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really neat little app, really helping me to curtail spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Great App. However it takes a while to load up which is sometimes annoying 
when I just want to record an expense on the go."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Simple... reflects our spending habbits"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Addictive in a way that you will want to record you expenses everytime."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very fun and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good to monitoring self expenses ."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It really does make fun to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"...not bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Absolutely love IT!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"This app collected all of my information from my Google account and I mean 
everything I'm reporting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很喜歡"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun app. But, it would be good if it has daily category conclusion"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good graphics but it's not a game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It helps in tracking my monthly expenses in a very interesting and fun way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty confusing at first, but it's a pretty fun way to record finances. 
Somehow makes me want to spend more money irl tho lmao"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Well-made graphics with no obtrusive ads so far. Glad to find a budget 
tracker that doesn't need access to your banking info. Some categorization 
is difficult based on the selection of tags available."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Such a cute way to keep track of spending and identifying where you spend 
the most money!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far this app is fun and really well designed! Still getting used to how 
it works but overall love it so far!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Looks cute so far. We'll see how long I stay hooked."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's nice but more advanced options would be nice. Like loans and other 
accounts for savings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A great way to gamify expense tracking. It makes me a little more diligent 
about the whole process."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to track spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep track of your income and expenses, city evolves lovely 
too."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"The problem is that you only collect coins when you have the game open, 
once you get through the initial set up theres nothing to do but wait. Am I 
really supposed to just leave the app open in my phone to collect coins to 
help build my town? The best thing to do while you wait is to watch their 
ads and find the little hidden items for a gem or two. Money is a lot more 
fun than that."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Gets a person in the habit of expense review"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Overall this is a nice app, it would be great if you could add some of the 
more advance stuff like budget, saving, loan and even greater if it could 
connect to the bank Keep up the good work 😊😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"😎😎😎"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use and fun. Only thing is it makes you want to spend rather 
than save."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hard to see daily reports"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's not got a whole ton of festures, but it's exactly what I was looking 
for: a simple and interesting way to watch my spending habits."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really fun and motivating at first but as it gets harder to build up your 
city and find places for your citizens to work it's hard to stay motivated 
to continue. Nonetheless, it's still probably the only way that could have 
motivated me to ever track my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Maybe you can add a archive for saving or target saving for a month or year"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Kinda fun keeping track on expenses ..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"More settings would be great. Adding your own categories also"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its a simple and fun budget tracker. Graphicly its awsome. I want to use 
this app to teach my children how to budget, but some ads have sexual 
content that are not appropriate for children~ its a real shame. It would 
also be great if this app can set buget reminders. (eg. It would reminde me 
that i spend 50%, 80%, 90% 100% of my allowence per month). It"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is absolutely great and fun way to keep a track my daily expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's really cute"

not for more complete expense tracker or payment reminder."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app"

for me."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Start budgetting 😃"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Gem is too hard to earn"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great fun way for me to keep a track what i earn and spend"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great !"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app, really cute. Useful to keep track of general expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the concept so far."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's really cute! And it helps you keep track which great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"funny"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"great animation"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's awesome!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's great that I don't have to list everything down on paoer and do the 
math manually. THIS HELPS ME TREMENDOUSLY TO STAY ON TOP OF MY FINANCES. I 
love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"he'll yes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The cat alone is worth it."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great..make me more discipline for record my daily expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app helps me become a smart adult by tracking my everyday expenses. It

this app.. it is kinda deceiving to be honest. But, dont let that hinder 
you from tracking your everyday expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep track of your money and can play game at same time! Very

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute! Really motivates me to keep track of my spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"My over all experience with this app as a college student, it really helps 
me manage my weekly allowances and also help me notice what I where I 
mostly spend my money on. I also love the idea of this app being 
interactive with its users unlike other apps."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is so far the best financial app I have! I've been using this app for 
months and I always want to note everything I buy. But it's so hard to 
collect gems. It takes lots of time and everything is quite expensive 
(theme is 300 and builders are 500). Maybe lower the price?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute and a fun way to record expenses and incomes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's been only a few minutes I've installed this app and I'm hooked already."

convenient."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun app. Recommend"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"总体来说还不错，但是需要的权限有点多"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Adorable and interesting way to do finance recording"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun Apps to track daily expenses. Made me realize how much unnecessary 
spending i've made in a month. I wish there's more than 5 builders per day, 
have to mine the diamonds to buy more builders."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a really fun way to track your expenses :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track of my spending, so far no complaints about the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A great app with lots of nice features for tracking, however I think it 
needs a feel quality of life improvements: 1. Easier conversion and 
tracking for multiple currencies for international people 2. Ability to log 
a nil expense for those who have logged in but didn't spend anything - this 
encourages constant logging but not for us to spend everyday 3. Customer 
categories for when we have large miscellaneous expenses like groceries 
Otherwise great app and thanks for all the work!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a great app! However, I would really appreciate a function to add 
custom categories, and better currency conversion."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way of tracking expenses, the cute graphics makes me motivated to 
record it down."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Makes recording fun, motivates me to do so; not a chore anymore :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a fun little app that helps you track spending. I also enjoy the fact 
that you can spend money on the special currency, but you can also gain 
said currency slowly but in fun ways! Definitely the right way to do a 
special currency! I also feel like you gain coins at a great rate that 
let's you do things throughout the day. Highly recommended!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's super cute and helpful for managing and being aware of spending. It 
doesn't have a budget feature but I use it to track my budget anyway by 
including how much money I have left in any category in the description of 
each entry."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app but it would be so much better if we could record donations in our 
spending too! Please add a donations category ~"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track your savings and spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app makes me want to update my expenses often. However, in another 
angle, the app encourages people to spend and spend to increase the size of 
their city. So, my suggestion is for the app to have a budgeting feature so 
people are spending within the their desired limits. :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's hella cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if I could sell multiple plots at once (especially parks). It 
caters to the mindset that people will make a couple purchases everyday... 
Not so good for people who purchase less frequently (ie buy in bulk a 
couple times a month)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A fun game to record expenses in the same time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute! I feel much more motivated to track my money habits. I think my only issue is that there's no way to input a $0 amount. I don't buy things every single day and I only get paid every two weeks so there's nothing to input on some days. I've just been putting in $0.01 on those days as either income or misc just to keep my streak, but sometimes I forget (because I haven't bought anything, obviously) and it breaks my streak :( Otherwise, I love this app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Unique"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love this!:)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Excellent but can still be better"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its a good way to keep track of your spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute game that positively incentivizes you to track your expenses and income!   This is cool for someone getting more serious about money management, but who enjoys a little cuteness in their life."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Funnest most addictive way to track spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful, cute and addicting!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very useful and  interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting so far."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Everything is Great. I would like to tell the developers that in this app, 
people with male appearances have descriptions as ""She"" and vice versa. 
Please fix it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's good so far. Wish there was a way to add a few more categories though. Like Savings or wages for househelo and the like. :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Saved me so much money!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is a cute app. It's fun and help you track your spending. I love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a cute idea, but you have to manually put in records of how much you spend which is a bit old fashioned and then it only counts if you put in records for the day, so in a way it makes you want to spend more. There should be rewards for saving money and not spending anything for the day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I havnt used it much yet, but the design is cool and different. The game is 
an interesting way to get you more involved with your money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun concept. So far very well done."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Sheet. Not really useful as a financial app. But fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app. Really helps in keeping my spending habits straight."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is so cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute features it attracts me to do daily updating of my expenses and 
income"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"While it may not have bank linking or investing functionality, i've never 
been more motivated to track my expenses. It's also easy to use and very 
pleasing to the eyes Reminds me of my old favorite: tiny tower hehe"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like the city building idea as a form of motivation for keeping track of 
your finances. The stats are nice and clear as well. I do wish there was a 
way to connect your bank account or at least provide some kind of ""my 
available fund"" to easily compare how much I'm spending relative to how 
much I have saved. It's also a little disappointing that when starting out, 
filling out past expenses do not earn you buildings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app so much! 😁💗📱It makes managing my spending super fun! The more you spend, the more it flourishes. But even when you don't, you earn parks instead which can also be merged into something bigger! The new update is nicely laid out too - makes reading the ingame notifications easier! Wish we could interact with friends rather then just visiting and looking at global and local rankings..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really cute app.  I had to sign in to an account at one point and ever since then the app had been lagging all the time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"More layers and buildings shown now, dragging to the sides could trigger the the rendering of buildings, needs a bit of good care of it, Keep it up!"

Maybe a ""hobby"" option or even just making personal categories create the same buildings as miscellaneous. It would be so helpful!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I didn't like recording at all, but this interesting and useful app makes me so happy to track down my spending. But it's pity that we can only create five buildings in a day. Plus, savings function is also in urgent need. Thanks for your efforts!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The only expense tracker I've been able to stick with over the long term because the gamification is such a great incentive! I love watching my city grow and organizing it! It's cute how all the citizens have such diverse appearances and personalities and the art style is very appealing. I like the sound effects and music too. It's fun to work your way up to bigger and fancier buildings! As others have mentioned my one suggestion would be to add a reward for days when you can check off that you didn't spend anything. This would be good for the game too since it would encourage users to check in daily."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this app! Aside from tracking your spending. The game theme of this app is enjoyable."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This app makes me want to purchase rather than save honestly. The way that you have a huge number of characters on screen but can't even populate your buildings unless you record 8-9 purchases/income a day seriously would just make users want to spend all their money rather than save it because its easier. Not really ethical design. If there was greater reward for money SAVED rather than SPENT, this app would get 5 stars. Also i'd really like to have a population cap more than 6 if i already have 10 jobs unfulfilled"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great little app. The city building certainly motivates you to keep logging."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting app that helps a lot"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"it's been really useful for me 'cause it makes me have to remember to log my expenses in order to build more buildings. sometimes i feel like it might make you wanna spend more though, since you don't get any buildings if you don't spend... maybe that's what the greenery/fountain/etc buildings are for, but yeah.  recently the new feature of daily login rewards was a nice and fresh addition. however being a student that stays home on the weekend, my ""streak"" tends to break because i don't open the app; but i don't have any reason to open it because i don't spend money on the weekend. i get that it is a way to motivate you to open the app daily so you can log your expenses habitually, but it gets annoying especially when i'm on the last day but fail to get the stonehenge since the thing resets just because i didn't open the app for a day. maybe instead of making it a breakable streak just make it cumulative?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track of spending."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A suggestion that think is that you can add a feature that you can earned to reach a goal like car, tv etc."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track spending and build good habits"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really addictive and fun way to record your spending. My advice would be to add some indicators about building that don't have a worker and make finding a very high skill citizens more easier. Also a feature to trade or interact with your friends would be a welcome addition."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Awesome idea and design. Being 17 it was great to get me started on managing my money better. Plus having the ""game"" element kept me coming back. Would recommend!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Okay here's the thing, I loved this app sooooo much, but now it keeps showing me the login screen and I keep loging in and it still stays. Even after making a new account and redownload information it it kept doing it. So one star it is until it's FIXED."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Gamification concept is great! I love the way that you record expenses and playing games at the same time. I wish there's an option to import or export data so that we can move from other apps to this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Can make me have habit to record my expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think if you don't have this app, boi you should hahahaha xD"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app! Although I've lost my recent activities because I tried to link up this app to facebook, which I've done a long time ago and now the app was replaced by the old data. Very disappointing."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun and innovative way to record your expenses and financial, what a great app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome app that makes budgeting fun through gamification! It definitely gives me incentive to track my spending every day. However, I wish the app had a reward mechanism for when you don't spend money, which would develop your saving habits. I can see how that's difficult to differentiate from forgetting to record your spending, but maybe if you could simply check a box to confirm you didn't spend that day and get a reward for it. I'm happy with everything else about the app though! Great visualizations and awesome game design overall."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So Fun and easy to use. I absolutely love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Excellent!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Love the concept and art, but wished there would be more categories and that the daily limit could somehow be shifted. What if I spend a lot on a certain day and not after?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is probably the cutest finance app ever ! It keeps you motivated to record your expenses and savings. One thing i would suggest is to enchanced the challenge, other than medals, maybe we can add weekly or daily challenge, so we can stay motivated ? Thanks, btw"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I would love budgeting and goal setting in it. Still it's a really cute and great app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a good app that helps you build the habit of tracking your daily spendings.  I encountered a glitch though. I enter an entry for learning but the building built is for entertainment. Please fix this bug"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"hello"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a nice app to keep track of your spendings. But it kinda urges you to spend more rather than save up."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"i like it, It let me know where my money going though game systems"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would have been nice to add custom categories instead of adjusting to the existing ones. Would also have been good to have categories for savings and investments. But a good app nonetheless."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I would love if have more categories to choose, e.g. travel"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm more motivated to track my expenses than normal money apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Been using the app for a few months. Overall its not a bad app. Its fun and quirky, and cool (or bad) to see your city grow the more you insert spendings or income. Only downside is that if you didn't spend anything that day you lose your streak. Would be great to have an option that you click saying you didnt spend anything. Also would be nice to have an option to write a note in what you actually spent money on instead of just ""food"". I also dislike how learning and entertainment categories are under the same type of building..i was hoping to make schools too..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice way to gamify recording expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I want to delete my account, but there's no way to do it in he app and you don't reply to emails. So how do I go about doing just that?"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Useful fun app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I agree with other users there needs to be a way to record days without any expenses or some kind of reward system for parks/green spaces."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and helpful. You'll definitely want to keep track of your finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Useful!  I find this very relaxing, addicting, and useful at the same time. The grapic is soo cutee... I always looking forward to see how my buildings will become if i keep merging the same type of buildngs. Totally Love it!   This app will become more great if we can see the details of our spending, not just a static showing on screen. The rest is aweasome.    Keep it up!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Makes recording expenses something to look forward to. Less 1 star because I wish there was a way to export data."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"App does things as advertised but much better with a nifty game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very motivating app. I have never record my spending account for so long, but the interactive features in this app drives me to consistently take note of my spendings. However, I would suggest to add a category for savings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Incredibly fun, everything I love about town simulators, but with a real life drawback to keep me from going crazy. I've tried multiple expense trackers and this one is the most fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Working out well after 1 month of use!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this little innovative money tracker app 😍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A really nice app through and through, would have enjoyed the possibility of adding sub-categories (snacks and food separately instead of all together with the same housing) and the possibility of setting up a category that manifested in the city as slums, for something one would like to spend less money on, f.e. smoking or diabetes (sweets) or heart-disease and cancer (meat)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun app to keep track of expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app displays all of your spending and income in such an easy to view and fun way. It makes keeping track of your spending as simple as possible and it full of features which are very useful when comparing days and months of data. Overall a great app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is motivating me in keeping records of my expenses on top of the mini in-games. I'm giving a 4 stars as it doesn't rewards no-expenses day, which is a also a goal."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"App is good and helps me to maintain records of my spending, but it's not clear how to add my income, and it only allows you to add five expenses a day on the free version."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun little finance tracking app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I recommend to input your income first before all the expenses. Cute concept and fun. Seems like I made achievements with tracking my financial activities."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It is not my habit to record my expenses regularly but because of this fun app, I now make it a habit to do so. I think it would encourage users to spend more just to grow their city though. 😂😂 It might not help for the impulsive buyer. But it is a good app to track expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and addictive! This app provides another look at bugeting. It lets you track your spendings and puts it in a timely graph. One thing though you have to open the app just to add an entry. I hope they develop a shortcut button at the homescreen. Overall, this is the best app so far!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game is fun and helps me manage my daily spendongs in a fun and profuctive way."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun, but not good for managing funds at all hahah. The game literally relies on you to spend money to proceed. So if youre saving... you get no game hahaha."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is a peaceful game, can be made more exciting!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's good, just need a saving/investment category. And categories should be totally editable."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"very addicting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I LIKE  IT"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like it so far. I hope it helps with tracking my spending.   I wish it was more customizable though. I would like to be able add my own categories so that I can track specific items, like credit bills, how much fast food I eat,  etc.   Also, I would like to be able to set the frequency of the scheduler myself, but be bound to weekly or monthly. I have biweekly and bimonthly payments I make and I would like to use the scheduler for that."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great so far and love the concept. Because of this app,  I started tracking my spending.  If only you guys can improve the graphic. Will be more awesome.👍👍"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good for tracking spendings. Add more categories for further organizating"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fantastic way to gamify finance tracking, with great incentives for frequent and full logging of finances. The use of building types to show frequently-used categories makes it intuitive to follow where you're frequently spending, even if you don't use the analytics (and I recommend you do)! Has revolutionised my spending habits after less than a couple of weeks!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice funny app to manage personal budget."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track my money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like the app. Keeps tracking expenses interesting :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and cheeky way to encourage game play but also to keep your spending in check"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helped me to track my expenses in a non boring way and with more fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Im so happy the bug is worked around, i have a suggestion, please add the ability to add category but it must be under the main category such as the income, food etc.   Another thing, please also add savings category. Please i need it badly, im having a bad time with income vs my savings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Quiet good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Most of finance app are boring but when you integrate it in a game it will make it a habit to open it even without buying anything"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Doesn't really help with financial habits. It's just rewards you for entering the money you spent and punishes you if you did not spend money in a day.  Does nothing to help with a budget, if anything it encourages you to spend more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's really fun and addicting. I wish there was a way to keep track of days when you don't make any purchases without losing your streak, though - honestly, I felt pressured to buy something just to avoid breaking streaks, which... from a financial wellness app... :P"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I almost want to spend more money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The concept is great but there I no option for setting up recurring payments that are automatically taken out of accounts on  a regular basis"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's quiet a good game XD"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend! Such a fun app for anyone looking to monitor their spending. It falls short in regard to bringing over your remaining balance from the previous months.. But that's not the aim of this app. The aim (and strength) is to make recording of spending entertaining and fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful for tracking your spending!! It's made me so much more aware of my finances. Highly recommend :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice  game  good for children"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Really like it but after a while i got lazy to open the app because on many days, i dont have anything to input. Lost my streaks so many time. Really laggy as there are so many parks."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way to track spending and actually just a great functioning game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"R u sure this really tracks expenses? I cant even add more than 5 spent money. I need to buy builder really? Uninstalling. Nice effort though"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Gamifying tracking expenses. Lots of features for actually tracking expenses still missing, but it's fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great game"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its good enough"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I'm giving three stars, even though I'm not starting in using it, because this app will be very helpful for me, I think. Suggestion: Add a widget to the home screen. ( most especially for a adding a new record. ) this will serve as a more convenient way to record in a 1 click. Hope ya like it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm actually using this app so well! I definitely made a habit to record how I spend my money now. I'm such a forgetful and lazy person and yet I'm using this app for days and I'm enjoying the whole experience. I'll keep using this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is very useful and fun at the same time. More than tracking my income and spending, somehow the city play keeps me hooked"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its just awesome!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this. It makes me want to keep reciepts and just keep updating to,see how much my city will grow. A really good way to track expenditures"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"stuck at the loading screen and crashes after that ,every single time"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute way to track your spending. 😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is awesome! My only knock is that it feels more of a game than a way to track your expenses. If you could find the perfect balance, that would be great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive, and very fun. Play and function at the same time. :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It makes it so fun to record my spending. I use it in conjunction with ynab which is a full budgeting app but boring! With Fortune City I don't forget to record my expenses"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like this app a lot. It helps me keep track of my spendings and earning. The only thing I ask to be added is to build multiple ""cities"" so we can easily manage multiple accounts. Otherwise y'all have a great thing going for you. Thank You!  On a side note would like to see a workout app similar to the style you use for this and your other apps (plant watering and step counter)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Financial wise, it's a simple basic tracker. Game wise, it's motivating. I hope that the money the city earns was more accurate. The time in the game seems different from real time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to record income and expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app, lacking in options like savings, etc. But great app for those who just started tracking their finance."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just wish that my total money would go on to the next day, just so I can see what I have on a given day. Other than that, it's a cute, fun app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Motivates you to record expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I just love the game but they should add more builder hats to build more buildings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love the app. This app lets you track your spending and will encourage you to do so because of the buildings that will be built but no savings feature for now. Will make my rating to 5 stars if this will be implemented. Thank you Fourdesire! What I think you can do for the savings feature is to add another category that will not be computed at the total analytics or something"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is a good budgeting application."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Tried a couple of money saving apps but discipline is always shortlived. This app really changed d game, pun intended :) genius!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a dope app that motivates me to track my spending and I love how cute it is! It would be even better if there was an option to add categories and to add different payment options or labels for accounts since I don't only use one card to make payments for things. Otherwise, I really enjoy and prefer it to other expense tracking apps that crush my semi-functioning adult soul"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its great but, the builder limited is doesnt give user freedom to expand their city"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A few bugs, but overall clear and colorful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Leaving this as a two star until they add a savings option and time stamps. Otherwise this app actually encourage you to spend to grow your city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I have just installed the app, but I am writing this review because of the UI, I will explore more and update the review."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app. Good incentive to track expenses. Could do with better categories. For example there is no option for savings or investments"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I wish the amount spent in real life reflects how many coins/building level is."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app since i intalled it. I monitor my expenses and also money in my pocket.  I love the concept of gamify app like this.. good job"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A refreshing and nifty take to an expense tracker by infusing a Sims-like game. Nice!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Perfect app but i would like to reset my account if possible to start 2018 right with a financial app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"AWESOME"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's just a simple finance tracker behind the sim city game. If you're looking for more features for a finance tracker, don't pick this. The game style is good for motivating you to continue using the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very useful app ever!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Will give 5 if i can rename or add category other than selection"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It really helps me track the things I have spent in a creative and fun way"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Strangely addictive. I've been able to track my expenses so far."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"All this.. Is just sooo cuuuteee"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Im not a game person and definitely not a responsiblr adult with money but this app makes me both in the beat way. I love it!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Too slow. You hav to wait a lot for the game to progress."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interactive tracking of expenses 💙"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent app I've ever used! But, the only bad thing is, I wanna buy more to get more building!! LOL!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I've only been using this app for a short period of time, but I already really enjoy it! I like being able to track my spending based on many factors including type of payment method, the purpose and my monthly expenditure. It motivates you to keep track of your expenses through the growth of a city, which I enjoy.  I only wish there was also a way you could monitor your savings as well and be motivated to save money too, rather than spend it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting and addicted"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"make me not forget to write my expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app! The game like interface makes me wanna keep recording my expenses! Just one suggestion: besides checking my balance I would like to have a tab where I could see the current amount of money I have in cash and/or credit, like it was an account."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app, gives incentive to keep track of your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like playing this app but for someone like me who basically doesn't have a lot of expenses, I can't write entries everyday. I get the feeling that this is encouraging me to spend on something daily just so I can progress in the game. :("
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a really fun, crisp, and effective way to track your expenses and income."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way of listing expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far the best expense tracking application"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very useful and actually helps me save"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"First app that has kept me motivated to keep track of my spending daily for more than a month! A rewarding game with great graphics. Only downside is that i can't export all the information i keyed in, so the only reference i can have of my spending is through the game. Hope the developers can make exporting of finance data possible in future updates!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Creative way to track expenses and incomes. Makes it easier to budget and save."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very helpful in building a habit. The game and its achievements motivate you to use the app daily."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app..! Combination of finance and game is the most wonderful idea ever..!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very helpful me :) enjoyable and surely you won't miss a day without recording your expenditures. Highly recommended! 👍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wonderful idea. I thought it's impossible to make tracking expenses and saving money fun until I've used this app. I would highly recommend it to my friends. Keep up the good work developers and try to add even better features. I would definitely pay or donate once I can. 👌👍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it! The tool and game works perfectly! Plus i love how i dont forget to type in my input bec the game keeps you checking and the more you input the bigger your city gets!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Just start using this app and i think i like this app. Useful to record your financial status"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app but needs improvement"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun ways to keep track of my expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a fun and neat way to record your finance, without flipping through your book"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Actually makes me use daily"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a cute app. But I wish there was an option add more categories. Would also love to be able to track savings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty neat. Wish it had records for different things, multiple bank accounts, seperate savings, budgeting, etc."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Overall a decent game. Just wish the balance every month takes the previous months into consideration."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great idea for tracking spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cool app although it's kina laggy. Maybe it is only on my S7 edge. Could you fix this? Really low fps and not at all fluid. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app! The missions, chars, vehicles, buildings make me want to open this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is an absolutely fantastic app.  The characters are absolutely adorable, and the cat is to die for. The graphics of this app is absolutely excellent, and everything looks beautiful. The entry system is really well planned and thought out, and I love the way the stats and graphs are organised, and the entries look great.  A few concerns though. People might start faking entries and deleting them to gain the buildings they want. If I can think of this in a few days after installing the app, surely so can others. I suggest deleting the relevant building when the entry gets deleted too.  Another concern is that the entries are organised by the time they were written. I sometimes forget to write the entries at the correct time, so the order of my entries gets messed up. I think it would be fantastic if you could add in an edit timestamp and order option, since that would improve the organisation. Also, many other people have suggested a savings option, which would be really useful.  And it really makes me want to spend as much as I can!  Much thanks to the developers for creating such a beautifully designed and useful app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's an entertaining app for tracking expenses. But its game feature tempts you to spend more just to expand your city"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"App does not encourage saving, you only progress when you spend spend spend. After a week or so you don't earn enough coins to level up at a pace that makes you care about what is happening. Worker to business ratio is off, the concept was good but execution is flawed."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a nice mix of a game and a helpful tool. One of the best thing is the customiseable money reports. Only that the city improves if you spent money makes no sense for a app with which you want to safe money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Definitely helps me keep track of where my money goes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it, The gameish aspect makes me want to use it and record my spending instead of forgetting to put it in. Haven't used it enough to really get the whole of it yet i think but so far so good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Doing budget in fun way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Gamification done right! Really fun game first and foremost and definitely makes you want to keep adding expenses just to see your city grow. Highly recommended."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, basic record that helps me to set goals, create a budget and consider a purchase."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Unique way so far for tracking expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This a fun app but i wrote this to get a vip character😝"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Recording expenses never felt better"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really interesting way to keep track of spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love the idea of turning something as practical as managing expenses into a fun experience! Thumbs up to the developers! Why stop with finance? I think you can also do health? I think that would be a great app and something i would be willing to buy to support 👍🏼"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Quite interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Didnt think i would ever keep track of my expenses but this app makes it fun or feels lile its worth it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Gamifies budgeting and expenses tracking, making it fun and addictive. However some things are annoying - limited number of buildings, limited number of categories for expenditure..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's very good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app, worth the try, will update if I keep using!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wonderful, but long long way to go"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun app so far"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"还蛮好玩的 不过分类种类不够多 不能详细分类消费或自定义分类"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like that it's a game instead of just graphs. My only concern is that there's no way to differentiate between money in my wallet, and money i have in my bank accounts. I hope an update fixes that. :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun to record all your Savings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping track of expenses surprisingly fun and worthwhile! Now I just wish it were more like SimCity where there was more to do like keep citizens happy and such."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool apps, great idea combine games n budgeting apps, really interactive"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Well for one if you want to track your spending, your income and game. This is the app for you! But I do hope it have a budget feature included. But all in all keep up the good work."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great motivation to spend some time listing down expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Geat app 5 stars and very entertaining. If you're worried about you will spend more, let me tell you this, spending more will not grant you a new building once you hit a limit. There's a limit amount of buildings you will get per day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app can make your earnings grow by tracking your money and at the same time, you can play it, avery nice idea."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a good way to understand your spending and saving. You go to understand where your.money really goes and provide solutions on how to decrease those spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A fun way to record all your expenses. But I think you can add in more expense tracking functions to make this app more complete. Eg. Like creating a budget and giving you alerts when you are about to excess your budget etc."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its cute and helps me keep an eye on my spending by making it a game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting concept!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"真的滿好玩的，把記帳變成遊戲，有收藏的元素，會想一直玩下去。比較大的問題是反而太遊戲了，記帳功能沒那麼完整，例如 income 不能分種類，也不能匯出資料或圖表。"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app. Hope you can have the option for multiple credit sources (multiple credit cards) as I wanted to track my spending there. Also it's quite difficult to see graphs weekly or custom. Please improve on that"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app especially for those who want to monitor their expenses. Keep it up!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Gonna try it. Looks promising ang entertaining. I will give my final verdict by a week or 2."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I use this to record my spendings and entertain myself a little"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and makes you feel like you can create bugger plans for your budget."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a cute app, and makes it much easier to remember when I've spent money and how I have left. It's much less anxiety inducing than looking at a bank statement. Haven't played much, but the app refuses to let me log in. Still works, but it would be nice to know my information is able to be backed up. The guide wasn't as helpful as I'd have liked staring out, but gameplay is actually quite simple. I enjoy the humor and many characters involved. Overall, excellent app. Wish I could figure out how to log in."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"For people who's not a fan of just seeing numbers and analytics, but needs to track their expenses and all,  this is for you."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it! Tracking expenses was never been entertaining until this!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like the creative way to record expenses, however my notification wont work to remind me, I think is my problem, good job anyways."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute and it makes recording your expenses fun and rewarding. If used regularly, the breakdowns provide good insight on where your money goes."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think it needs to have an option to have quarterly on the reminder and fortnightly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's great because you keep track of your spending and play a game.  It is not your typical tracking app because the game makes it not boring"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the gamification side of this"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I don't play games on my phone, and I don't keep track of my spending, but I have done both with this app. It's been pretty entertaining."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy to play"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice way to play while tracking your spending, the app is well built but still a bit slow.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Reduce the needed time to get the builder available. It's better to have it ready everytime there's an expense made."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Decent although not great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app very useful in tracking my expenses in a fun way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Not Sure"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"💕💕💕💕"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good way to track my spending expenses yet enjoying my time with this game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I liked it a lot.  A game that you track your your expenses and income.  Just dont cheat your expense or incomd to get an new building. Patience.  Patience"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A very recommended app. A fun way to monitor your spendings and budget."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good way to know where your money flow"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很讚很好用"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Yeh"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"While I enjoy the concept of building a city and getting it to prosper the fact that I can only do so by recording daily spending doesn't help me to budget. I can go days without spending but this app makes me want to make purchases daily to grow my city.   More focus needs to be placed on saving money. A reward system for saving money. Perhaps something like if you record saving X amount you get to use a virtual equivalent of that to pay for buildings/cars etc in your city to build it up. As well as setting a budget for yourself weekly + monthly and city rewards for sticking to that budget. Ex. ""How much do you wish to spend monthly for fun? How much do you need for necessities (rent, food, bills)? How much do you wish to save?""   At this point I am still deciding if I will keep using this app. I enjoy the UI/look of tracking and comparing my expenses but the game part makes it tempting to keep buying to add to my city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I want to be able to switch to cash or credit after I submit a record because I keep forgetting to change it to the correct one when I need. Kinda stupid you can't do something so simple..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Cool idea but ir doesnt help you keep track of money and very confusing game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app, no words to describe"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Clever and fun way to gamify budget tracking.  Would be great if additional categories could be added, but smart idea nonetheless!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Such a nice concept. I love it. But it make me want to expenses more to build rather than saving. Well, it's ok since this app are for record your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I. Love. It.   I just wish I can manage budgets and wallets inside the app. :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Can't sign-up, tried sigining up using Google, Facebook and Email. All of them doesn't work. So, I don't bother trying everything else"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hoping that we can add savings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Okay to"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A great incentive to log my spendings"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Innovative and fun way to track you expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Useful game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The game has a nice concept but it doesn't really help you manage finances like making a budget for each month. It encourages you to spend to advance in the game."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to track ya expense. Simple and interesting. But as a suggestion, since this app main purpose is to track expense, I really do hope that the developer would have a 'budget' function reminding users before they hit a certain amount on their monthly spending.

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great concept! Nice app! The gamification system makes so that I don't skip inserting data, after couple of months I finally have some clear insights on my spending! Thank you!   Some minor enhancement would be introducing the possibility to set recurring payments, like rents, or online services billings, I usually forgot to add them cause they are sparse in different days in the month"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm still trying it out but I already love it. Will definitely edit my review once I'm done testing this app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"How can I  add custom categories?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great must have..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Reminds me of 2048, tiny towers, animal crossing, all the while helping you visually see where your money is going.  It's my favorite app on the app store currently and I HIGHLY recommend downloading it. It's really polished and has made me a lot more conscious about my spending, but in a healthy way that doesn't make me feel bad. Recording expenses as a habit doesn't feel like a chore, but rather, a fun daily thing you get to do to help grow a town.  I also love Cashy!! Great job to the designer/animator. I really feel much better and happier when I click on him and I wish he had more phrases. He's so cute.  Phenomenal app, Four Desire. I liked Walkr back a few years ago but it grew tedious over time. Fortune City really shines as a fun and addicting game that promote healthy expense-recording behavior, which I've always admired about this company. I love being able to see where my money goes visually.   One critique though: for the achievements, there's one section devoted to daily recording of expenses or income. While I log on everyday, I don't always spend money everyday. Maybe if there were an option to say ""No expenses for today"" so that I don't lose my streak?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is a wonderful incentive to record your expenses. It has cute graphics and the idea of building a town over time is something that is not seen in other apps. However, the game could be improved by allowing for more than 5 records per day, because usually we spend money on more than 5 things in one day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and fun! Good mix of budget app and game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its great because its fun while i track my expenses but it will be even better if it can allow us to set recurring charges and separate bank accts"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and interesting way to track your spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game had just made recording my income and related expenses fun and engaging. I look forward in recording at the end of the day for it's fun and this app is well thought."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute app to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"An excellent app that makes me willing to mark every expense every day. Good app that worth recommendation!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"At the start,  I didn't find it interesting because it seems tedious, but it's the kind of app that grows with you, you begin to like it the more you use it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Not bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I was curious about this app at first. When I inastalled it and tried, it didn't fail my expectations on to why it is so good. The concept is that, they really made a very cute game that makes me motivated to tally my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good concept will recommend this to kids"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good idea but would like to add several bank accounts to know my balances. Now you don't even have an account, just start recording income and expenses. Also if you want to progress, you have to record expenses, if you don't have any for a few days, no game progress. Kind of pushes you to buy something to advance in the game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute game help me easily record what I spent. It's not for professional usage, but for personal it's enough."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is actually pretty snazzy. I was skeptical about it at first, but now it's actually pretty addicting! I love the concept; record your spending and you get to build a city because of it. They break it down for you by category, so it's easy to stick things where they belong.  Definitely recommend this app! :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a very creative app that has been very useful at helping out to keep track of my spendings for the last few months. The only down side is that for people who only uses the app to keep track of their budged and they do not play the games that the app gives the city becomes very large and it makes the user's phone become laggy when using the app. Other than that this app is very satisfying and very useful."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Okay la..best.lag sikit hari tu"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Kinda cool, but I can't include a future expense or a future income. Very useful when I'm expecting future payments. If the app do have this option, I was unable to figure it out (yet)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wow love it! This app really help with your spending note. And after the newest update the app run more smoothly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is an incredible app, so much fun to use and great for keeping an eye on my spending :)"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is beautiful and very fun and cool to play with. Very good design. However, it encourages spending, as you get more buildings the more often you spend. Definitely not what I'm looking for in a financing app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app to manage your finances and kill some time making a little city"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep you engaged and posting your income ans expenses"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I purchased the Christmas theme but it didnt show up. Can anyone help?  The app is cute and useful but quite buggy e.g. sometimes the screen freezes and unable to click on thr buildings. Looking forward to releases to fix the issues."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I have mixed feeling. It's definitely will make you track your spending. But it's also makes me want to spend more than I should 😂👌"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is great! The game element makes it really motivating to remember to record your expenses, especially if you spend quite frequently. The only downside is that I personally don't spend money frequently, and I want me City to grow, so it makes me want to spend, in order to record. You have to see the app for what it is, don't give into the cuteness. Stay strong!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Better if I could link it to credit card statements."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The app is great! The concept too! But the features are still a lot limited! I would use this app for sure if it had all the features the other financial apps have, like debts management, budgets, events, maybe even multiple wallets (don't know how you could achieve it, but it could be an interesting challenge), etc... Keep up the good work!!!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute abd fun way to track your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Previously i tried to download another finance tracker app but i got bored and forgot to used it. But with this fun app, i always remember and even excited to post it (because i want to grow my city. Hahaha) recommended app. The idea was awesome."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Still needs a bit more on the subcategories side. I tend to like to see a bit more details."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I seriously have no idea how this app works. I just downloaded it and its not accepting the fact that i spend absolutely no money today? Some insructions would be nice.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting way to track your expenses. I say interesting, cute even, but not exactly fun. Mainly because I have a few issues with it. This app creates a building each time you track a real world expense based on the type of expense it is. So, if I go eat out a lot, but the end of the month I should have a pretty high level restaurant. The problem is, this app tends to make me WANT to spend money in order to build out my town more. Shouldn't I get rewarded for the amount I'm saving rather than how much I'm spending? Seems a little counterintuitive. Since I'm trying to not spend any money, I usually spend the day staring at the same ol' buildings with the little townspeople occasionally asking me to find their car keys for them or some other ""find this"" request.  Seriously though, I like the intention of this app.   Edit: Raised to 4 stars because I found how to add recurring payment reminders so that it automatically places it on your payments for the day you assigned it to and allowed you to check it off when it'd been paid. That will be useful for me and makes this app a little more usable. However for it to be really usable, I'll probably have to modify the dates a little because I want it to tell me in advance what I'm looking at fiscally for the month... If that makes sense. Also, it doesn't sync to my account stand allow me to pay from the app which is an inconvenience that's not really worth using the app for."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I don't know how to play this app..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Interesting! The mini city motivates me to update my daily expenses!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good. Tracking my expenses in a fun way. Great job"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"One of a kind. It's fun and makes you wanna take notes on the spending. I believe much optimization can be done, this app is sluggish."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Sometimes the urge to create the building makes me want to spend some more stuff in real life that I think is a counter-purpose of downloading the app. Can't help it since the app is just so cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like it. A fun way to manage spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It help me to saving.. A little"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"在这里下载的，居然告诉我是盗版，然后所有记录全没了！必须要充值吗？"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A great game that endorse a great habit"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I turn on silent mode of my phone but the app still able to make a sound. This is awkward, if I want to record down in a meeting, library place or any other event if there is a sound."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting way of keeping track of daily spending, but the limitations to buildings and residents kind of lowers the intention to play this as a game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very unique expense tracker. The city building component makes tracking very motivational"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking your money in a fun way. I think it could add a saving account feature to track your savings separate from all other  money"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"although everything had to be keyed in manually instead of linking it to your bank to extract all the details, the gameplay and logic of the app made me diligently log in to the app everyday or after every transaction. I've tried other expense tracking apps and I usually forget or totally give up on them after a few days."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"need to use rill money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute and easy to use, and that's enough to motivate me to record my spendings regularly. Something I'd like to commend in particular is how easy it is to earn in-game currency. There's both automatically generated currency (coins) for every function, and premium currency (diamonds) for town themes and other special features. The app gives you like 2-3 chances to earn diamonds every day, and that makes it even more motivating to go back to the app frequently. It would be nice though if I could completely opt out of the daily notifications, and if there was a feature that would show me my current total balance, not just a summary of my spendings. This app is cute and it's good for tracking cash outflow and showing your spending habits, but it's not for serious budgeting."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Too laggy."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Too laggy... Even on my S8 it runs super slowly and my phone overheats... Even when I deleted most of my buildings it's still very intensive"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nose"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love! It's so fun and keeps you on track!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty fun and interesting game. But please make us customize the categories and add a weekly statistical data."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Horrible scam.First I signed in with my google account and automatically I was alerted someone signed into my account in Los Angeles I live in Chula Vista  theirs no way I did this changed my password and uninstalled scam.SCAM.If you read this don't install unless you want to get scammed."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It would be great if there was a budgeting function!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I want more categories to be choose,  it's not enough."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I dont know whether I missed it or what but It would be good if there's options or something to track debt(in both ways)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I didn't like it at all"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"超可愛"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun little game to make tracking money more fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app to record expenses. I use it in conjunction with MoneyLover to manage my cash on hand."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Laggy..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Occasionally crash but it's fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"i like it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very good and fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I think it's a great app that shows you your spending, but it would great if it can keep track of the amount of money you have and be able to subtract money from that count for spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Quite fun way to keep track of your spendings. Very addictive and also makes sure you dont forget to plug your spendings in. This is the first financial app i've uaed for more than a week"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is pretty good, however it isn't smooth on my phone."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"After I installed I thought my battery drained kinda faster, even when not in use.  Maybe a month later battery is being destroyed, 50% by 10:30am can't figure out why. Deleted. The next day I'm at 70% at 10:30pm. Shame, I liked it at first enough to buy Halloween theme. Gamifying could be better in ways too, the gamify is only building a building when you track an income/expense that you then can merge with other buildings for a few coin to make bigger ones and then put rando ppl to work in them for coin to merge buildings with. That's it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's pretty fun and cute. It forces you to keep in mind all of your expenses so you really see how much you are spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Lags need to be fixed"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep you recording expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"make money management quite fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Clunky animation in a bad way"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Rewards for spending not saving is the only downside for this app/game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I've never kept track of my expenses reliably before. Now I do! It's a cute app that's easy to learn and use. I'm saving money with it too by marking it down as a misc expense tagged Savings. The app is saving me money! I've had overdrafts in the past thanks to pending transactions I forgot about. No longer!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app to tally down the expenses you've made. It's a good way to be aware if your expenses exceeded the total amount of your income in daily basis."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app,  I just don't like rugsthat I have to spend money to build more buildings. There are times where I won't spend money couple of days and so my city won't develop for those days."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It makes my phone hang before I can play any options"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great game, but you need to add more categories! Or even better: you let us customize them to our personal needs! Otherwise, perfect!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great concept"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice graphic, Easy to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"真係好用 jeng(*´∀｀)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is the only way I could be enticed to take a careful look at my spending habits. Great little app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"An interesting app to encourage you record daily expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good for personal budgeting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Needs to be able to automatically sync with bank accounts before I give it 5 stars"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's just very very cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I like the aesthetics and gameplay of Fortune City as gamified expense tracker app. However, it goes against my goal of controlling my expenses since new buildings appear when I put an entry, basically when I spend. So to be able to make a nice city, I have to spend more. Which is sad :("
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app for tracking expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It was perfect before the last upgrade. It now runs at 2 fps, which makes the whole process of adding expenses cumbersome. Shame I'll have to uninstall it if not fixed soon because I really enjoy the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Looks pretty good, but I would prefer to track my expenses without this kind of gamificiation."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Lovely interface, makes bookkeeping a game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It will be perfect if user can customize spending categories.... Some of my spending arent included in the defaults.  And I will also suggest a bank account feature and setting up saving goals or loan returning goals. Honestly I will pay for these features."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really like this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A great app with a lot of potential. I am looking forward to seeing where they go with it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app.  I finally got my gf to keep track of her finances with this."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice to keep track my daily spend"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It would be nice if it told me I was not in a time warp I mean come on I have WiFi I have my time and date set correctly pls help me"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helpful to keep track of where your money goes. But sometimes the ""shops"" doesnt run, and no ""money"" is collected"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"A fun way to help people to track their spending BUT there are a few major drawbacks. There REALLY needs to be a savings category or better yet a way to customize the categories. An export option for people managing their budgets would be a great feature to add as well. I would give 5 stars with the just categories features."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The only drawback is it's so fun it makes me want to spend money to have something to track."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app makes expense-tracking fun. I have tried a lot of expense-tracking apps and this is the only one that can get me to stick to it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It looks like it would be really good, but I want an app that lets me import and export my data...which this doesn't do. So I've uninstalled."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Cute and well made, but there's no obvious way to export or delete your data. Feels risky, uninstalling."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"As soon i signed into to google with this app it said a device in austin texas had logged into my google account. Literally right after i put my password in, do not recommend."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. What I love about this app is that you can have fun while managing your money. On top of this there's a builder system where you can only build certain amount of buildings per day which can really limit your expenses in real life. This app saved me lots of money. Would recommend it to anyone."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Creative motivating way to let people cultivate and enjoy tracking expenses as a habit"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hope keep the standard"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its cute."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's okay and easier to keep track of my expenaes"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good anf fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track your expenses. Some times apps like this, change life! In a fun way I can track my income outcome and make better decisions for the next month"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Some of the shortcomings of the app have already been said, that eventually you hit a point where you have pretty much every building in the game and all the achievements. Still, it takes long enough, and this is a pretty unique way of encouraging tracking expenses... Haven't seen anything quite like it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app, helps me keep track of finances, but I think you should add goals to work on financially."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way of making a tough task interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Unable to open. Loss all my data"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I now know where my money is spent. Every cent!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"First of all this app is like a game which made it super interesting it keeps me entertained while having the motivation to input every single spending moment. although I have it for like only a few days It's already amazing! this will surely help me organize my budget while enjoying it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I love this app, but there's a lacking as a finance app. I wish there would be a budget feature."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I have been trying to install this app since yesterday, and the downloading time is really slow.. I have already restarted my ASUS selfie phone.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"得意 可以鼓勵到記帳"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"liking it so far! it's a fun, cute way to track my expenses and makes me actually look forward to doing so. however, it takes forever to earn gems to upgrade builders, which means I don't want to track any expenses after 5... if I'm learning to budget appropriately, I'm probably not going to spend $$ to unlock my tracking app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"非常實用的app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a cool and interesting app, if you want to have some fun while managing your budget, you definitely should check this app out!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I think this app would be better if they have some homescreen widget that shows balance and debt loan features, thanks really helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very fun and easy to use app - makes tracking your finances into an engaging game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very uesless and interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Was fine until the game hang and there was no way to continue. After numerous try, I had to uninstall and all my data was wipe out. Time to try some more reliable app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"So far so good, people complain that it encourages spending for building count... there is no gun to your head people. This is meant to help you visualize and understand your spending habits.   TAKE SOME PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CHOICES  IMPROVEMENTS ● Lacking an INVESTMENTS category for stocks, savings accounts, dividends (Reoccurring income buildings), to help track your current asset columns ● City fund totals should carryover  ●Add options to have historical data reflect currently on a selective basis from date month or year... for continuity"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love the app saving those irregular recurring payment"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"可以把現實生活變成遊戲的一部分 還蠻好玩的說"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a fun way to keep track of your spending. I like it! It really gives you incentive to write it down when you spend money on something."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I don't believe that gamifying anything could work, but this app changed my mind. Now, I feel excited to record my spending. It's crazy. I like the UI. I like the gameplay. I like everything in this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I wish there was more to do."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is helpful for tracking your purchases, which is great.  I've seen a lot of people complain that you can't build more buildings in a single day, but... That's kind of the point? Like, you shouldn't be trying to make a city that has five new buildings everyday, because then you're making at least 5 unique purchases. Which isn't how you live on a budget. I do wish there were better categories for things. There's no ""groceries"" option. Which is strange since it seems like I go to the grocery store nearly everyday. And I hardly ever buy purses or hats.And there's no category for Bills. Like, I have a credit card and it's in the same category as my groceries?  This is a nice app, but it seems to focus a lot on luxury items and not so much on daily necessities."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So cute and useful! Love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Takes too long to start up for a book taking app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is awesome  Maybe need some improvements"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Manage money and play game nice idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I like a lot. I think the fact that you just have 5 builders is not to waste so much money hmm"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hey. Love the app. Fun way of tracking finances.   One request: can you add a filter for all credit or cash payments/expenses? As the app says, ""at a glance,"" and that could help"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a fun little app that you can see where you spend your money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a cute and simple way to get me to record the money I spend and the money I make. Curious about where my money goes and this will help a lot."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"好玩又實用"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and simple layout!! easy to use!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"funny and record every expense."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app for tracking your spending and enjoying the game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"supes cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good apps.i hope developer add function to record loans and debts like app Money Lover.5/5 ⭐"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good. The developper has got a genuine idea! Wonderful!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excelente. Llevar un control de gastos e ingresos nunca fue tan entretenido."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Edit: changed my review to one star since the devs are clearly using fake accounts to spam the reviews to get five stars. The game is cute but you cannot turn off notifications and they happen multiple times a day. Not even once a day, there are like at minimum ten notifications per day from this app, it drove me insane. Also it encourages you to SPEND money because a day only counts if you record an expense, which seems like it's sort of the opposite purpose of what is intended."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"That's so good... It tells my expenses n I love to know my records... 😊 I am in love with this thing. It is so damn useful."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It would be better if can have few more categories of expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Helps to track spending, with game like incentives to keep up a good habit"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Was enjoying it. Then I was locked out with an error saying the app was pirated and I can't find any reason for it happening."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Intuitive, making it as a 'game', but still very basic to manage finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So addictive and fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A pleasant game to play; not an app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Please add more functions.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It a good finance managment app with intresting feature inside :) great job"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot. I now check my bank account more to see if there are any expances i can put in to further build my city. It's easier then the paper account book i kept before this. I do however wish there was an option to put in ""no expenses"" for a day, that you got a special building or something, as i don't always have days where i have to pay for something."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love this app and I've been tracking my expense for a few months until 2 days ago i can't open the app anymore.... im not sure why but even after uninstall and re-install it i still cant open it... its just a blank page. Can someone help? I dont mind rebuilding my city altho its kinda sad...."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Lovely way to keep me looking forward to recording my expenses everyday! Totally hooked"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Time killer"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"They charged me $5 for nothing. I didn't buy anything and the app said free so I downloaded it. I never accepted any purchases not did I want to only to see my card was charged! For what! I didn't even get anything!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute!!! And I hate budgeting since it's usually boring. This solves it!!! What category is my current ""savings"" under? Not salary or money to come."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's good, but make it easier to get more builders. Otherwise, it is an awesome game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Kind of fun. Concept is great. But if anything, it actually provides incentive to spend, rather than save because the only way your city grows is by spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good apps.. making me want to record my expanses but.. its hard to check the balance of the money since its on the main screen.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Finally an app that motivates me to track my spendings. Does all it needs with an added gaming bit, really cool!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. The style is so cute^^ And in order to build a building, I have recorded my cost for more than 7 days. And I can't wait to record another^^"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is wonderful. I actually look forward to tracking expenses because I want to build my city. The only issue with it is that I actually find myself wanting to spend money to expand my town which seems to be ironic since this is a track your spending and savings app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting App Idea and can be majorly improved as to controlling budgets and more money options or specific accounts like bdo and stuff."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is a good game, the only problem for me in this game is how limited is the population you can have unless you buy more buildings you will only increase your population to one. The rest is all fine, over all great game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it so far! The graphics and sounds are cute and it's fun and interactive. But there's still improvements to be made, it would be helpful to have a budget feature that allows you to set an amount and tracks how much you spend for certain categories of items over a period of time, for example, a day, week, month etc. It would also be helpful to allow users to be able to set what type of format they'd like their analytics to be, for example, they may want to view it on a weekly format rather than monthly. It would also be helpful if you could see your total income or loss balance to see the overall amount of money left or spent rather than just show the sum of incomes and losses for the month. The graphs are really useful aids though and the interface was designed really well."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great idea, but doesn't really help you save money. It just makes what you spend in real life into a building game, sure you get stats but that's it. It would be cool if you could set a spending goal or merge your city with another person's and save together.. Etc"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The concept is great, integrating saving up and gaming. However, this can still be improved if the developers can include multiple account feature, since we don't only hold cash, right?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to track spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun! Tracking my income and expenses have never been enjoyable!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very good way of tracking your money flow and preventing wastage of money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"how do i build buildings?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Cute and fun. My one complaint is with diamonds. To get more builders takes 1000 diamonds and unless you buy from the shop, will take way too long. So I could see someone getting frustrated and not playing anymore."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really great app to make sure that u always keep track of ur spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute and works well but it doesn't bring over the balance from the previous month"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"It's just plain bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is the first budget app where it doesn't feel like a chore to load things. Love how cute and simple the interface is!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"The game is cute & addicting, but has a few flaws. You cannot build more buildings unless you have at least 500 diamonds, which takes forever to save up unless you purchase the diamonds from the game, which defeats the purpose of saving money the game originally encourages. Please fix this & add a library as part of the free parks/community services. Thanks.  Update 11/2/17: Several times I cannot find all the missing items (necklaces, skateboard, etc) in the mini games to earn diamonds. My guess is they're hidden behind my taller buildings of which I cannot rotate. One time I found a skateboard on the ocean, another time a key chain UNDER a building! Please fix this error."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very intriguing concept and kinda fun interface"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"兩次找不到城市裡的滑板耳機之類的"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute app to encourage me manage my daily expense. Possibly to add manage account function such as credit card , saving card ,that would be great !"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Super cute, super effective. I've never been better at tracking my expenses.  HOWEVER, there doesn't seem to be a way to export that data at all, and that limits how useful this app is to me. Would love to see a way to export to .csv or even Google Sheets, and that's the only thing between this app and a 5 star review as far as I'm concerned."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very helpful, thank"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This really helps me keep track of my cash flow, and offers me a cute little game to pass the time with as well!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"😄😄😄"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it, even though I think it might be encouraging my spending because I want to get new buildings, lol."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I have never wanted so much to keep record of my expenses. And I have not missed a single day so far! The best app of this kind I would say. If it allowed manual creation of expenses group and expenses source like multiple credit cards, it would be even better."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This is quite an interesting app. I uses Wallet app from BudgetBakers which consists of a much more detailed category system. Maybe this app could expand on that area. But to create a city based on your spending + animations? Very cool."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is very fancy and cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wonderful interface... gaming whilst building a city up good saving habits.... hats off to teapot"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A cool way to finance."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's  A very good game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Does it's job well."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a pretty well developed and fun app, it was better than I expected"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Still buggy on my phone. It takes some minutes to change the setting such as currency. But so much fun to manage my expenses and also my city!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Highly unoptimized application with a lot of bugs."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The most fun app for tracking down your spendings ❤ a little adjustment I think u can lessen the required buildings to invite townspeople, a lot of my buildings are empty since it requires a lot to invite townspeople"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute..! I love managing my little city and watching it grow. The fact that only expenses recorded that same day get you more buildings gives me incentive to make sure I update my expenses as soon as I buy anything or get any income. I also LOVE that you can change the type of currency you spent. I go to Canada a lot and not having to worry about converting CAD to USD makes this app very convenient. The citizens/visitors are also adorable and have their own little things to say, as well as their own talents,  I love being able to assign them to the specific job they'd be the best at and/or the happiest with. Overall, I am very happy with this app and highly recommend it..~ I just wish I had friends to compare cities with  &lt;/3"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Motivates you to keep track of your expenses, may be add some more export features (to datasheet or over ways of displaying your expenses) ?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to record your finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"its useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"面白い"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is really Brilliant😍 I really enjoy the concept. Gamify your finances with this. Keep up the good work😄"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app so far, no crashes or anything. 4 stars because I think that it doesn't run that smooth, i think frames are low from the start"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's cute and fun, but almost made me want to spend more just to get more buildings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app but somehow it's been a lil' lag for my phone (Oppo F1s) but overall it's a fun way to track my spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is really cute. It's a nice way to visually see what you're spending your money on and makes tracking your spending like a game. The app is very bright and nice and helps make tracking your spending a more positive experience."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and fun and easy to use"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It was all good until after a recent upgrade, it requires a lot of diamond to upgrade the building. Not good."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Janajaj"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's funnnnnn"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"VERY DEPENDABLE AND CUTE, MAKES YOU WANNA KEEP TRACK OF YOUR MONEY"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great way to keep track of spending without being tedious. I've been using it for a week now, and it's actually helped me with budgeting because of the game incentive. The graphics are great, and mechanics are simple. So far the only problem I had was that I didn't realize that I was able to input my expenses/income as cash or credit in addition to viewing the two separately or combined."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love it a lot!!! The only problem is that it makes me want to spend more in order to grow my city 😁"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"interesting app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I loved the game but one thing is I don't wanna hear the word builders available tomorrow ."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So fun and cute. It's a fun way to keep track of your spending and income. Also pretty fun to cimpete with ypur friends to see who can build a better city 😉"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I very in love with app cause it made me addicted to track spending everyday. And I think if this app can export money data to excel or csv its would be perfect to keep me more analyse with data. Cheer"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"GREAAATT APP. Please kindly add a multiple wallet system. Ive got more than 1 wallet so it might be helpful :"" Thanks developers!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this. Keeping track of your spending has never been this much fun. The only downside may be that you want sometimes spend more to acquire a few business. Lol."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and effective app for expense tracking!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Pretty great and fun way to keep track of spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Looks brilliantly cute and motivational to me! This app is designed to help you keep track where your money goes. It's a bit hustle to track all of your expenses on papers. Here's the ideal tool to do that! I recommend this app to those who easily spend their money as they earn. This app could be the very first step for you to be a good accountant :) My favorite method to save money without stressful moments is simple: put all of your expenses into this app, don't let your consuming activities outplay your daily income(simply divide your salary by days). Now you are good at dealing with money! Stay motivated and let's see your money stack up :)  *To a developer of this app* Could you make this app work a little bit smoother? I know it's up to devices, but sometimes it works unbearably slow :("
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the cute graphic"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's fun and interesting and it does help show what you are usually spending money on, but I wish it would track how much money you are using compared to income. It's very difficult to see what you are spending versus money you put in, too. It does not show negative spending or positive income."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"does not accept $0 expenditure for a start"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"That is a great app to encourage people record for their daily spends"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"If only you can add and edit your wallet, not just ""cash"" and ""credit card""."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It would be great that we could also set up more sub categories like loans, snacks, dessert, dinner, lunch,breakfast, ""IOU"", etc. Basically, we manually set up our own sub categories. Automatic monthly deduction from our salary/income. Have personal banks per building based on our respective countries & banks. Have credit cards as a building too. It would be great that we have our own personal reminders for loans, paybacks or debts. It would also be great that we could dress up the Mayor.  Besides that, overall I love the concept! I always wanted something fun while keeping in charge of how I should spend and save money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Liked it until it started hanging..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool Idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is a motivational app where users can enjoy a gamified experience while recording expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a quite great app if it can record more accounts"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's fun and useful but not extremely robust for financial tracking. I also wish that I understood the game mire fully. I don't understand the inhabitant levels. Still fun though"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect. If only there's an ""Owe/Loan"" option."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is so visually attractive, user friendly, and has great customization options."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute and motivating."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it! I've been keeping track of my expenses because it's motivating and cute."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hope there will be more categories!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good app, but it doesn't allow us to export the data"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love love this app! Can't wait for more updates!! More power!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, the game gives me motivation to track my finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很可愛"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"我覺得這個程式很讚 但是我在重新下載後，使用重設密碼 但是它卻一直顯示密碼太弱、需要8個字以上的訊息，不讓我重設 希望可以改善T_T"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great game, add more fitures"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Looks like a promising app, however on the Google Pixel XL the screen is slightly misaligned so I have to tap higher up on the screen to select certain actions"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This game is good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interactive and cute design!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Meh"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"awesome apps!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a sweet little introduction to accounting for expenditure. I think it could use more features and functions before I'd give it 5 stars as it runs the risk of getting stale pretty quickly. But as a proof of concept and surprisingly useful mini accounts tool I'd highly recommend it. I could see even getting kids involved with this to track pocket money etc would be a worthwile lesson in accounting for youngsters."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Trying to gamify expense tracking. But you can buy only one thing with premium currency. Strange and boring on that front."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"lovely game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun and useful at the same time!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"please add saving"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"As you put personal information about your income and expenses I don't understand why it ask for you to connect it with facebook or google. I would like to access everything without connecting to facebook or google. Pretty good apart from that"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice game and nice expense tracker. Makes expense tracking fun. Good job."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I can't open the app for some unknown reason. Please fix. I like this app a lot but can't use it for a while. 😑"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Like it slow"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's very cute."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app I use it all the time and it really helps me keep track of my spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"If can combine account with another phone"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think this app is a brilliant and fun way to encourage people to track their spendings. Really useful and fun as well!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Seems like a lot of fun, but it gives you all sorts of information without telling you how to use it. Like the citizens have levels, but I have no idea what they're for, and the ""help"" section in the game wasn't very informative. Still playing, though."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great fun little app. Really easy to come back to and watch your little city grow!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a really cute way to record your spending. It's like Mint, but it won't track automatically, which makes you more aware of what you are doing and how you are spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"a good app for those who wanna keep a track of their expense"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Tis ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fantastic! Im always eager to record income and expenses in order to build the city. And its very easy to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great idea"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Concept is great, but categorisation of expenses needs to be improved"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and too adorable to forget so I will always remember to log my spendings even when I'm busy. Love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice cute app that finally got me to track my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great motivation to help me save while growing the town."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's quite nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Please fix the bug, the password is useless, it will cancell by pressing return button and may be add an account for bank balance please?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Build a little city while I manages my account. Nice game. XD"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love that it's easy to use, and most importantly, it motivates me to continue using it even when busy, keep it up guys! And I gave them a recommendation to add a grooming category, very prompt reply!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Needs more builders per day, but otherwise it's great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I love it. I do however wish there was a setting to input nothing spent for a day or two as its frustrating not spending money but then losing a streak or something because nothing was logged"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Now I associate all spendings with this app, and I must keep kt all tracked! Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Daily expenses management app with very fun experience"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great way to keep you motivated to track your spendings! But I would like a feature where we can delete multiple entries at once, instead of selecting an entry and the bin every single time. Please put it in the next update!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its nice but it could be nice if we could take a picture of the receipt along with it as we manage our expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good app, problematic user flow. It's just wrong to use first 5 input as building, it makes more sense using the top 5 of the day expense instead. For e.g. I need to change 3 transport to get to work and buy breakfast on the road, so it's already 3 transport and 1 food spent on that day. Even if I buy a $15600 laptop that day it won't count. And I am not gonna wait and input those later for more accuracy."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice game/app. Takes away the boring part of recording income/expenses and instead tranforms it into very lovable city building game. Love the music and graphics. It really deserves a 5 stars rating."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice app, but need some improvement in the ""categories"" section"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The idea is great, but need a certain configuration. Like type of money, debit and credit category need to be reconfigure, and the tutorial can be tweak to more precise. I will hope an incoming update can improve this setting. To be expected, this app a bit laggy on my device anyway"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"👍👍"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would have given it 5 star if local ranking would actually show my LOCAL ranking instead of United Kingdom. I don't even live there. Is there anyway to change that?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It is a very fun game, definitely motivates me to track my finance. But the game setting can be improved, for example, users should be able to view all his/her buildings in a list, with info such as workers, levels, revenue rate, etc. They should also be able to merge buildings and arrange workers from there. Now it is quite inconvenient to do so."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a budgeting app set up like a sum game. It's made to track daily expenses along with income in a very creative and fun way. There are achievements, but they aren't meant to rush you to spend - more so to pat you on the back for sticking with your recordings and making progress. It's cute, the characters are funny & it really does help you get into the habit of looking at where your money goes. I HIGHLY recommend it for young people trying to figure out money management."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I would put 5 if it weren't as heavy"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It would be great if the categories is more various, like learning category isnt suppose to be with entertaining, etc"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"The idea is cool, but somehow they chose some weird categories to track your individual types of expenses. For example, there's an individual category called ""electronics"" where you can track expenses for things like a new camera, phone, laptop etc., another category for entertainment, one for ""shopping"" and then another for ""miscellaneous"". How many people invest in more than one electronic item each month? I would have preferred electronics and entertainment to be one category and have a separate category for sanitary or hygiene and one for clothing instead of shopping."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Best Finance app in the Playstore !!! Honestly I tried about 6-7 finance apps in the playstore to fine a suitable one. And this is what I choose in the end. I you like to play sims at the same time while managing your accounts this is the app for you ! For developers, thank you for making such a great app. i have one slight problem though. Some times my city cant make money unless I connect to he internet. It will be great if you can fix it. Thank you !"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This game had potential but it could improve much better"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Qute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good app, I love the chart as well as the city. Great example of gamifying expenses. I would like if the navbar on tall screen devices as S8 plus can be shown at all times."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good cute App."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really does gamify finance, gives useful stats too. Great for student budgeting!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"The UI is confusing. It's hard to input my income. So everything's negative, as in what I spent."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is totally so good. I love to record my money used but i cant find a good app to record.Until i found this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A great idea. Wish it wasn't such a battery hog though!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"So the idea is great. I love the concept. But the functionality is broken. X buttons to close windows in game don't work. I have to use the &lt; button. Considering all of the great reviews on the game I may be the only one (nexus 5x oreo) SOME buttons wouldn't work either. Confirm button, socks for quest, etc. Who knows what's wrong but as much as I like the concept I have to rate a 2/5 for my personal experience."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Can't open"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its so cute and so useful. I love using it ^.^    However, I wish I would know how to have the app not delete how much I have on balance when a new month comes?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its like, yeay:D"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Needs to use up less battery"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"catagory is less"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Real fun in keeping the wallet and the bank account playable. It makes you want to record your spending and income. One request: splitting income per title in the pie chart!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It is so awesome I can't live without it!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like it 😄"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's beautiful and useful, I'm always updating my data just to get my city growing"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great game to record your finances though you dont have to use it as a game its a plesent bonus that gives you incentives to use it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a cute and practicability app!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a game and a detailed expense tracker in one. This has truly achieved gamifying expense tracking in an absolutely fun way. My only complaint is low fps on my mid-range J7 Prime, but that can be fixed with optimizations, possibly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Buttenss did not match were I touched. Made it useless"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Such a cute app tht helps to track yr finances"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute. Definitely makes it more fun to keep track of your spending habits."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a fun way to keep track of my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It helps me keep track of my siblings in a creative way."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excellent, the best to track your money"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"That's when I realize all my money was spent on food."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun game that makes me keep checking back and tracks my expenses in a great little interface. Its still a trial of self control as theres little reward for not spending but as a finance tracker it serves its purpose well."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"love this app.  one little comment,  please show biggest expenses not just one.  I say 3-5-10 top expense."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would love to see an option to create actual budgets as well as possible linkage to accounts for more ease of tracking expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice game for recording spending"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute and fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's just fun, man. And keeps track of your spending. A game to track your spending? Cool"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute lil game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I like the game aspect, and I understand how it helps you track money, however I don't like it for that purpose. If anything, it encourages spending as that's the only way to grow your city. So now I use a different app to manage my money, and I just make up expenditures on this one to play the game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome game with great concept. Love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app function well. It is interesting that it's like a building game, that make me always remember to mark down what I spend."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to show your spending, a great way to save money, maybe add some widget or notification showing how much money we still have."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awee"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not really helpful for tracking spending as there is a limit to the number of ""workers"" to build on a certain date."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I can manage my money in a really fun way. It's a interesting and useful apps."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Wanted to recommend this app to non English speakers but unfortunately 1, it doesn't allow selection of a locale at startup, going through entire (but skippable) tutorial before allowing language change. And 2, there's no reset button to repeat the process. Not really sure if it's much encouragement as a money saver as all input result in positive gameplay (ie buildings). Maybe add an (optional) display for total balance on default city screen? Lastly but not leastly, it would be good if 3, there was a lock or change history for editing entries. Wonderful interface, the trivia journals were a nice bonus. But all is sadly too cheatable."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like it so far. But im not sure if we can view dairy summary? Not just montly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Not enough categories to cover all my spending. Can't change the name of the category either. What's the point to separate food and drink into two categories? I do not want to see the analysis always have Misc. to be the highest spending. If I over spend on one category this month, it will remind me try to spend less on that category next month. If everything is Misc., it's hard to know where you should be spending less."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"if there a budget expenses would be nice"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It makes actually fun to spend money with this App"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Interesting app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app really motivates me!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It's a neat and original idea, but this is a bare bones city builder game with a TERRIBLE and even more bare bones finance app. If you want to play a city builder there are far better options. Unless you are a kid this app will in no way help you with any of your finances. Tracking your use of your money can be very useful, but if your only doing it to get virtual buildings and you don't understand what to do with the info it won't help you. I use Expense IQ and its easy to input data but it also allows for customization (ie categories) so I can make things specific to how I use my money and it has far better statistics to help me understand it all. Please make a full fledged finance app for adults (the function) with a city that grows automatically as I input data and reach financial goals (saving, staying within budget) that acts as a cool aesthetic. App looks great but all of its functions are done much better by other apps and the way the app combines those functions is pointless, not fun, and not helpful to my life. I can't justify the time spent using my regular finance app which is very useful and then the time entering a lot of the same data in this app just to build a city. Untill you make this a real finance app the rest seems pointless. However this app seems FANTASTIC for kids as their finances are very basic like the app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It really helps me view where I spend my money and how much I'm spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"i think is quite interesting apps~"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun 😊😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"My financial management seems manageable now"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helps gamify saving and spening. I want to save so my goal is to build huge parks.  Helpful."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Best game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love it, is so cute and useful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Enjoyable and fun app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Such a great app,  it's fun and yet I still can managed my money in the same times! But I have one request! Can you make a balance system? It's tiresome to rewriting my current balance every month, it would be great if I just need to put once and the balance will be changed depend on the spending and income. You know like any others money management apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app comes with great graphics and adorable characters to help you track your spending.  By categorizing buildings, you can track which area you spend most of your money on by the growth of your city. Fantastic!  Really motivates me to track my expenses daily."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: A number of bills are debited directly from bank account nowadays, it would only make sense to be able to ""forecast"" future expenses instead of having to wait until appointed date"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Finance tracking should help you save money but this app actively encourages it. To rub salt in the wound, there are microtransactions that become very costly. Wouldn't recommend for anyone actually trying to save money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Fun app to keep track of your financial situation, would be amazing if you guys add a feature that carries forward the balance of last month's income to this month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It's so lagging. The app is not working Smoothly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice design, fun to use, track financial record effectively"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very  innovative"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Funway to record expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very creative way to keep track of your spending. Love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"so cute💕"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"An App that Builds Good Habit"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The idea is very innovative. Now I look forward to listing all my expenses 😊"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Beautiful Ui design, lovely game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Love that it's both a game and a tracking app because it made me want to record all my expenses. But just wanna make quick update request: to have separate 'wallet' and banking tracker. So that ""balance"" seen is separate as well... That will help to see 'actual' savings instead of just tell me how much I spent and how much I seem to have irregardless of my money goals. Please improve."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Definitely a fun way to track transactions and manage money at ease"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I think it would be better if this app can track both cash and account balance separately"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great idea, but the app uses too much battery and the interface is a bit hard to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"It's a huge lag on memory. Buttons are too small."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Keeps track of the daily expenses while having fun. Simple to use."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It shows amazing prospective, but it's very very laggy."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Lack of categories. don't have the ability to add personalized categories."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its good..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"graphics are really cute and i love how i can see where my money goes to at a glance"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way to encourage tracking of expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"While it is a cute way to track your finances, I feel like the app rewards you more for spending that saving since it require more coins to upgrade your city. And the more stores you have from buying in real life to creates more buildings to produce more coins."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is really cute and makes me think about my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love it! Great app to keep track of ur money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Too bad only 5 builders per day, but overall ok &lt;3"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"Its a good app but the only problem is, why is there a limit to the times we can record our expenditures. We can only record 5 times a day. It doesnt make sense at all. How can we record our money (the main purpose) real time if we can only put up 5 records of it per day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I agree with a lot of the other reviews. Cute game that allows you to track your spending; the analytics and statistics section is really useful as it gives a visual of your spending habits. But I dislike how I'm restricted from inputting more than 5 transactions a day, and how gaining more citizens isn't possible unless you have more buildings. More buildings=more money spent, and I'd rather not be spending it. The purpose of downloading this app was to track spending so I could see any unnecessary expenditures, and adjust accordingly."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"interesting idea. but the finance tracking part is too basic. Not good."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking your spending. I've tried other apps like Good Budget, but I would quickly lose motivation to document my spending. This app, however, is very fun and low maintenance and low stress. It actually makes me want to spend money so that I can see what new buildings look like. :P  The only thing I would change is the tutorial section. I didn't know you could log that you didn't spend money for an entire day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's a decent tracking app, but generally seems designed to coerce the user into spending money to advance the game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The best money tracking app ever build"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is a cute way to track what your spending and seeing where your money goes! I only wish that it didn't restrict the amount of visitors becoming citizens because you have to make more buildings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's quite amazing... cause I have a lot of expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"I like this game, however I find it strange that you have to spend money to get buildings. The whole point of managing my finances is to stop me from spending unnecessarily and this app makes me want to spend more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So good 💖"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It make recording the expense fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good and funny way to manage the financial status . Recommend app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Its really cute and interactive."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Would appreciate if there is the option of not having auto populate fields and fields of parks when there is no expenditure that day. Now i have a problem of too many parks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Excelente app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Hmm... 5 builders... a target for not spending in more than 5 categories a day? An import/export data and go with accounts would be better."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Good app but there are some bugs in achievements. Can't gain some achievements specially on salesman achievements."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is a good expenses management app. It gives me an incentive to actually keep track with how much I spend during the day, and it really gives me a proper outlook on how much money I use daily to weekly to monthly. It is also extremely helpful for logging down expenses for my economics class."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Really well executed, but slightly lacking in depth. As far as I know, the city building actually encourages to spend more real money, which goes against the aim of being more careful with one's spendings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting app. Cute design and easy interface. The restriction on buildings is dumb though. You mean people don't spend more than FIVE purchases per day? Defeats the purpose of recording expenditure if you ask me. Other than that it's nice to play while taking a break from other games."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like the concept. The game reminded me to record. =&gt;"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Makes me want to record every single  thing I spend and earn."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun and additive to manage your money. Just wish that perhaps you may include purchase buildings from the shop for individuals that don't spend every day (e.g. students)."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"IT is really interesting to build a.city."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"希望有地方可以看從以前到現在的總收入和支出，或當月餘額take over到隔月"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Its a good way to keep track on your spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's good to keep track of your finances."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"很可愛"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a cute way to track money, but it's hard to build up your city when you aren't a constant shopper."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It works. Turns my addiction to level ups into a good thing."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Easy to keep track of my spendings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad. Gets you more into documenting your purchases for the day."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"cute n useful apps ever"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Like someone else said, a savings account option would be great. Thay way you can see the money you save, as well as spending. I can already see that I will need to copy my ""savings"" across each month. Otherwise its a brilliant app for what I need it for."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"🔹Really good for getting people that like games or town building that also have trouble tracking all spending in one area.  🔹cute characters and descriptions. 🔹decent charting of spends."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"You have to pay for diamonds to even move forward in this game... It is tedious. You should buy an Xbox and pay for a game that has more bang for your buck. These phone games are getting out of hand with the prices. But besides that, enjoy it... All these game play on patience; so if you have none then you will spend a lot of money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love it , now i dont have to worry about my money anymore . And i really like to grow a city ."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Should add an option of 'Savings' among the categories. Also, if the calculator also had multiply and divide function, or open to a more functional calculator, that would be great."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I've been looking for something that was simple but also made me want to track my spending. This does just that! I can't end my day without tracking!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great gamification of basic spending tracking. Not especially sophisticated, but a great way to start tracking your finances with gentle encouragement"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"App too slow"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good to keep"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its nothing like a dialy money management. Its does not have builders and the should be determined by the money used and by merging. It needs something more for daily registration"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think it is better to have account management, instead of credit and cash, so it is easier to management different means or different cards"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"not fun. note to self: dont download this again."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to help recordd expenses. :)"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Well...It is FUNNY. However, it's useless if I can not add a new payment. Do I only have card and cash？And why can't I set up the amount in the beginning?So I uninstall it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Need more of that free builder....."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I think this is a super great app for anyone who wants to look over their spending habits and not feel bad, me being a person with many stress triggers. I am able to look at my expenses and think back to how I can spend less while at the same time not limiting my expenses."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Overall, it's very interesting and fun, makes me wanna keep recording my spending.. The only problem is the limited amount of builders daily and the amount of diamonds needed to upgrade the buildings to higher levels.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"What this app offers is good, it makes me want to go back and use it. But, I don't know why they put a restriction of number of builders people can use a day. It should recharge within certain period of time instead of a day. Also it requires specific number of buildings to get a new citizen but my town is already almost empty and most shops are hiring... They say I can't get more citizens unless I get more buildings? That doesn't really make sense to me"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great app to track finances in a creative/constructive way, though the purpose of growing the city and upgrading buildings is a bit.. vague. Some more explanation or ""perks"" for merging buildings and upgrading your town hall would be a welcomed addition. Otherwise, it's great!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great. Thanks developer."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice gamy :-D way of keeping eye on spendings etc"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app & game!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This games is ok"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep track of your finances. Especially if you need reminding or some sort of motivation. Joining budget tracking with a game definitely does the trick for me."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"For an app which supposedly aims to help users better manage their finances, and cut back on unnecessary spending, it's more than a little surprising to see in-game credits available for purchase. That's right - don't save that money, spend it on Fortune City! 🤔 It's easy to see where this games loyalties lie! 😂💰💰"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Please add a way to change the currency of a specific transaction"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Best city building app... I can track my spending too.... Well done #FOURDESIRE !!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute. Wish there will be more columns for prepaid cards or credit cards."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app might be /too/ fun. I'm finding myself wanting to buy things just to record them and get new buildings!   Otherwise, it's a simple and good way to track your spending. The only problem is that I wish there were more builders to start with."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Loved where this app was going but once i saw the relation to other games that want you to come back and take care of the population I ininstalled. I am all about games but I dont want missions involved in my finances. I love the way you could gain achievements though that on its own without all the rest of it, it would have been fine. I could have personally used a little more finance and a little less random character missions."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"I love the gamified concept! But im having difficulty migrating the data from my old expenses app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's cute and pretty easy to use. I just wish you didn't have to sign on through other programs to use thingd like the pet expense option."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"For some reason this app makes me wanna spend a lot 😂😂 it's so cute!!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would be better if could auto in put financial information"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This is a great app to motivate me to keep track of my spending! I wish I could keep track of more than one account, but the system is really clean and useful. As for the ""game"" side of things: it makes it very fun, but the ""you need x many more buildings to invite a new citizen"" feels kind of like a draw back. Wish I could rate 5 stars!!! Super cute!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fun game good way to monitor your spendings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I thought this was a finace game"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really cute, and I like how simple it is."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A really cool interactive way to keep track of your spending!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Good for developing positive money habits. Room for improvement"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very useful and fascinating!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Its cute, and I found it to be reasonably motivating to try and maintain the habit of recording expenses. It's advertising heavy, but you can pay for ad-free, so I will say I am mostly impressed."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It is fun and useful. However, I've got a question. How do I get the diplomacy envoy achievement?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"New models of finance apps, hopefully it will make me easier to see how much spending i did everyday. But sometimes i have more than 5 transaction in one day, so its sad that i cant build something on the 6th transaction"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Pretty good for tracking my spending and keeping me mindful!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"great design and encourage me to keep track of my expenses every day"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Juat started using this but it's really cute! Hopefully, that'll encourage me to keep using this for a longer period. It would be nice if there was a budget feature."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way to track your Expense.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I really love this app!! A great way to manage and keep track of your spending. I've had many many apps before to try and help myself budget and see where I'm spending my money overall. Most of the time it's hard to keep up and a lot of apps call for your bank info! This game is so simple yet it's a lot of fun and I look forward to building my city each day by keeping track of my finances! Wonderful idea I highly recommend!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"This is a great app to track spending. But I would like it if it could show how much of my expenses are going into each building. I got two shopping buildings from only one shopping expense. Unless you start with one for the tutorial I can't remember. It's confusing. Otherwise great. Don't buy diamonds, you get them free watching ads."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Interesting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The small town aspect is so fun but encourages you organically to build better and bigger! I'm excited to track my spending for the first time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app. It limits you to 3 buildings a day so it kinda helps with limiting your spending. It would be nice of you'd allow more buildings on a daily basis, the unlimited tracking is really cool though. Different ads make it surprisingly interesting!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"This app is a lot of fun, but it seems like it doesn't actually earn income properly from the businesses in my city. I've been stuck at 144 gold for days now even though I have 7 employees working. The businesses say stuff like ""34/H"" but that doesn't seem accurate. I don't understand what is wrong."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great design , new era finance apps"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So easy to keep everyday cost."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app, really encourages me to log my spending and income."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This awesome it gives me the option to punch in every details. I am bad at saving when I type the amount i spend really get the total piture. And saving just becomes the next step automatically. And u get to manage a city lole the cherryon the top. Really good app for people who wanna save amd keep track of their money."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app.  It's so entertaining and fun and keeps you up to date with your finances and spending. Makes you learn to control."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Uh..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Cute interface and reporting. Good flow in adding transactions. However it seems like the financial app is only secondary to the game. I would like to have the interface without the game."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Never forget to record my spendings with this app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Simple, easy to use. Only recommendation I'd make is to allow exporting for better documentation. Keep up the great work!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very fun and keeps me tracking no problem. Using back button on my S7 is a little awkward at times, like when I want to lower the keyboard but it exits out of the editing menu instead (with the keyboard still raised). Might be a bug but that's all I've noticed.  Edit: I forgot to mention, I have two bank accounts. It would be nice to have an ""add card"" option so I could keep them separate when I log my income and expenses on them."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very nice app to spend time to track on my expenes one suggestion to business team kindly add bill paid options in categories"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Would be great if there is more category, like sports etc."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very good! It's a very creative app that makes you want to write down everything. The only thing I would add is the option to see you all time savings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Could be better. Please add and option to add or remove categories from the list. We should be able to add our own categories. I would like to add something like investment/stock categories."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a little difficult to grow your city when you don't spend a lot, but it keeps me consistent!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice way to keep your expenses noted. Thumbs up!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Need more builngs"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Rly good app great for tracking your money and not wasting it etc would be FAR more useful if it had negative bits for loans etc. And if you could split your money in to different bits so you could track your current account balance and your savings account balance separately to your cash in hand and travel card credit for example"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Not Bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great App! Learning how to save money fast!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"If you will tell me the differences between buildings like ""sushi restorunt"", and the ""village hot dogs"" and other similar buildings other than the look, I will give you five stars"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun way to do mini finance. Categories and details should be more variety."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! I love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Super cute!!!! Wish they would add more ways to get diamonds like more of those little clipboard tasks 💎"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Cool game download it now!"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very cute app. But it takes time to input my spending record. I would rate 5 stars if it has a widget to speed up the input."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Needs savings! Will give 5 star if implicate savings, resembled as maybe a bank building!! Thanks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good motivation to start your finance tracking"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"實用又好玩"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A person who make this is a bad ass"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Just didn't seem fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Very creative app & way of keeping recored. Have lot more potential to grow in to something even more attractive with more financial record keeping features..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great app! It makes me input my purchases everyday! But I just wonder, why so much parks??"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very creative finance tracking app. The only app that makes me input data everyday. One thing to suggest, why not allow the previous months balance to carry over to next month? Also add more categories, such as ""Business"" category."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"Horrible!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Fun app to help me track my spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun. I like to see where my money is going and this makes it much more fun. Thanks"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Hey ui is really not user friendly"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Not fun"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"LEGIT!!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is THE BEST MONEY MANAGEMENT APP EVER!!!! THANK U!!! U SAVED MY LIFE! Keep up the good work guys! ;D"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good. If it doesn't heat too many battery on background, then it will be better."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's fun and convenient! It makes more interest when you do the finance mangement."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Nice keep it up!❤"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Can't wait to write down my spendings every day, which really helps, as I'm a forgetful person."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Good motivation to keep you on track with your spendings."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Very cute app and it would make u so excited about tracking your money😍😍😍 Easy to use and having all the functions I need."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Cute little app to encourage tracking spending."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Please optimize the FPS of the game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome app that makes managing expenses fun."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Agree with the reviewer that it seems to encourage spending. Or at least assumes that you spend/earn every day. That's kinda counterintuitive. How about a bonus on days when you /don't/ spend?"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Awesome simple way to keep track of your finance"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Fun little app to help introduce people to finance management and tracking. It does seem to passivly invite people to buy more (to get more buildings and the game will also throw 'reminders' at you to track purchases if you haven't submitted anything that day). I would like to see more sub-catahories as well. Groceries/eating out/junkfood instead of just one ""food"" catagory."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great expense management app. Please add a feature which let's us add our own categories and remove defaults."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Love this app much, its so cool to see what my money goes into, and you should also add a savings category ."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Helps me keep track of my expense.  Sadly I don't spend much to begin with and the game progresses by entering expenses. So I am progressing really slow.  But this makes it fun to track instead of traditional bookkeeping."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"A great game-money budgeting game-app innovation. Graphics are good,but too cute for me, anyway this only can manage basic expenses or income. If you into more complex budgeting this might not for you, but if you're just need daily tracking then this is recommended."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very cute and effective"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"A very interesting way to the bills"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Money management is now much more fun :D"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great fun app/game to keep track of spending. It mixes Farmville with bookkeeping. Only downside is that it encourages spending in order to build buildings rather than saving."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"nice app for simple accounting"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Fantasic its simplistic design and ease of access is wonderful. The fact that a financial organizing app is tied and hidden within a beautiful little town builder game gives it a whole new meaning to tracking your expenses"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"No"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"I really like this app! The only thing is, it encourages me not only to track my spending, but to spend. I'd love some sort of reward for not spending as much as usual, or something along those lines!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This is the most motivated I've ever been in recording my finances. It is a brilliant idea, fleshed out so well—design is amazing. I admire the attention to details, even how ads are presented. Gosh, even the game citizens have profiles. My only suggestion is for this app to present a few tips, if not a tutorial. It was confusing at first. All in all though, a beautifully crafted app!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"very great finance tracker"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"If we can use this apps to record our savings I think it would be better."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Have much potential"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I ever used track record of my spendings, but it didn't last long. This app is very interesting and well made, because it motivates me to keep updating as my city grows! So cute and absolutely love it!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Need a function that last month's saving can be accumulated to the next month."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Any way easily change lots record currency? Last update change my NTD record into USD when I setting English language & NTD currency…"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"The app is pretty cute and makes me wanna track my spending more. Can't stop noticing some funny grammar mistakes in the citizen descriptions lol its not a big deal tho. Hope you can add some more customization options in recording categories. Great job!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. I am enjoying the app and I find it very helpful, but I would enjoy if it had a 'notification' type thing that stayed in the notification bar reminding me to input my spending habits. As I forget to quite often."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"This app is awful. It makes me wanna go out and spend money so I can track it in the app. I never forget too track my expense any more."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Like the concept but wish I could schedule autowithdrawls ahead of time."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",1,"I dont get the point of the app..."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Useful and interesting"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Really good app with cute mini game!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"Like the app. It's a little laggy and the female characters should have appropriate names! Overall, nice combination of finance app and game for those who are not winnable only by first part.."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it makes budgeting alot more fun!"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Nice concept. The game keep me to use the apps daily to make sure i can get the achievement. However the categories are fixed and cannot be customized to user's needs."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Util para o q eu precisava"

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Great way to budget. Motivates you to put your expenses in"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's a cute app and game, but you have to enter all your payments and it encourages you to spend more than save as you get buildings for spending and people to live and work in the town once you have x amount of buildings"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"It's good"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Finances make anyone anxious. This app helps me e joy keeping track of my spending, and make better decisions about how to use my money."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Great money tracking app."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Expense Tracking. GREAT. Now add other things: customize categories, cash/debit/credit. Customization would would great - one might have income from different jobs and may want to account for that. Maybe add a way to see which pf ny expenses are of each building."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",4,"Everything thing is good but kindly add currency in rupees"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"It's a half decent financial management tool, but with a strong game layered on top of it. Just be sure that you can avoid the entire freemium model. The only thing I paid for was about $3 to remove ads"
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",5,"Super cute app. Really helps me track where the money's going. But I feel like the achievements and building the city really tempts me to spend more money. Otherwise, great app."

"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",2,"cumbersome for keeping track of finances. But has a simulation game aspect that probably will appeal to many users."
"Fortune City - A Finance App","Unknown",3,"It's nice to have all Currencies but as I use Hebrew I would like at least rtl support in the notes (example: ""word"" writed as ""drow"" when I try to use hebrew"
