"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The app is best for those beginners who dont want a pro level editor for 30 and 60 fps videos that are max 1080p resolution, a really nice thing being the absence of watermarks, which are otherwise a paid affair with the other applications. It misses out on some useful editing tools, such as apply fade in and fade out effects on any frame of the video, and addition of doodles/stickers at any frame of the video. Please introduce these features that make this editor a complete one."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Got scammed on their website. The same people who run it runs this app. If you must use their service then use a visa gift card so they can't keep charging your bank debit card like they did me and refuse to refund me. Be safe."

I have nothing but horrible experiences with this company. It takes me a week or longer to create a video. Why? Because it takes about a good hour to get a search to show results. No problems running newest pc games or anything online. I have the fastest internet available and InVideo is the only platform I have problems with. STAY AWAY FROM INVIDEO"

Aside from that, it's great, it has separate edit tracks for video, voiceover, text, music and still frames for seamless transitions and fluid synchronicity. Great app."

I love the regeneration option and that you can edit the final video, by simply changing the details. You can even clone your voice in the paid version. 1 thing is the desktop version is Amazing, I just wish the app on my phone was able to function the same. When this happens, I'll return with the 5th star. Thank you, for creating this platform!"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It's like being all hyped up and in the end not living up to expectations. Disappointed in this software.

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Downloaded and created 2 different accounts but there aren't ANY options to make AI videos as advertised. It literally is now only an app to edit your own videos. You have no options to do anything really, no account page or anything. Confused on who uses this and how......wild."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Installed, click create project, ""you must enable permissions to create a project"", doesn't tell me which permissions, tried a few, still doesn't work, Force Quit, Uninstalled App. Okay a tad unfair becos the website is pretty good. The AI startup market is flooded. Most of them using similar pricing, which is around the $20 a month level, and that's if you pay ~$240 for the annual plan. Realistically, there are going to be losers. Winners will see value in cheaper short term pricing"

The AI does not attend to your work order, making it very frustrating, eating through stock visuals I don't export for downloading or purchase and eating through my well-earned money .. Not very happy at all about this 1 year subscription"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"DOESN'T WORK AT ALL! App says it won't work without permissions. Hitting allow takes me to my settings which I enable everything. Force close the app and still tells me that I need to allow all permissions. There is nothing else I can do."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The create ai video text prompt isn't appearing. Only ""create new project"" which uses files on phone to merge and edit. I'm using Android. On tutorial videos, the users are all on iPhone. Does the invideo app only work correctly on iPhone"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"How do you post on YouTube and hide the clips on ur video ?"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Although the interface is easy to use and intuitive, I would have preferred it if it included all of the features found in the online version of the website.

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Scam don't download or use"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even deserve the one star but gave it to be able to tell you that you are liars and none of the features you descibed is available in the app 😞"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Downloaded specifically to be able to increase playback speed of a a video that was accidentally recorded in slow motion. Nowhere in the app settings in the are the editor tools is there anything to allow me to update or change the video playback speed as I was informed it would do in the tutorials that I wasted an unnecessarily long time only to find out that those options are not provided."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"At first it works great, but it keeps freezing every time I am editing."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Can barely open the app. I wanted to put two video clips together, it would literally be a 16 second clip once done. It would let me make an account, add the clips, but as soon as I got to the editing process it will play through the first clip, but as soon as it is supposed to merge into the second the app just crashes and takes you back to your homepage. Tried again multiple times and same thing, it will play the first clip and crash at the point the second is supposed to play. Unusable app."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I really love this bc I wanna be a YouTuber"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Why is this app different than the Apple version??!!! This is not fair at all!!!! Android users want the SAME ACCESS!!! I wanted to create faceless vids for You tube!! Which your Apple version offers."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app for video editing."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Created an account, but the only option that appears is ""new project,"" and to use it, a video has to be uploaded - it doesn't seem to offer any other promoted functionality in the app, like choosing a template video and similar, which is a bit disappointing. Also couldn't find any options from the app to manage subscription, but as most functionality options are not available from the app (assuming this is a legit InVideo app), then managing subscription in not needed anyway... ☹️😒"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"One of the worst video editing app ever on mobile and also on desktop. With hard work I was able to edit a beautiful video on desktop and now we have to pay for export. First of all it says free and now it's premium to export. I don't why people create apps like this that even didn't work. Hate on this app"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I really liked this app up until I tried to export the video, and the app just was not processing in the background. It would only process if I had the phone unlocked and the app on the screen the whole time. I went through my settings to make sure the phone was not sleeping background apps and to make sure the app had all the permissions it needed, but still it would not process unless I was looking directly at it. Not practical for large videos."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Not too bad of a little App"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"InVideo is a leading video generation and editing software known for its features and ease of use. I chose InVideo after comparing other software options. I was initially pleased with the deal offered, which included the new AI video launch. However, I later discovered that the AI video launch was not included in my plan as promised. Despite reaching out to customer support multiple times, I received no response. I want to warn everyone to be cautious of InVideo's unethical behavior. Be careful!"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I was trying the free version and it kept stopping and going back to the start new project button.

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Never heard of app until I got email saying they were going to charge me for it. Loaded app to ""unsubscribe"" but there's no menu item for that.

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used invideo on a desktop and loved the experience but on the phone the features are very bad. Facing an issue with the audio as well. When on the app the audio seems to work fine but when I save to phone it has a lot of disturbance in the audio."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",4,"The best app ever"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love convenience for stitching together a story direct from the phone. As a inventor/engineer, I take hundreds of pictures and short video snippets. The problem is they build up as individual pictures with no names or context. This app lets me quickly stitch them together while I still have context. Adding text and voice overlay helps contextualize the story. Working on the phone helps me discover missing segments while I still have the subject material available."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I can't figure out how to speed up a video. Looked at stuff online but the interface is very different from what I downloaded. There are other stuff on the app that I think helped me but unless I figure out it someone can help me figure out how to actually speed up or slow down a video then my rating will stay at 2 stars"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"It's a good movie video editing app, when it works, but it's very unreliable on Android (tested across multiple devices) and no cloud synching between mobile app and the browser based video editor like what you get with Canva for example. You also need a paid account to upload video files over 200mb to the web based/browser based editor."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I have a project which I am working on via the web version but the same is not reflecting in this app version. It will be great to sync both web version and all, so that we can continue to work on our projects and don't get to loose time."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Great App So far 👍, Works well ☺️,Is it Free Though,????, Developer Team Well Done if it's FREE,!!!!"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Handles video and stills okay, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to adjust music volume or fade in / fade out of music or audio tracks. In addition the music that is supplied with the app is not public domain so get ready for copyright strikes. This is the pro version. Disappointed in in video all around. I can't believe the desktop version or the app are as highly rated as they are. Really clunky interface. More frustrating than fun."

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"As I went on my journey to find a high quality video composition tool I shortlisted the best 3 apps money could buy and InVideo's solutions were one of those 3. The software is user friendly, powerful and an absolute pleasure to use, it's packed with tons of timesaving features making the video creation process a breeze. The team behind the scenes are also very friendly and I fondly remember our interactions. This software really packs a powerful punch you should definitely give a try!"

"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I see negative comments here and had a laugh. Like what do you guys expect of a mobile video editor? I love this app because it allowse to quickly prototype an idea while on the go and ask friends for views before going ahead to perfect it on desktop. Being on the phone, it allows me to see the full real estate of the screen and how viewers may likely react. Can this be used as a standalone video editor? Yes, if you have your own clips or don't mind stock clips."
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It'good for social media videos it's easy to use"
"Filmr - Pro Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great addition to an amazing InVideo web video editor. Now I can easily edit my vids on the go.

Too few transitions but the included ones are usable. Unable to import any music, which is one of the main reasons I needed this app. Always stuck either downloading (it never makes any progress and almost always freezes the app) or searching.

with a background image, that the user can select or a static color and 
then write whatever the user likes. This app reminds me of an app I had on 
my old windows phone called MovieJax, and it had the function to add frames 
with text on it(and I could also choose the duration of the frame) and it 
would be amazing if this application had the same feature :-D Sorry if my 
English is not perfect but I only study it at school"
