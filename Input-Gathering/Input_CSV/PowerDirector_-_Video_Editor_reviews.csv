"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good very nice editor one of the best experience in app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"My creativity has no limits here"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Makes my social media videos a breaze to create. Fast and intuitive. My favorite!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The one star is because as usual you can't save the video that you've made unless you buy their premium software. Total waste of my time. Not only that you can't find a simple fade out of video clip without going to a lot of unnecessary work like adding a color board to the overlay track."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It is terrible don't waste your time. I edit my videos perfectly,and when I went to export the audio is good in the beginning then it gets distorted extremely bad. Does anyone know how to fix this? I paid for this app and cannot use it üò¶"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to love this app, but as of late it keeps crashing, videos wont play when I try to preview them and it just freezes. I try toubleshooting and have reinstalled the app and deleted all my stuff etc and the last solution is for me to wipe my phone apparently. Which is something I'm not going to do. My phone isn't the problem it's the App. It's often been unstable. So until it is fixed, I will be cancelling my subscription and looking for a better alternative that is stable."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Video preview playback is very faulty, I often have to leave the project and open it back up for it to play"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"One star for the unnecessary notifications all the time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good üëç"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I like that it gives you a chance to try out the paid features. How many times have I paid for an app only to think how I wasted my money? Too many! You have to 'earn' the paid features but it's all good."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over 5 years. The latest update has taken away half of my transitions, many are my regular transitions like split advanced and lifestyle."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"üíØ"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I have subscription of power director but when I update this app I am not able to access my subscription."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful for editing install this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"A good CAPCUT replacement. Still not as good as CAPCUT but it's close."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I came back to power director after a couple of years of using capcut both on the mobile and on desktop. Power director has come a long way and I'm happy to be back. Works perfectly for what I need it for!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The app it's great, they keep adding and adding more pc like editing software features in the app, but once the project it's over 20minutes there's times when the app lags a lot, so laggy that it's impossible to use, so you have to get out and back into the project to continue, I use the app in a S24 Ultra so....There's no way is the phone"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"STOP MAKING EVERY EFFECT PRO MAYBE NOBODY WOULD COMPLAIN???"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing product"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It good for editing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Please solve The given below problem not solved. Please recheck once Again When I increase the speed of the recorded voice, aftet that coming voice is not heard properly .please check& rectify. This problem was not solved"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Wow amazing but I think their is very much amount for pro"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"No free version!!! Either pay subscription or pay for credits!!! Either way you don't get to test the app before wasting money on it. No thanks maybe if there was a free trial!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"It's a great free tool but the level of audio desync is so infuriating"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It's got the basic features for a video editing. I just don't like that the watermark is so big and you have to pay to get rid of it. I hate that I couldn't also do the editing manually in my phone like I used to do which is why I got the app but I paid like 1k for a phone that can't splice videos together. Wasted money really."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very happy with the usability of this video creator."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Serious bug lately with all my videos I'm trying to make whether it's a game or real life or whether it was captured in 1080p or 4k. I keep encountering a error during export on a lot of my videos I'm trying to make and even after downgrading resolution or even when I click continue after it asks if I want to downgrade it still gives me an error message resulting in absolutely no ways to export my videos besides restarting or giving up been using the app for years nd recently strted having issue"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Would never download: I even tried the free trial to buy and it would never download the video I edited past 5% without crashing out... it was a 33 sec video. Had to cancel sub twice on different accounts."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Really a powerful app for editing and producing videos of quality. It was super easy to set up sharing to YouTube and my other online accounts."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work with most file formats, like H265 used on modern GoPros. The file browser is total garbage, and doesn't allow you to select files by a 3rd party, and the app doesn't show up in the system as way to edit video files. Developers are too busy shoving useless AI content into the app to fix fundamental issues it has."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm in the 7 day trial and is got alot. I may subscribe. I do several videos a week, so it makes sense to have this."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Not working for me anymore"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I have always been a fan of this app..... It's litttt.... Thanks Cyberlink team for giving us sooo good app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"LOT OF FAKE REVIEWS ON HERE. It sort of works; the export/output of the final product is just sad. Quality of editing (1080p) gets cut to about 480p(if not worse) as you finish. The cherry on top has to be the watermark, nothing like a stamp of approval on a low quality video. Would NOT recommend it if you need higher quality videos."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"*Update* They made a lot of updates and changes. I'm back in the flow of enjoying this app again. Highly recommend!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Full of glitches now. As soon as you add a sound it freezes and you're unable to do anything. Tried uninstall but same old issues. Long time user. But won't be renewing."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't do anything without paying for a subscription first. Wasted time downloading and using"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Except for copyrighted music"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Not worth paying for"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Your Video Editor used to be fine and normal and we get get things for free by doing stuff for the reward, but ever since half cost money and stupidity about ""error decor"" Bruh shut up, I can't even edit in peace! it freaking annoying! Fix this bug. 2 out of 5. I take it back, it worse from before. It so freaking annoying that I didn't even made ONE edit yet! 1 out of 5"

Support team told me to take it up with google and quit replying or attempting to understand the issue after a single message.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Changing my review to 2 stars because the app keeps messing up my pro subscription. I'm still paying for it monthly, but it's currently showing I don't have a pro subscription. The last time it did this, there was an update that fixed it. This time there's no update. Another update: the only way to fix it was to uninstall the app and reinstall it, which got rid of my projects. Nothing the company tells you to do actually works. Restoring purchase does not work. Google tells me it doesn't restor"

Checking the reviews, i obviously know that you actually care unlike other weird apps that say ""tHaNk YoU fOr YoUr FeEdBaCk! We wIlL fIx It"" and not fix it. Thank you! Edit: I always relied on this app for my old gacha videos I never posted. You a real one frfr üî•üî•üî•"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome, im planning to purchase!!!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"You have to pay for each device. Not worth having to pay for 2 subscription ."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's fun and creative but better for long form videos."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant App and as a novice content creator it is easy to use and you can do a lot with in the app itself.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Time waste"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Far inferior to Capcut. To name a few pain points, the app is painfully slow in auto-caption processing, caption not syncing with the video, and worst of all, less-than mediocre free music library, where I always end up using Capcut to add music from their free and extensive selections. PD, you've been out in the market for decades longer than Capcut, but your app functions like it was just made.. Research your competitors and step up your game if you're serious about lasting in this business."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"After updating to the latest version, it has suddenly stopped working. Whenever I try to export a video, the processing stops midway. Oh! I have the premium version by the way. Not worth it."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The blur feature is missing in action somewhere. You guys keep moving stuff around. Creators are on the move and don't have time to look for something over and over again. Maybe stop focusing so much on the Ai that is ruining many apps and focus more on the basics that made the app one to enjoy using."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage yet again these stupid developers won't let me try the app before I buy it and they won't show the one time payment option which I assume would be $80-$100 then to top it off they offer a free trial which is a lie because I click the free trial then it says insufficient balance I'm gonna start filling complaints against the developers and have there apps removed from the playstore trying to make us buy something we know nothing about screw this app and every app like it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome video creating app!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly for my needs"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Thought it was great when I PAID for it years ago. Seriously stop moving the buttons and features around, every menu feels like a trap to go premium. I bought the app, I use the basic features I don't want all the premium nonsense that I will never use, and NOW you have started smearing advertisements along the sides of the screens when Im trying to work. Just so I'll accidentally click one?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"You don't need anything else. Terrific"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Please add real ai voice"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Most garbage video editor available"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I really respect what you do with power director. It is a small version of any big editing program and though it can get better I will always use and refer it to others."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I am an old user of power director. I like this app so much, but some days, it declines all my payment methods. I can't pay through phonepay or debit card."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Great for editing. One small issue is that this app doesn't support Android's Split Screen feature. I use my phone for a lot of other things and often multitask. Would appreciate if you solve this issue in the future."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Was working OK, until today when I'm adding text on the same bit it freezes and the text box stays where it is, always on the same bit, strange. There isn't many options regarding effects, but it's v the only one that worked on my tablet up till now. I'll have to send to myself in wattsap and edit elsewhere now."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"totally recommend best editing app apart from capcut"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be the best, now it's just an app from ppl who focus too much on the money and not on the product or customer. Used this for YEARS. Now it's ridiculously filled with bugs and so not user-friendly anymore. And when people report this same thing in the reviews, the programmers choose to gaslight you instead of simply accepting the fact that their greed ruined the app. And whoever they fired, needs to be rehired, because the current programmers are üëéüèø"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Feature set I find to be mostly positive. An easier to navigate sound track page would be nice. Biggest downside is the app routinely not recognizing my pro subscription. Even after following the guide it still does not recognize that I pay for the yearly subscription and have to routinely uninstall and reinstall the app. I am unlikely to renew if this problem persists"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Feel good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Stupid app requires payment before you can test out some important features! How the hell do you expect people to pay you before they can test it!

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Very bad. Even after purchasing pro version, unable to extract in 4k or generating auto captions on a long video. Android app crashes no. of times before getting even a small task done. Its has become a nightmare to use this app even on a 30K price smartphone. Spoken language of source does not have hindi option. It is a legging app. Not text to speech I'm complaining about main auto caption does not have hindi in spoken languages."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I wanted to test the video upscale, but it requires you to buy subscription or buty credit!! No thank you.. Uninstalling"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"When I open the app first time I saw the option of Different Templates in Auto Caption function but after when I purchased the paid version now its not showing the template option in auto caption"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"All you guys are doing is telling me how to cancel my subscription, which I've already done, what about my 13,500 naira you guys took again for the yearly subscription when it's not even up to 4 months after I had already paid for the yearly subscription. How are my going to recover it."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using PowerDirector for 8 years, 3 on premium. It hasn't been fun. It doesn't matter how fancy the tools or the AI gets; as it fails in doing even the simplest of tasks. When doing nearly anything with audio or video, it has a tendency to be off sync. This would be fine if it were consistent, but it's not. Audio cues are inconsistent through app reboots and where the playhead is. ""Professional Video Editing Software"" apparently gets trounced by Windows Movie Maker."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Issues with auto captions. I pay for premium account so I can edit videos on the go but the auto captions only works sometimes forcing me to use another app sometimes just to add the captions after spending time creating a video. Please fix and I'll change my rating. This affects me because it makes the identity of my channels looks mismatched"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Basic features work well on a Chromebook. But, the subscription gets you less and less while being prompted to purchase credits/add-ons. Everything is designed to extract more money from users. It cheapens the program and company. Reinforcing that you own nothing in the SaaS model you are just allowed to do what the company lets you to do for the right profit model. I think I'll use the rest of my subscription and cancel. I can get this treatment from Adobe or maybe I'll try a free software."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Super it was easy"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Per response: ‚Ä¢ a favorites function for transitions would be largely appreciated for ease in selecting along with a search bar. ‚Ä¢ fade in from black should be a standardized transition for the beginning/end of videos. Having to add an overlay or static picture and then transition is cumbersome and dated. ‚Ä¢ fading in/out with audio should be a function on its own to allow ease in starting or ending a video. The metric for measuring length should be seconds and on a slide bar for ease of use."

NOW, you put one in and it comes back to you nearly a GB worth of size? I took out a minute for Christ's sake, no edits, no effects, no audio added, no transitions, no whatever. Just a cut, and it doubles the size. Also, you can't move the timeline, at all. It breaks and you have to restart the app Powerdirector really has me going to Kine."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"You have impressed me of late of the key framing u added to the main track and the increase in the number of tracks u have provided the app. Kudos.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Most recent update caused an error, where my tool menu doesn't open, when selecting an item on the timeline. It's just one more button press, but considering how much I have to edit, for work, it's tedious to have to click the menu, everytime. Is there a fix for this?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Still on the free trial but I can say this has been one of the best apps out there, exactly what I was looking for. Didn't seem to be much to you can do without paying, haven't really explored everything yet as my main focus is the video editing as I was searching for which you can make ai art or find stock art to use for your videos which is neat, and no watermark logos!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The app wastes time with unnecessary conversion before editing. For the price, it should handle files smoothly. Even after converting Ultra HD to Full HD, the timeline lags, and clips move erratically, making editing frustrating. It doesn‚Äôt run well on my Honor 200 Pro. Export quality is worse than KineMaster, and there‚Äôs no fade-in or fade-out for clips. These flaws are unacceptable for a premium version and fail to meet expectations."

They advertise that if you pay for a subscription for full access then you can use the desktop and the mobile but it just isn't so. They offer no solutions. I suppose they take the money and run.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app. I had an error on my part, I simply closed out and refreshed the app. The only thing I have to say to improve on is the denoise feature. It used to be better in the older version of the app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"The application has several useful editing tools, that should be clarified, but the problem is that when I want to export a video, I get a notification that there has been an error, probably because there is something incompatible, but I have tried exporting the exact same video in another application, and there was no problem. Before the application did not cause anything like that, but now I don't know what happened."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good enough that I can do the kind of editing I want. Not a lot of effects to choose from. In particular not the same amount of effects like my other video editing app. However, this is the only other app I found that can load my files right away. I have 200k+ photos (excluding videos and other files) and most video editing apps takes a while for my files to load. Also, I like how the music files on my phoen are arranged alpabetically when pick out from my own music files."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Learning more of this everyday and loving it so much more than another commonly known app than can CAPture and CUT video. I do wish there were more dramatic in/out effects and question: Can you reverse a direction of an in/out effect on an image over lay? I figured out you can on video overlays by reverse video through tools but that option isn't there for image overlays? I am new to this so possible I'm just missing it.. Thank you!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Very good app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Using app for 5+ years with annual subscription but recently stopped. App gets worst with each update. Now to the point where you can not edit a video due to constant glitches. Freezes every few seconds. Exit out to restart & it does the same thing. The app now rotates, zooms, and randomly alters footage. Adds & removes audio . Video will be altered after upload ( adding footage that you haven't.) Perhaps the developers are trying to pack more than what can be handled into the app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best android video editor. Easy to use and work around with small to large project"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"It's a good app but so annoying with the adverts. Keeps trying to sell to you."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Look, B.... D Power Director.!."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the most awesome video production software on mobile phones. It allows dynamic editting, granting an enormously wide spectrum of utilities with an equally wider range of internal modifications. This permits sharp efficacy of target output, by giving the user complete control of production components, whilst authorizing imagined results, however intricate in preconception."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This is very good video editor for a simple user like me but still it needs to buy the pro version but this is ok for me."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Extremely perfect app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It helps with what I need. Thanks for doing what you can to make life better for me."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I've noticed this before and still notice it now. Every time I use the transition for the non overlay video,UI it looks like the first clip is fading into the next clip with a short freeze frame and then continues playing again. I tried to get over that issue with overlay vidros instead and noticed that when I press and hold to move the overlay on top of the other, the UI malfunctions. I've stopped using this because it causes me issues that irritates me and makes my edit look unpolished."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Not a big fan of the updates. Simply adding a picture to a video has become more complicated than it should be..lol ü§¶üèøü§¶üèøü§¶üèø....DELETING THIS APP"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless app. I would prefer capcut than this one. the forced powerdirector name at the bottom sucks big time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"More crashes than George Michael and fails to share videos to other apps occasionally. And please remove the advert with the retard in it"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Does not work in landscape mode on tablet. It simply shows the portrait version of the app in the centre of the screen with black bars on either side. You actually get less usable app space than if you turned it back to portrait. It's obviously only designed for smartphone usage."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Awful experience! Almost everything I want to do with the paid subscription is asking me for tokens to buy or actual money. A total scam. Be honest with your paying system from the very beginning. Non of your advertising suggests in-app purchases,and you charge 40 bucks for what many other apps do for free. Total scam!!! I cancelled it immediately."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. there is no watermark removal option."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Many options, works well, needs custom resolution. I'm giffing and need to have 540 max width, only a few options for resolution that I could find? Tons of other stuff I'll likely never use though! I've been using this company software for decades. Works very well to sharpen and define video, high quality results."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for 5+ years. Never had an issue with it. I've done some really professional projects with it in the past. Unfortunately, after I write this review, I will be canceling my subscription. When did this ""once great app"" turn to garbage. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Too glitchy. It's so frustrating. I loved this app. Sorry, Power Director... you've lost a loyal subscriber. I truly hope that the person or people who ruined this app lost their jobs. üëé"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Powerful editing app loved it but the main problem is its laggy"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"VIP vip video üì∏ and photo maker"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Another bait & switch where you waste time learning the edit, and no one can see it without the very reasonable extortion price of $34.99 Not saveble, nor uploadable without paying."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Was under the impression that it can be used free. When I tried to use it, had to pay. That's just heart breaking. Uninstalled"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This is the best video-making app in the world, and I absolutely love it! I've been using it for a month now to create videos, and it's super easy to use. I initially gave it 4 stars, but I really wanted to give it 5. However, there‚Äôs a small issue‚Äîdownloading videos is very slow. Please fix this issue, and I‚Äôll happily give it 5 stars.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Awful. Ads only got more predatory as years went on, from pop-ups to unskippable 20-seconds-long commercials, and the problem of random audio popping still occurs multiple devices later."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"From what I can see, there's still no motion tracking for Android, It's been on IOS for a few years now. What's making it so challenging to bring it across?"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"They are constantly charging me for a subscription that I took for only one month. Why do you even keep the 1 month option. Simply state that there is no one month subscription. And that if you choose the 1 month subscription we will keep charging every month discreetly. This is the hallmark of a company that wants to make a quick buck out of unsuspecting users. SHAME ON YOU FOR USING CHEAP TRICKS JUST YO MAKE SOME MONEY"

I have a Google Pixel 8 Pro (512 GB model) I literally produce videos entirely from my phone, I'm a YouTuber."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Took forever to export and 'produce' a 1 and a half minute video. Got stuck on 90% and never completed. Will use something better."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Good for new editors in this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I almost loved it! I needed it to change the background of a video. Unfortunately, that's a premium feature that costs a premium price.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"

There may be some issues independently but on a relative basis, the app does things that no other relevant apps does. Everybody should try this app. It's so much nice.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"When you edit a video sounds that you add to the video. And you create pinpoints to make the sound go up and down. It seems if you do too many and start to erase them. You get errors. 1# is you can't delete all the pins that you put in for making the sound go up and down. You can't delete all of them. 2# is once you've gotten the sound lowered from a previous sound you had before and it plays through properly through the preview but when you export it the video It plays louder than previewed."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Does not respect privacy. Asked during install to allow notifications, but does NOT state that the notifications include Cyberlink adverts. Unlawful in the UK to advertise without consent. No way in the app to turn off notifications. Also unlawful. Not a big deal but loses 4 stars for lack of trust. EDIT after cyberlink reply - Google dev policy says you must provide an ability in the app to disable push notifications. To link me to google settings is again untrustworthy."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Price too high (monthly)for mobile video editing. Only option is auto renewal. Oversimplified interface, but conversely too many selections that slow down workflow. It's fine to ask money for your software, it's entirely another thing to force people into subscription services - if it came with cloud storage that might be worthwhile."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"So I purchased the full package on my laptop and have downloaded all the apps. For some reason this is the only app on my Android and it doesn't even allow me to login. Just found out they already know, but don't make a clearly visible mention in the desktop purchase. So each version needs their own subscription. That's freaking ridiculous and greedy! Besides that the app version acces to drive is blocked by Google which makes it even more useless!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I never leave reviews but I have to for this one because like honestly I have to say I love Power Director!! I've tried quite a few other video editing apps and for free you will not be able to beat PowerDirector!! like other free apps end up either not having all the features or you have to pay for an expensive membership to get anything close to what you get on this app so I would recommend this to everybody if you want the very top of the line editing with the free version!!!"

I try to edit & it is black. I make a copy& whole project is blacked out. All captions, cuts, transitions all gone. File is corrupted and unusable after hours of editing. Can not upload to the cloud. Google blocks the app as being a threat. Also love to save my standard filter, transitions as a template. Iove this app. Used it for the last years daily."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps freezing clip halfway through"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This is literally the best music adder for videos you can possibly get! I mean yeah sure they slap on a watermark to your videos, but it's out of the way of videogame UI, which makes it pretty easy to remove with watermark eraser apps.

But the biggest disappointment is the AI. It's just not good! And what's even worse, they reduced the daily rewards from 5 credits to 3, and your daily credits are only valid for 7 days! The smallest video you can make is 40 credits for 10 seconds. So now I can't use those redits unless I purchase more! I'm not renewing my subscription for this reason!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"The overall interface is nice and mostly intuitive, but the end results were unusable for me. It took my 110MB video captured from OBS and somehow inflated it to over 800MB. I only removed over 5m of content! The inflated size means I can't really share it with anyone. Even if I cranked it down considerably on the export settings, it was still over 500MB. It also applies a watermark to output. I was willing to live with it if the above issues didn't exist, but I wish they were upfront about it."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome application, using since 5 years..."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Great video editor overall, but I give it 3* because of two great inconveniences: 1. Rotation of a clip using double finger swiping isn‚Ä≤t precise at all. 0¬∞ doesn't indicate a completely level clip. You don‚Ä≤t get any haptic feedback when you reach a level point. 2. No haptic or visual feedback when resizing a clip to fit the canvas. I‚Ä≤ll adjust the rating if the developers acknowledge my issues."

Asked the customer support they suggest a lot of different things. Nothing changed. The UX is slow, even with all the render settings put on lowest. Videos sometimes have freezes AFTER exporting. Then issues just arise from there and was unable to get a refund even though the app is now essentially useless to me as the issues have got worse and worse. Up to date OS, app, etc."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Whatever update, yall just made 10/15 Now the transform button to pan does not work and is the main editing tool I use. I pay annually & now I want a refund because now I need a new software. Do not change things, you break things. UPDATE I did what the developer said Transform button still broke. When u hit it it won't show you the scene you are on, it keeps showing first scene and last. What took a minute now takes hours to edit"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I am unable to hear original clip audio while I'm attempting to record a voice over. I used an earlier version of this app years ago on a different device and on a laptop and was able to hear original clip audio while recording voice overs. Why has that ability been removed? Is there a way to unmute original audio while recording voice overs? If so, please tell me how. If not, please add it back!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"BROKEN FOR MONTHS, a very very expensive application for one that doesn't work anymore. Stuck at X% when trying to produce high resolution video."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"So many bug can't even Edit 5 video. My video always corrupted. But when comes to money they always force you to buy it pro version. 1 star to this application this year. I will edit review to 1 star at my other account very disappointed"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing or just won't run. I downloaded this and the first short simple project it has had to be closed and reopened several times and no it won't play more than the first 1 second of video and audio. Terrible first impression."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Your app is plain and simple garbage str8 up..it malfunctions and seperates all of myy stems for no apparent reason. Like why am i paying for something that doesn't even function properly? keeps quitting(multiple phones). I dont even know how how these guys give you good reviews. I am trying to work on important projects and it keeps messing everything up."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Is there another update happening? Trying to increase or reduce the speed of videos/photos is now extremely difficult, because with the latest change, we can no longer see how far the video or photo extends or retracts UNTIL we have adjusted the speed within the speed section, exited the speed section and navigated back to the timeline. Very frustrating. Hopefully this is just a part of an update on progress?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I have to change my review yet again. I've paid for this app to be a pro member. But every time I turn around I'm being asked to spend more money. Even though I'm a pro member. They went from you can buy it to subscription now credits. What is the point of buying the app if you're going to keep charging me. It's sad too cuz I like the app. But how many times do I have to pay for an app before I can actually use all the functions"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I think this is a solid app for content creation if all you have is a phone. You can do some basic stuff with the free version, but I would recommend going premium and having all the stuff the app lets you have with the premium version."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app for editing without a doubt and for many reasons."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Could be a great app, but It gets buggy and has flaws. I've worked on editing together a hour and a half long video twice now because everytime I finalize the video the app destroys my audio quality to the point it's robotic and unusable in a very specific spot. I tried remaking the video and checked the original video sound quality, it's flawless every step of the way until I finalize the video and the app destroys the audio quality. I've wasted hours on this app now, I cannot recommend it."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"good app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app for video editing I can do a lot. I wish it was easier to work with making animations too."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This is a very bad app. I paid 2000 for a year subscription and now I can't edit and produce a single video properly.Every time editing shows error and when producing again error.. No one should download this app again.No one should take subscription even if it is done now. Despite emailing several times, no reply has been given,100% sure this is a useless app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Little things like being able to edit clips more precisely would be cool but also I've used this program forever and I really can't find a reason to use anything else."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I love this app - easy to uninstall. Money hungry app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Very glitchy controls. I have a brand new pixel pro so it's definitely not my phone. Frustrating to edit and save videos because the app will randomly erase half your work and not let you undo it with the undo button. Very disappointing, especially after you spend hours editing a video."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Hi. I would like to say, that I love the App. BUT, I do hope your team could fix some bugs in the app that happened after this recent update of yours. The ""Canvas"" or Blurred Background isn't that efficient as before. Also, some of the Voice Audio that I put in seem to break or becomes choppy at some point. It always happens. Regarding the ""SPEED"" feature, it seems NOT TO BE USER FRIENDLY. The old navigation was better. In other words, the App itself was better compared to the recent Update."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I'm really liking it so far. Easy to use and I can upload sermons without needing to pay."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"very easy to use 2019 I notice I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it because it will have the PowerDirector badge on my video and I have a paid subscription to remove that.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Ever since this recent updates I cannot access my Google drive it keeps saying that the app stopped working"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm not a video person, and this app is very easy to use and very functional without getting the premium. If I keep making videos I'll get the premium. Lots of interesting tools, that you can use a few times for free. It doesn't appear as if they're trying to bilk anyone. Totally worth checking out."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I purchased the full version of this app, along with transitions, popups, slides, and stickers which are paid separately. Now, they‚Äôre asking me to pay for a subscription! This is unfair and feels like a cash grab. I already paid for the features‚Äîwhy should I have to pay again?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"2016 ""Pretty good but doesn't seem to upload to Facebook and no fade out or fade in that I can see?"" 2017 I bought a lifetime purchase, but then the app went full subscription and I couldn't use it! Never returned. Update 2014-10 while I had attempted restoring purchase previously it was never successful but tried again after response from dev yesterday. While the steps didn't exactly match the app does appear to have restored. Not to 'Pro' but ateast to something that works. Thank you."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Hello team power director. I have been finding it very difficult to update power director app on play store. Pls help fix the issue or give suggestion of what i will do to update power director app. Waiting for ur reply. Thanks"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"For an android app it's actually quite extensive in it's features and very user friendly"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Quick fix most appreciated and thanks for the tip. Will keep it in mind. The app is back to good operation. Trans buttons restored. Good change on the speed adjustment. Looking fwd to exploring new options. Thanks for the quick repairs. In the midst of editing as usual."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Enjoy this app, easy to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Does not fully support 4:3 aspect ratio. If you import a clip in 4:3, it will add horizontal black bars so it can export in 1:1. Deal breaker for me, as this is my favorite format for mountain biking videos."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Watermark Really?! Your competitors are doing better and there a lot of options missing like to make your own aspect ratio thats basic for a video editor!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Another update: So like everyone has said these last updates are horrible. I've used this app for years and just like others have said, once your video gets to around 10mins, everything gets pretty glitchy. Also this is something that's never happened before, I've exported my 18min long video, and at certain parts there's these red and blue lines everywhere. Almost like the green lines on ""focus peaking"". I've tried multiple times and always happens. Can't use that video at all now.Waste of time"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"how does CapCut do better than this? literally, I got a Watermark, and CapCut got their own watermark at the end of that video. and I can remove it without premium. the editing system is good, but this is why I'm giving it 4 stars. (I take it back after so many months)"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not working."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for video editing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashing all the time. Updates suck. You change things all the time and not for the better. Never. NEVER change established button names and locations. It's like changing the a and b buttons on a Nintendo. Customer support is nonexistent. So yeah 1 star."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome app can't complain. Such a shame though they don't yet have the updated IOS version for androids with, the track object template. Overall great app for my edits and voice overs."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It works great!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"üôè"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Oh yea.~"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I have a subscription for the windows version, I've got to pay a second time for the Android version, CyberLink, tell me this is incorrect, I can't believe you'd charge twice to the same consumer."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This is trash app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I would like to reach someone about a refund on the premium subscription. My app keeps crashing and I can't edit anything smoothly. Thanks."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this tool for 2years for free"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Very buggy, came back to my projects after a recent update and it's cooked. The text is bumping out my pictures, it won't even open google drive to download any of my film now, just keeps going back to the original project. I really wanted to like this app, as I enjoy the graphic stickers and effects, but I can't even use my latest project. I'll be looking for an alternate app that is much more reliable. I wouldn't recommend paying for premium."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Downloaded it just so I could unblur a video sent from iPhone to android. The ""pro"" features supposedly were great and did nothing to the resolution of my video."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is really good amazing effects all is good üëè, but not working voice changer, what's the problem üòï"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"App crashes when you apply any of the voice mods, it likes to cover the screen with blue occasionally when you move clips, auto-captions doesn't work anymore as it stops 30% of the way, ai beat effects are gone and when they were around they barely worked, constantly crashes under the slightest pressure (Galaxy S22 Ultra. She runs fine. This app does not.) and has to restore ""broken projects"" after every crash, etc. Thankfully having to hit ""extract audio"" isn't necessary anymore!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Its so laggy and a project breaks in like 1 second.The only perk, is that it give you free pro for some time if you log in."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The app was running just fine, until voice effects kept on breaking the app. Every time I put on voice effects on either a video or audio, it either kicks me out of the project or closes the app entirely. This should really get fixed CyberCorp, cause right now, this is a mess."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's still good but has been kicking me out of the app and back the main screen when I open some projects."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb app"

Edit : 21/10/23 reduce rate 3->2, more bugs after update again and force out many times, very annoying... Update : 12/10/24 reduce rate 2->1 worst app that I found, major bugs after update force to quit app cannot do anything. And everytime that send the feedback -> please clear cache..."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this ap for a few years. Now, it won't upload videos from my phone or sd card. I've tried deleting the cache and even reinstalling the app. When I click on the video from my camera folder, the time stamp resets to zero and won't upload."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing. For an amateur like me, this app does wonders."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good experience"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using PowerDirector for 5 years in my pc. It allows to edit videos perfectly in low-end pc. I have core-i3 four gen processor without graphics card. But it runs very well. This time I tried mobile version. Though some features are not available in mobile version, but it has enough tools to edit your videos. But in this version I'm facing a problem. In portrait mode when I try to add music, I can't find music option in the add panel. Please fix it. And can I use pc subscription?"

I'm sorry but everything nowadays going into subscription and I'm done with it, can we not just get why we buy anymore? It already had monetization options on top of buying pro before."

And for some reason it ""doesn't support my media"", the same media I've been using for 3 years. My guess is this because of new updates, because it was never like this before."

I have to use two separate editors now because of this new update. Until it's fixed I'll just have to look around for a better video editor. The audio part. It was convenient when I could drop a video and just slide that video down to the audio section. Now i have to download a mp3 video audio and it's more of an inconvenience than anything."

They want $30+ for a year, when others you can purchase forever for umder $20. If you had a lifetime purchase around the $20 range maybe even $30 I would be more interested, but the trial and ease of use is good overall."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Poor tutorials and customer support. There is no introductory tutorial for the latest app version. In fact, the learning facility is haphazard, to say the least. Customer support ignores my questions and provides robotic responses. They just said sorry and closed my feedback ticket!

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's the greatest app and all, but in my belief I believe their should be a pausing some sort of feature for premium subscribers that allow you to put the video split or ""cut"" to go at the same time as the audio. So it plays as a surprise. Thank you if you see this, and thanks to the developers."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Stabilizer costs money... lame"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Any time you create a video longer than 5 minutes or so, the clips get so glitchy, and the audio no longer matches the video. You can fix that if your clips are shorter than 10 seconds maybe by ""converting to better performance"" but anything longer than 20 seconds and it endlessly loads. App is good for some stuff, but it's so unbearably glitchy. This issue has never seemed to be fixed."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's good, really‚Ä¶ near perfect‚Ä¶ My sole complaint is that I REALLY don't like my colorful text templates being constantly disorganized when updates happen and they get moved around‚Ä¶ could there possibly be an update that (just like with the desktop version) let's us favorite the text templates used so that they're accessible in a separate part?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Good üëç Aap"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Once again ruining the app when there was nothing wrong with it. I can't edit anything dealing with text now since you decided it would be a good idea to move the edit portion to the side of the screen instead of it coming up from the bottom. Go back that version instead. This one is just stupid. Are you trying to lose customers?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It's free"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Power director is NOT working well on Samsung S20 series and above. You CANNOT video to audio after the latest update"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's a pretty simple editor for free with the ability to expand with options offering higher convenience, quality, and creativity. Since I'm only just learning editing, this suits me just fine"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This is so frustrating to use I had this app a while ago and was able to select more than one photo at a time and now I have to keep going back and forth to get all the pictures I want instead of collecting all of them at once so annoying"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Simple, powerful and easy"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this apps because it's so helpful ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Usually a great app. Unfortunately, lately, with each update, it becomes more unstable with freezing and hanging. And that's even after clearing the cache AND reinstalling. üòï Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for editing vids"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"This New Update is UNACCEPTABLE! Because I Can't Extract Audio From A Video File Anymore It Keeps Showing Track Not Supported. Now I Have To Use Another App To Convert A Video File To MP3 But I Can't Afford To Keep Doing That Until Y'all Fix The Problem. This Used To Be A Great App But It's Ruined By Adding Bunch Of Garbage That I Don't Even Want. FIX POWER DIRECTOR!! üò°üò°üò°"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Why when I dragged my video from video timeline to the audio track, it now says ""Audio is not supported"". When you used to drag a video down to audio track, it used to convert to audio. Why you guys messed this functionally?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"For some reason, when I play a clip it freezes, I obviously hated it, next time Im done editing I wish you fix it but you cannot fix it, what a poopy product."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Very useless, slow app! Nothing works. Just a waste of data and space! 0 star!! Useless app. I'm so mad at myself for even downloading this nonsense excuse of an app! MOST OF THE FEATURES DON'T WORK!! If ""useless"" was an app, it would be PowerDirector - Video editor!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"This app gets worse with each new update and each time they update it, it hinders my ability to make videos for YouTube. Now it's to the point where I can't even use recordings to be put into audio slots. Stop updating the app, it was fine 6 years ago, now it's becoming unbearable to use it"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The new update isn't allowing my app to read .mp4 files anymore. May try to re-download the app and see if that works."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"A glitchy mess. I have been paying for power director premium since March 2022 and I haveade over 100 vlogs with it. Constantly glitches out while editing. During an hour long video edit I have to reset the app at least 6 times. It's gotten more unreliable over the years as they added more features. I only use it as they have royalty free music, well only some if it is as I constantly get flagged on YouTube for copyright issues and have to change songs."

It is also extremely lagy and glitchy while trying to navigate and trying to play the video, which was never an issue previously. Used to love it, now considering canceling"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"A nice app. The only thing that I miss in the app is 2k or at least 2.7k format to store the video in."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"A very user friendly interface and the app is packed with useful functions and tools to give you the best results every single time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I'm sure this app is good if payed for, but with some of the basics behind a pay wall, and the trial only kicking in with confirming a subscription, I can't confirm if it would work for me without first paying (key frames and transparency are not free, and there's no suggestion they exist even when paying) My only advice to the developer would be make the trial free without sign up, so people at least have a chance to see if they want the pro features, instead of putting them off with pricing!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been looking for a new editor app to change my style of editing, but this one doesn't even provide anything new compared to my previous FREE editor app. About 3/4 of the stuff in here requires you to pay for premium, and it doesn't even 4k for free. So nah, I'm good."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"It was better before, now it is a little too complicated. I understand some may like the new overlays, but please add an easier way to add fade in from black (or any color) and fade out to black or any any color. It worked fine before when it had this feature, readd that feature and my rating would improve."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Hi I am trying to edit a video with this app But everytime I try to edit with a YouTube video audio it stays perfectly fine for a couple of minutes and when I get close to finishing it The audio of the video goes silent and starts glitching and it says that there's a decode error and I can't edit the video Please fix this"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice üëç"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this to edit my videos for years now and even with just the free version it's pretty handy, but now all of a sudden it has decoding errors almost instantly trying to produce videos containing files with audio and video formats I've literally used hundreds of times without a problem. Videos that are only 8 seconds long and are 720p resolution with a frame rate of 30 fps. If the problem is that all of the new updates made my phone non-compatible, then I guess I'm uninstalling."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Well it didn't go great at all for my 1st try at this app .... All I wanted to do was add a simple text box to my video & I couldn't do that. Reasoning was after adding the text bubble which I had 3 I think to choose from w/o paying for one & the text was so incredibly tiny just cuz the spacing between the actual text & where the bubble is was so large that it left a tiny amt of room for the text to b & there is no editable character spacing avail to change that so it's completely unusable. Sry"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Pro subscriber for years. They ruined PD. Since all of the AI updates which I don't use, basic functionality is compromised. Now whole app stutters, lags & crashes often. Cache clear & closing background apps doesn't help. Days worth of work ruined trying to apply a suggested lag fix method. It ignored pins, kicked multiple layer sections past the orig timeline & inexplicably snarled everything, leaving my 5 min length project a mess. The undo option wouldn't undo, there is a huge bug with it."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"4k videos donot support well. Please fix this"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be my most reliable editor. 4 or 5 months ago it started glitching with the way that it cropped my videos. after a month of complaints it was finally fixed. but now the auto captions no longer works. This app is becoming as unreliable as it was reliable. üò¢"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Dear power director team Whatever feature is inside transition that feature should also be in overlay"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is capable of doing decent work, but the absolute INSANE cost cost for upscaling video footage is beyond greedy. It cost 7 dollars a month to subscribe to the pro version, and that 7 dollars gets you literally only 100 seconds worth of video upscaling. Upscaling cost 1 coin per second of video, and the cost coins beyond the monthy 100 given for the pro subscription is almost 20, TWENTY!! dollars per 100 coins. That's almost 1 DOLLAR EVERY 5 SECONDS to upscale a video. What a scam"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Zabardast"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"PowerDirector's subscription plan isn't worthwhile. The majority of useful features are only available in the pricier Pro version. There are limited features and issues exporting content. Additionally, the recent increase in monthly subscription prices has further worsened the situation. I cannot recommend this app based on these factors."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Not completely reliable. Sometimes if the editing session is too long the app starts acting up and sometimes it doesn't save right. One time I spent like a couple of hours editing, saved it, came back to it and the clips and audios were all misaligned."

While not surprised, I wouldn't want people thinking I'm an ""AI bro"" because I happen to use an editing program that has AI features even if I don't use the AI features. It also seems to me that that's the main thing they focus on. How am I supposed to deal with this and prove that my editing is idk 100% human work? I'm sorry but I'll have to get a different video editor."

Zero customer support, files disappear, project files unable to reinstate, constant updates that do nothing but cost more memory, Constantly has to be restarted as if will stop saving work if you leave the screen. It's sad because the editor itself is decent."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good! It was simple for me to understand after a little toggling. It's pretty generous with rewards (like free trials for premium, and even though there are a lot of feautures, it helps you understand how to get the most out of them. The free version can be frustrating, though. And to me, the premium version isn't worth the price. It is currently $7/month (or $35/year), but that's a lot of money for an app, especially if you don't use it all the time."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I suffered years of problems with this app. Disappearing projects etc. They do seem to have eventually addressed some of the issues. I make fewer videos than I used to but it does seem better. Bizarrely, they have ""AI"" features which aren't actually AI, just filters. Old filters too. eg Chipmunk voice filter. Either Cyberlink don't know what AI is, or, they think PowerDirector users don't know what AI is. Maybe I don't know what AI is. I know what it isn't though... A chipmunk voice filter!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Heavy advertising for subscriptions.

Also, I change one minor thing in my video and then I have to spend the next hour resorting entire video. Won't keep sounds/effects where I put them. Glitches out loads. App is a huge time waster."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Quite a good option for a free video editor, this was my first software and it has really nice mobile controls. Good performance, not too much lag, and the free content is really high quality. The free music library sounds really good, the free transitions are nice, and overall this is a really good beginners editing software. I highly recommend this app for people who just want to make some ok videos quickly, but for professional use, things on PC like filmora, premiere or PD for PC is better."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"One of the best user-friendly mobile video editing apps on the market. I HONESTLY can't believe how many amazing pro features, including Ai options, that Power Director has to offer. I hardly ever use my laptop software to edit anymore. If you have a powerful and fast enough phone (like Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra), the editing options on the PD app can do almost anything. The only thing I wish they had more sound and music altering features like pitch, tone, echo, and a better reverb option."

Really hate the subscription nonsense. I'll gladly pay for an upgrade, but I will not pay monthly or yearly for something I bought and have the drivers for my computer. Not to mention features that use to be free i now have to pay for. I've been using this for 4-5 years. Finally upgraded only to be really annoyed that it's all subscription based."

It's now 7-11-2024."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using PowerDirector for 6 years, and the paid one since 2020. Here's some simple changes to surpass CapCut. Make the workflow FASTER. Put the cut and delete buttons in thumb's reach outside the tools selection bar (like in 2019). Make auto-align a setting you can turn off (for both timeline and screen objects). Get rid of the ""AI Video Effects"" features cause its taking up space in the software and doesn't work. Take all the essential editing functions and put those first in the tools."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Excellent video editing app, The one thing I like is the ability to expand the height of all the video tracks, to view the timeline in a more PC like mode, however it is not possible to add transitions between clips on the overlay tracks/layers which makes them pointless to me."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"This app is has a bug cause when I insert the video and the sound I download the music I insert is gone I confused and in mad I worked so hard to edit a video and then it just disappears"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Lost way too much time for this piece of... hickups everywhere, it can be used only to put together trimmed short edits, nothing more. Supplied intros/outros are garbage. Creating your own limited to the limit. Overall - waste of time. There is a reason why everybody treating media seriously get a laptop, and put things together there. These are toys, worse than toys. They take your TIME, and leave you in worse place than you were before you started! Don't WASTE your time!(editor and film maker)"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"AMAZING"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"After purchasing the full version you are given bare bones options and everything else is behind a subscription pay wall. It wouldn't be so bad if these extra features were something special, but all it is, is the advanced options locked behind a pay wall and you get a bare bones experience minus a watermark for paying. I'm very disappointed, I actually enjoy the editor it's just unfortunate that half or more of the features are behind a pay wall that's behind another pay wall."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I make all my videos in here, love it! Easy and very fast."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It's the best video editor on android. Would be even better if text boxes were dynamic and the line length could be adjusted by reshaping the box rather than having to go back to edit and format manually."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The problem with synchronizing video and audio tracks is not fixed from version to version. I have already changed 3 phones and this problem is still not solved. It's playing good while editing but after export there is delay around 10-15 ms between audio and video tracks!

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Hello, I have a very big issue with the bill that charged me $52.63. I have never subscribed for anything with Power Director. I only used stuff that was explicitly advertised as free. I would like my money back and cancel that subscription for which I have never asked in the first place, please! Thanks for your help."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for my YouTube channel ever since 2021. And it was great! No crashing or anything. But now, after I do all that editing and stuff, and once I try to produce it, it only goes up to 6% and then the app goes straight back to it's home screen without even saving. And this is the only good editing app I know. So I can't even post any videos to YouTube anymore without editing it. But please fix this. I don't wanna stop making YouTube videos. But I'm nice, so I give 2 stars."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Needs improvement but for an app on your phone it's very good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It doesn't have the sounds I need"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Edited on July 3 2024 I went back on 3 stars because It used to be my favorite until last week when I couldn't export my videos on time and sometimes end up losing the project. When exporting, the progress always stops somewhere between 69%and 73% forever. The worst part is that you must stay in the foreground until the download is completed . Developers please look into this problem"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"ü§©ü§©ü§©"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm all set."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"The app is pretty decent and does quite a few things. What I really detest is the price model structure. I think it is very unfair for companies to charge subscriptions for programs that they should charge a price one time for (i.e., a singular charge to own the software). I'd gladly pay even $20 to own the app indefinitely. NEVER would I pay for a subscription! Hopefully, CyberLink SmartensUp."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this editing app since 2021 and in my opinion this best editing app because this editing app have all features you need in editing and latest update was just Boom here is more new features like anime video so according to me this is best editing app"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I'm very disappointed in the customer service of this app. Last week I paid for a 30 second conversion of my video to AI video, but the converted video wasn't produced. I've been trying to get a refund ever since, and so far I haven't received it. So I have no finished product, and they have not refunded me. Not very professional. Update: I finally received the end product, thnx. Wished I could give 5 stars, because the app has a lot of good features. Unfortunately support was very frustrating."

Power Director is a easy to understand, free editing app with minimal adds! I love it! It has all the tools I need for editing my videos at no cost, and the premium tools are even better! It's a must have for all mobile video editors!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"So many features! Best video production app for mobile ;)"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this program for 6 years. It takes some getting used to but the basic functions are VERY beginner friendly. It's pretty legit and worth the price! Constantly updating and adding things as well, which is very nice from a consumer side to get more for your $!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"When the app chooses to work properly, Its great. However it's clear the developers don't fix any bugs with the app, so it has become hard to use. It's super glitchy and sometimes you have to tap an icon multiple times to get it to open. Sometimes the app itself refuses to open and you have to tap ot multiple times to get it to open. I would have rated it 5 a few months ago, but I guess the developers abandoned the app."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love power director. Awesome app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Already want refund. I needed background noise removal. They brag on the most powerful background removal tool. Also claim no file size limits. background noise removal limited to videos under 10 minutes? So many editors have silly ridiculous tools I'll never use, but keeping it simple stupid and basic... not capable...sigh... I'm tried jumping hoops for basic editing. I cut and removed that way, still background noise!! Terrible product."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I was relatively new into the video experience. As my skills develop I find Power Director Mobile continues to enhance my creativity. Their updates and added features are awesome. They are easy to understand and use. The quarterly cost is very reasonable in my opinion. I have no reason to look for other applications. Power Director continues to provide what I need!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you So Much Great Work Easy to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"First time ever leaving a 1 star for an app. I subscribed and paid for extra features and I spent 4 hours making a video just to have it save on my phone, something glitched within the PowerDirector system and messed up all the time I put into my video. So all that time I spent on making my video was for nothing. I am very unhappy about this situation and asked for a refund."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Works üí™"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"*IMPORTANT UPDATE* The reply made by the developer to this comment further proves my point! The link provided took me to a random telegram group about stock trading and when I tried to follow the rest of the instructions provided they did not honour their 30 day refund policy. Developer's refused me a refund when my child mistakenly purchased the app so clearly they need to rely on stealing people's money rather than counting on their product to generate revenue. AVOID THIS APP!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This is the best one out there. Easy to navigate and use."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very useful app and Easy to Hadle Thank you üòä"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"When the app is good, it works well. Unfortunately, it lags a lot and I often have to restart the app to get it working again. The app has a good amount of features and is intuitive enough but that almost doesn't mean anything if I can't use the app for more than a few edits before the app freezes and I need to restart it."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I'm changing my rating to a 4 since I got a response and was given some advice, along with them acknowledging my exact issues. Thank you for the help, and I hope I can have a better experience onwards. I look forward to continuous improvements."

Its great to be able to do a quick edit out in the feild. Update. January 2023 Still lovin it ***EDIT*** JULY 5TH 2023 Still love it ."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"App sucks sack you don't include correct cropping you don't include time snap you can't even see the time bar correctly"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"At first, I really liked this app, but it's getting frustrating. It's buggy after about 10 minutes. It freezes, moves stuff around into places where I did not put them, & takes too long to open. It's still the only one I use because I'm used to it & paid for the added stuff, but this app is good for about 3 stars, at best."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Hmm, the nice sound tracks from old version was already gone. üòîüòîüòî"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Still has the stupid blue circle in the timeline, still messing around with the timeline and how it functions is basically worse, all the fancy AI garbage is irritating, too much emphasis on some gif animation has made the text almost unreadable it's so small and now to top it off... The simple yet highly useful REVERSE CLIP is no longer there!!! If you wish to pander to attracting the TICTOK users then make a dedicated app... Now going to use old phone, old app and do what this cannot do!!!"

Used this app as a premium member for years but today all of a sudden I'm getting an error ""power director mobile encountered an error decoding video"" when trying to upload/export my video I spent days editing. And all my text animations stopped working also. I had to change them to one that did an animation."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent for throwing together a great video on the fly. Very functional. The AI side costs extra. I'm happy with it so farüòä"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Powerdirector is best opportunity to setify your situations video editing to how much"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I had paid for the full version years ago to have access to extra features and to remove the watermark. However after they switched to subscriptions they removed features that I had already paid for! They placed features behind a subscription pay wall despite the fact they used to either be free or part of the full version I had purchased. That is very scummy. It also glitches more often. I'll still use the app since its still very easy to use but im disappointed in what they did."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I think the crashing has stopped. It's better. I'm uncomfortable with all the AI tools because they are so unreliable currently, and I don't have any need of them."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute POS. You can't even trim a video. You can only trim it from one side but not the other. What is the problem it should just be a bar that you can slide from one side to the other but you only have one side showing. What in the world are you thinking"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It's become better. More dependable. Been using it for years."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Power director is one of great video edit app"

Will be using an alt and not renewing this. If you attempt to make subtitles bigger you need to ADJUST EVERY SINGLE LINE MANUALLY OR THEYLL BE OFF SCREEN. God forbid they stay in screen without needing to manually edit every single line of dialogue in an entite video. The deleting my work was the last straw.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be one of the better video editing apps, but it has gone downhill so far that it's not even funny.

Since face blur is necessary especially for those countries requiring it for privacy, and the video is a bit laggy in the app. I really hope you can consider this suggestion, so it would be convenient for people who are required to blur faces in their country for privacy, and so the video layout will be good.

Once I exited the paywall I went to start a new project and tried to import videos recorded from my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra in its default video format. The app said the video format is not supported which is mp4 by the way so the fact that it doesn't support mp4 is unbelievable. Immediately deleted the app and wrote this review. Avoid if you really want to use a good video editing app."

I've never used, but they have PowerDirector 360 for PC, and apparently it is more robust than the mobile version. Thank you to whoever the creators are!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"3rd review. I Want My Money Back! When I looked under Play store, this app came up for video compression which it doesn't have. I bought the app and posted a review that said I wanted my money returned. The link that PowerDirector sent me and the directions were so confusing. Send a URL that sends me to the correct place with directions that are written in layperson writing. Make the directions very clear. Step by step, with very clear directions. Terrible customer service."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid for the full version years ago. I was loyal to this app and now you still want me to pay a subscription on top of this despite the one time fee I paid a long time ago. Even if I still didn't have the newer premium features, this should have still worked for the watermark. I'm uninstalling this editor!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Paywall up front. Useless for me. I had searched Google for a photo app that could remove glare. This was highly recommended. Alas, it's a video editor. You can select a photo, but the app interprets it as a short clip. No tool to remove glare. Since there's no free trial, I paid to find out it could not perform the task! Has gaudy effects you can add."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for several years to make real estate videos. I like it for the most part. The available music isn't great anymore, it's harder to find something instrumental that's good. Some of the effects, graphics etc feel dated. Overall it's easy to use and has served me well. I would recommend."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"very useful. Highly recommended"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"not really good for editing that much, can't remove the water mark(cuz I need to pay I do understand that), too complicated to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good but being ridiculous with me lately. It shows the video percentage when producing, it goes from 0 to 4 then backwards repeatedly. It then gives me multiple options of how to fix the issue. But none of the options are my problem. Because I've been making videos using this specific device for a long time now. This app needs fixes or something because I pay for the service and I can't even use it as of recently. It's annoying and frustrating."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"dude I have a Samsung AO3 core with not enough storage. Because of that, this app is always glitching it's things I put on it. And the ads.. they literally pop up on the app every time I exit editing a video and the sound effects are only for premium and there is no way I can save the videos with sound effects unless I get free sound effects Wich may lead to lining up their pockets just because of advertisments. Oh, one more thing, not even one sound effect don't make any sense. That was I call-"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"It seems that a lot of the transitions are gone. The glitch and film roll in particular were available a day ago and now they're gone."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I don't know how this app is usable. Every time I tried saving the video, It would crash, and even after this newest update, the editor would kick me to the main menu, making me lose my progress, and the AI can't distinguish between a person and a rock. I'll be looking for a different app. Not worth the time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Just a five star experience so far. And I'm using a free version. Very convenient, fast. And intuitively simple."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"As a complete newbie to video editing and content creation, I'm pleasantly surprised at the ease of using this app. Apart from a few minor edits where I needed to Google a how to, I've been able to work through the different options pretty easily. An awesome thing for me, someone who was overwhelmed by the idea of video editing. This app makes most basic work easy and the end result is a surprisingly well put together final product. Using for IG and YT. Well with the $8.99 for the full app."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Appreciate the response in pointing where the stabilization function is. I love the app. As if I'm working on a desktop application. However, the motion tracker doesn't exist on the mobile app. You have to do a manual tracking per frame or blocking of the subject. This is time consuming. I hope you add this function in your Power Director android app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is more advanced"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Premium"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Before using this video editor, I want to warn you that I have worked on many video editors. But I have not seen a stable editor like Power Director. Now I say the disadvantage of this software is that it takes a lot of time to edit videos. . It may take 2 to 3 days to edit a video, even if you press the home button or back button by mistake, understand that all your editing will be lost, like the video split, effects, video and audio sync etc."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"simply the best"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Criminal. I paid for this app however long to use features. Now it is subscription based. Now certain features that weren't a part of the subscription are a part. Seems shady. Disappointed in you. This app is great for editing mobile videos. The interface is intuitive. Occasionally, it lags. Often it speeds up the audio on playbacks while editing. Overall, great product."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"After having this app installed for 8 years, I can say powerdirector is a good app for video editing/production. However, with each update, it has become more and more glitchy to the point of being practically unusable. Figure if its this bad today on a Galaxy Tab S4, I'd hate to see what its like on lesser devices. (bad on S10 too) Note, I've tried everything from clearing cache and data to uninstalling-reinstalling the app. Download & try it.I hope it functions for you. It is feature rich"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't found video enhancer in the app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app love it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It took a second to figure out where all the features are, but this is a very nice full spectrum program."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The app seems to do better with shorter videos. It seems as though the error saying ""broken chain"" or something like that pops up a lot, especially when the video is longer. The controls on the phone are cumbersome. My suggestion is to create a way to create or mend broken links."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This is really making it easy for me to edit my videos and honestly I like it 100% thus I rate it with five stars"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Great for phone"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"The fact that I can do almost computer level editing from my phone is amazing. Sure there's probably much more in depth programs out there. But for this yearly price? It's seemless and easy to use. Once you start to learn all the cool little features. The app really starts to highlight your abilities to create either simple and quick. Or long and drawn out edits. I use it to make ATV music videos from rides with friends. Pair it with the 22 galaxy Ultra S pen. And this is the perfect app. Love ‚ù§"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Wanted to start with mp3 song and turn it into a video using AI.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even remaster video quality. There's no option for it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Totally worth installing and using as a mobile video editor on the go when you don't want to have to edit with a desktop program or transfer lots of large files. Only thing I could suggest making it better was to add an option to select multiple clips and/or pieces of audio in the timeline and be able to move them all at once. There may be a way to do that already though but I haven't seen it."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Full featured video editing software. Can't believe the power and precision through an app on the phone. I am using it on my Chromebook and it works perfectly."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Too bad"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I've really enjoyed this app overall. As of the most recent update, however, the app won't import any of my videos. I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but that has been frustrating."

I've not been able to do anything on the app and it's frustrating that I can't even edit videos with an app I paid for. Sad thing is that my subscription just renewed last month for another 1 year."

You'll get a decorder error message and the video won't download. This a big issue because people will give your app a less rating and think it's broken. BEST FREE EDITING APP THOUGH! Please fix because I would love to add ai effects but simply can't right now. Both my phones give me the same error. Please look into, thanks! üôè"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I am using since 5 years This is best editing app For phones"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it, this app is almost as good as Premiere Pro! Obviously it's not as powerful but it damn well does the job of a Filmmaker who doesn't have access to a desktop with Adobe CC"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this since 2018, and I gotta say. The new ui looks nice, but I am kinda sad that they opted to only be able to edit videos in portrait mode for your mobile. I missed being able to edit on landscape. But otherwise, this is a very good video editor. Not a lot of ads, and makes my video fast."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Dude. This is insane!! Such a powerful tool for Android Video creation. Nearly as powerful as $70 pc editors for free! Ads are very reasonable, not very intrusive, and certainly worth such versatility. You might be limited by the amount of edits you can make per session, but you can simply save the video, then open it in a new project and continue where you left off. Doesn't even take long to render, much faster than PC apps (again $70) with a low end pc/laptop. Premium is likely even better."

But one update made the experience using this app awful. Trying to move clips on the timeline became extremely difficult.

I can't tell you how much time I've wasted editing a project only to have the app freeze and lose everything. I have a brand new phone and yet it can't seem to work.

Having to download to my computer THEN UPLOAD to Google drive (at 20 to 30 minutes per video file) THEN upload from comp to this app is ridiculously time consuming. How was this overlooked and why it's this issue not yet updated? (UPDATE 4-02-24) wow what a grouch. Way more great free features & now I get why uploads can be slow. Me stoopid. Your app really progressed 4 years later. üèÅüçªüôè"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Stop changing the sound, stop changing the music, stop changing the way that text is added to the videos... You are destroying this app!!!!! When you add animation to text you used to be able to click and drag the animation to match your video... Now you just have a timer that you can adjust but you have no idea how to match it to your video... And there's tons of awesome music that is missing and awesome sound effects... Every time you guys update this thing you delete lots of good stuff...üëéüëé"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It is good for learning to edit videos. I am still learning."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Had yo uninstall it after 5 minutes. App is unusable. I cant see the beats in the audio track ao I can't make the video match the audio. Refund please!!! What a shame"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Editing options needs to be more friendly. Very difficult to operate on mobile. Still there is and opportunity to introduce More options and features."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great Video Creator"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Great editing app for my train videos I upload. I really like the transitions and text features. The only reason I didn't give the 5th star is because even with the ""Premium"" subscription, you need to pay more to access some ai video/picture features."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"App stucked every now and then despite multiple times reinstalling it. Did many video with this app before, used to be a 5 stars from me, but now definitely not unless issues being resolved.. done with whatever advices given to me by the app helpline, but seems like issues not resolved!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Newest edit: this app is absolute trash for mobile...everyone lost their old $5 premium purchase, new premium purchase members cannot switch the account to PC like we used to...it's become a pay2use app. NO CB CORP, WE CAN NOT RESTORE OR PURCHASES THX FOR THE LIES. 2nd previous edit: How do I get my previous boughten upgrade/premium back? Prior to edit: Always used this to edit videos, for years now."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Forgive me and I will give you one star. I have a little doubt and once that doubt is cleared I will give you 5 stars. I have taken one year plan subscribe... iStock pro video Do I have to pay you anything separately to use this?.. This is my doubt"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I Have an issue with the new audio layer design. It makes it difficult to line up audio and see right away which audio is which. I wish there was a setting to change it back to the old display. The new display is actually more cumbersome than the last one, for me. I enjoy the app a lot, but this new update makes it much harder to edit."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It should be set and forget. But I always find myself moving a clip or slide I already put in position. This app has a mind of its own. Imma try my best to get this current music video I have in place perfect. Then I'm never using this app again."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"The software is decent. Not sure it adds that much more than the default video editor in samsung phones. The AI stuff is a joke. You can import an image of you, or video (video at a price) and it will render an animated version. It's not one you can show someone and them go ""oh that's an animated version of you"" instead it'd br like asking Google to get a random photo and give it to you. The AI portion is completely irrelevant and needs major improvement."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"GREAT APP, especially if you go pro. Only glitch is a few bugs that make it hard on a small phone screen to move segments around as they 'stick.' Second- position of tracks clips, and effects can get displaced and dispersed after saving. Creating a lot of replacing. This seems to happen a lot if a lot of Ai effects are used even on a 2 minute edit. I highly recommend this if your on a budget, film commando fashion, or are veryentry level on editing, to well seasoned."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Its the best of all i have ever seen,during other apps download"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"So nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Baaki chalane k baad ok"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Can we just buy it, instead of yearly subscription? Like in the pc versi√≥n."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Very nice bro But why you added a new feature Bro"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Very best video editor app but very glitches are there please fix this"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Forced review popups are annoying so whenever an app gives me review popups I immediately rate 1 star. Very annoying. I'd give 0 stars if I could. I'm not reviewing this product. Annoying."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"It is the best when it comes to trending and amazing effects. All are just useless because you can't use it because of the cost of payment and premium features. If you download this app you're wasting your efforts."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"good editing app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"After using this app for about 4yrs I can say I still LOVE IT!!! So easy to use, super dope to play with even for a tech-challenged person like myself. You staying up-to-date with editing tools and remain inexpensive! I will be a customer for life! Only issue is there should be a way to restore purchase on all devices. For instance I have an iPhone and an android. I had to buy the app twice so that I can use it on both phones. That's corny. Also there should be a lifetime purchase option as well"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is just usless, I paid money and buyed the premium version, but it gives me an error that powerdirector encountered an error in decoding the video, even though my phone is brand new, waste of money and time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"great app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Heads up...App doesn't work well on low battery or with too many things running which is normal so that's your fault lol i love it! Works great! I love All the new a.i. features and absolutely love the missions they give that allow you to use premium for a day or two once completed. I use this to make all my videos."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I can't seem to edit mobile but over pretty good app not for mobile creators tho"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Do not buy premium, and if you did then you can use premium only in one cellphone which linked to the account from Play Store tou bought it instead of cyberlink account. GUI is slow even in One Plus 11 5G, it takes atleast 5 seconds just to open. Even after buying premium you still have to extra for some ai features. Totally useless"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy fast keeps data so you can work on projects later"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Would be nice to know up front that you can't do jack without paying."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I've been using this software for quite a while now and it doesn everything I needed to do. I make art videos on YouTube I showed the actual video of me drawing it and do my commentary and have a little Avatar at the bottom left corner. If you're just beginning to start editing this is a great software to use:D"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I couldn't download my output"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This latest Update is not the greatest. The new drag feature is such an Inconvenience to use. Also you go to Produce the video, It tells you video cant be Produced due to coding issues. It Lags the farther along you get in editing a video, Plus when you try to add music or a layer you cant see which one is which unless you click on it. Making the total experience a huge pain in the..... As a long time ""Paying"" customer, i hope its fixed. Again, ""If it aint broke dont fix it"""
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Quick, easy to use, would recommend üëç"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"No words about it's facilities"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The most frustrating, unenjoyable experience I have ever had trying to put subtitles on a video. The auto subtitles are inaccurate. Editing them is near impossible. Syncing them to the sound would not work. Then trying to pay for the trial was impossible. All around made me want to end myself. I'm so glad I gave up and deleted it. Simply put if you don't have a lot of money you will likely hate this as much as me."

I have uninstalled this app since it was getting auto shoutdown stating there is no enough space even though there were no space issue in my android phone. Next irritating thing happened at the time of producing video the application shuts down saying an error encountered when decoding the video.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I want the PowerDirector from 2021 back. ‚Ä¢ Video/Image clips always shift to random spots in the timeline. ‚Ä¢ Rearranging clips is risky as you never know if moving a clip will cause other clips in the timeline to shift or glitch out. ‚Ä¢ I always have to pause/unpause the music multiple times before it's in sync with the video. ‚Ä¢ Default Transition Duration was removed a while back. Now, adding/adjusting transitions has more tedium and less flexibility. ‚Ä¢ Pin feature is useless."

I've put in a ticket, then days later got a ""sorry for the inconvenience this is a known issue we're working on."" OK fine so it's been a few weeks and I'm thinking surely it must be fixed. Nope. They sure don't hesitate to take my money every month though. Or add features I really could not care less about. Will be looking into something else."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"A great tool in editing video, a lot of tools to choose from."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for many years to edit my videos. It's a great app, except for today.

If anything has to change its how Powerlink Director runs and fixes its glitches, bugs, and errors."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Still glitchy for years now, they don't make some of the functions easy to use. I'm a mobile videographer And I wish it was as smooth as a laptop. Examples are buttons. Trash button too high up. Also the videos keep playing‚ñ∂Ô∏è even when u slide the clip to edit, the system should detect that after a couple manual rewinds it should know ur trying to edit and it should stop playing continuous. Also the music and the video do not align when your editing midway, you have to restart the whole video."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"As one of the orginal supporters of this app, who actually purchased it & promoted it to help the developers grow it, i'm finding we are being screwed over more and more. Basic features, like basic transitions are now becoming premium only, pushing us to the subscription model, which for those who already purchased it, have no interest in using. Stability issues are also becoming the norm. Its a shame the long term supporters are being abused in such away and speaks volumes about the developers."

Now, I'm unable to drop or move video to a different area without it being spliced into some layer of sorts...its such a headache. adds more time to video editing etc. I'm not sure what the layering is supposed to do I find it annoying and unhelpful."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years with little to almost no issues, but since you make all these fancy features available it causes the app not to save my projects. Not even a 35sec clip can save!!!! TF! I had to cut my 2:45min project into 4 and updated the app and still it doesn't save a 35sec piece. All this work for nothing!! I Have decided to write this here because you want access to my media via email which is bull. I'm thinking of uninstalling since my Huawei app seems to work better."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Very good but missing key apple feature. Great video editing app. Best I've tried so far. However it is missing a key feature object tracking! This is available on the Apple version but not Android!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"After my stroke I needed a eazy program to learn. I tried other programs and software with lackluster results. Bravo to Power Director!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome. I'm really enjoying it when getting my short videos and photos together for editing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I‚Äôve been using this app for years and it‚Äôs the only one that I‚Äôve really enjoyed it with. It‚Äôs easy and convenient to use and its contains all the necessary tools to edit videos in the best possible way. There are no ads( apart from the app that appears when you enter the application) and this greatly favors its use."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Updates for Jan 2024: wow. How could it get any worse? The new timeline features cause delays in sound after making clips of the video. The application said there was not enough memory on my flagship Samsung phone and crashed so many times that Android asked me to clear the cache and in an error stated ""because this application has a bug."""
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Why is the cropping tool broken now? Just who is programming this app?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Pretty easy and nice editing especially with u tube transfer. ---->8 years later STILL! My goto video editor. 100%"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Sense the new update. I can't produce a video after hours of editing in any form. Even bought a BRAND NEW PHONE. Just gets a fail window after 4% everytime on both phones. Been user for years..."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I paid for this app, and it will not let me use any feature.Then I tried to resubscribe, and it says it can't complete the action. After reaching out to the developer, they were able to restore my purchas. Thank you. üôè I have been using this app for a few years. It is amazing. Thank you again for your help"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"These developers who think they can offer a product that offers no demo/trial and force us to pay for it before we can even have the chance to try it out to see if it is something we may want to continue or not continue to use? NOPE!!! UNINSTALLED!!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"My 6 years of creation with PowerDirector was amazing new features and other stuff. It made my YouTube Channel's dream with PowerDirector and I hope I can through 10 years with you."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY Now that I have paid for the app it stops working properly? I tried to adjust the video order on the master track, as I have done before, the video that is over an hour long is now ruined. I close down the app and open back it up, now every individual clip is now in extreme slow motion? A year subscription seems like a waste now."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"First of all very cool app i love it but the only issue is that the app always asks if i want premium or not besides that its very cool"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"From 4 to 3 stars. These new updates are annoying. After I hit export all my clips move around and I watch back a video I didnt create. This isn't the 1st time this happened. I dont have time to keep fixing mistakes I didnt make. Hitting export should be a moment of relief not holding my breath. It's also weird how the cover of my videos are stills from videos I did last year that aren't saved to power director nor my device. Fix this mess please."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! I prefer this much more than the Mac/ Windows app if I'm honest!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Puts a small watermark in the corner."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"As one of the orginal supporters of this app, who actually purchased it & promoted it to help the developers grow it, i'm finding we are being screwed over more and more. Basic features, like alot of transitions are now becoming premium only, pushing those to the subscription model, which if we already purchased it, have no interest in using. Stability issues are also becoming the norm. Its a shame the long term supporters are being abused in such away and speaks volumes about the developers."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app for editing"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"update"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Awsome app with lot of features but big problem I have is I put a 9:16 video into a 9:16 aspect ratio project and everything is normal while I edit. But when I export the video it's as if it cropped the image slightly smaller than 9:16 so I get this little black line as if the video is the wrong size BUT ITS NOOOOOOOT ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The might of a PC video editor in the palm of your hand. Well worth the subscription."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Tip: Watch the tips! Some of the AI stuff is padding and much of it is not fully functional yet. But as an Android editor, it is hard to beat."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"You aint getting no premission to go through my videos or files. Hell no. You can stick ur editor up ur ü§îüòÅ"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I'd been a big proponent of this app for a while now but the update removing the original denoise feature and replacing it with a limited AI one has truly lowered my opinion. The AI denoise has one strength and it's bad. Makes the human voice robotic in a way the old feature didn't. I wouldn't care if the original denoise feature was left in. But as far as I can tell, it wasn't."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"please make an option turn on/off vibration."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Really great and useful app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Why does it keep trying to charge again and again for the same option to use animation? Every time I try to animate a video it asks for money. I'm responding to the company's response. You didn't understand what I was saying. Your app is asking for payment several times in one day for the same feature. You're telling me thats normal?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice tool to edit, make more effects easy to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Cukup menyenangkan sejauh ini"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"The best"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing, it is free for all the basic editing you need. I use this app to edit all my YouTube videos. If you don't want the Powerdirector watermark in the corner than you do have to pay money to remove it, but besides that, Powerdirector has been the best free editing platform yet. I tried using filmora once but that had a watermark right in the middle of the video, I had already edited the video. So, I want to say thank you for making a truly amazing editing app. Worth installing.üåü"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"custom zoom won't work and keeps loading"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Never have I been disappointed more with a customer experience. I bought 30 seconds of AI filter, tried it on a 4 second clip, and all my seconds went away. This pricing model is outright criminal. Also the results were not that impressive. You basically can't have any movement on your video and the footage needs to be tight shots."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This app watermark free nhi . So bad for poor .ü§®"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Easy, versatile, exceptional results but customer service I s terrible. They really dont care and just want your money, and are happy to keep it after you cancel. You won't get refunded no matter how many criteria for refund you fullfill. Great function in app but if your phone doesn't work with it. Tough luck!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I didn't like it. To complicated. I need fast and simple."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"PowerDirector is an impressive video editing app that has been incredibly helpful for my projects. What's even better is that it occasionally offers free access to premium features, which is a huge plus! The interface is user-friendly, and the app performs seamlessly. Highly recommend!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Over the last couple of years power director has fixed basically all the bugs I haven't had issues in forever and ever. Way to go! I can't decide if it's causing my videos to be a bit blurry, I have not tested this theory*** but I am still impressed with the endless possibilities and the background remover is worth the monthly fee alone!!!!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"My phone has been FREEZING since downloading this. Can't compress videos, so how are you meant to send them??? The file is way too large. Ridiculous that a video editor doesn't provide this, given others do. Would've given 5 stars otherwise, but this is a huge deal. Deleting."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"1/25/21- Good video editing app for a beginner like me. As I figure it out more, I like it even more. UPDATE 3/4/24 - OMG, the latest update has been one headache after another. I have to completely exit the app and open it back up in order to complete my editing, sometimes losing what I was working on. I've used this app for 3 years with very little complaint and now I need to start looking for some other app as this one is now wasting too much of my time. So sad...."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Update March 2024. Most of the app seems to function well still but you have new features like the AI voice changer and it works great except when you export it, then it just changes your voice back to the way it was. You should be able to keep the voice change when you produce the film! Why l make a feature you can't use? I mean it works, I'm glad I get to hear it but I want others too as well. Scoured the internet and can't find a solution! üò°"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for a long time and would have given it 5 stars a year ago. But after a recent update, I will only give it 1 at best. It has so many glitches that it is impossible to use. Clips get moved around and can end up anywhere. Audio on videos goes very strange. Clips mesh together, so you can not tell them apart or speed up/slow down for no reason."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Works great for what I need!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Asome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Got to the point where I lost the love of making videos. After years of paying for the subscription and really liking the program, sometime beginning last year it would constantly spew out ""Codec issues"" thus preventing me from producing any videos. I complained many times and they wouldn't respond. Spend countless hours on projects to never produce them is frustrating. Multiple phones, all of the tricks to get passed the issue, always the same result. I warned you, no more of my money!!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Every time I open the app, I get watermarks and a subscription page. I can not access all the features even though I pay the monthly fee. I have to go to the Play Store to open the app instead of straight through my phone. I've been having this problem for well over a year. I have asked Customer service to help fix this issue, and nothing. Why should I beg someone to fix something I am paying for over and over. I'm not eating my time anymore, so I will not be renewing this month."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! I've had the premium version of this app for a few years and always had 3 Google accounts on my phone. Already 2x (once last year and another last week) it will say ""this device is linked to more than one Google account"". It's weird cause if I delete one account, it works. Once I put it back in it does it again. Once my subscription is up, I'm finding a better app. This developer makes it difficult to use this! Plus when they update it, there's always a big/messed up"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Basic editing options you can find just about anywhere. I paid $30 for features my phone already has the ability to do. Probably less than. The AI features are cool I guess but again can be found anywhere today and at no cost."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Was a good review but do not purchase if you care about your debit/credit card they make it nearly impossible to get subscriptions canceled and it auto renews and doesn't even show you have membership even when the moneys being pulled out of account plus you can't really get a hold of anyone. If this is fixed in a timely manner I'll change review"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: Went from bad to worse: Captions got better, still not great. You have to animate each and every caption sentences. So if it breaks up your captions into 20 sentences you have to animate 20 sentences. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moving clips around us a disaster. Like everyone else stated those blocked clips they say that supposed to make this easier made it far worse. You also can't choose where to put clips etc. It will add your clip to a line, then moves previous clips out of place. IT'S BAD"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"A few years ago i used it that old versions were amazing but udated version has bug and some features are not working please fix it..

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app. Loving it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Before the update I would have given this 5 stars, considering I have been happily using it to edit for years. But? You changed the entire format of the app making it more difficult to use. I'm having to relearn things I have been doing for years. And? I was hoping the update would bring simpler things- like automatic object tracking? I can't even get the manual slow key frame way to work. It's bad. I'm looking at your competitors now."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Totally Rubbish this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best demo/free editing software. Can't wait to purchase completely. No ads. Not pushy about purchasing full app."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"the latest update destroyed the easy useful experience I use this app for. AI denoise is garbage for long form audio with no access to changing it if you don't like the outcome, forced into 10 minute clips only (really 8 minutes), when you save what you are working on and come back, it adds back all the noise you worked on removing, adding more time, also causes glitches to audio files when using, the new moving clips on timeline is jumpy and glitched. Support repeats back your feedback like AI"

I've used this app for over 4 years now and I've tried others but stopped bothering as this app is kept up to date if not ahead of other apps."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Im annoyed by the new update! If you want to drag clips from 1 part of the top timeline to another, it is now so difficult, awful. Cant see the Mins & impossible work.Pls fix it!I both love & hate this app. I have it for 7 months, the paid version. I understand it is HUGE & difficult to run. I am careful to clear cache & make sure the memory on the pad isn't full. But quite often, in the middle of using the program, it just stops working. You have to force stop & it works fine again for a time."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Something went buggy and now it destroys my edits. It's resizes while I'm adding clips and wont let me place them where I'd like to. It also hasn't been letting me access my premium features despite being a long paying customer. I use this app so much to edit my stuff, but the weird bugs ruined a special deadline I had! It wouldn't let me drag and drop without scrambling everything I had already worked on the day before. So frustrating! I've had good days with this app but the bad days are bad!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Beautiful experience"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Make all my Sugar Shane Film videos using this app. Only things I'd disagree with is the way the transitioning is set up. I always have to start back back at the beginning after i pick one, and it takes a long time to do my picture videos this way. Also that when I do my longer videos, it glitches out, and I have to restart the app. Other than that. It's a good tool for video making."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Went from 5 star to 1 star overnight with latest update. Trying to move clips around on time line is now impossible. I was 90% through a project, after battling moving clips and then suddenly sound was messed up, clips missing, speeds changed. Clicking undo made things even worse. Had to scrap the whole project. The only plus that came from the update was the AI voice enhancer and better denoise but it's pointless when nothing else functions. Restore it back to the way it was pleassssssse!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and easy to learn but you need to pay money to get the full version so 4/5 but if you're rich then it's 5/5 because you could buy the full version of this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Videos edit"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"EDIT: dropped to 1 star because my project that took way too long to edit now has no timeline (although it still thinks it does). I used this for stop motion, it being highly recommended. Unfortunately it comes in slightly too short. On mobile, clicking every image to import isn't going to work. On desktop it is a bit unstable albeit much more so than any other programme I've tried in the last 15 years. It's 2024 I still can't find an editing software that can handle a 1 minute animation."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great editor!! I'm a content creator that just started my YouTube channel and this is best, most easy to use but packs a punch when it comes to extras video editor out there! I've used it to create and edit 3 videos inside of a month and they are all on point!"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Best app for editing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"very easy to use !"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"All useful or unique features are behind a paywall. The premium features like cutout also do not work as well as other apps that allow you to use this feature for free. Waste of time."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Good app nice job"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved using it. I was using it on a daily basis. Now, nothing works! For some reason every time i load the app it loads as if i don't have a premium account and it won't restore my purchases. In addition none of the premium features work and it adds a watermark to the videos. I tried to contact support but i am getting robotic responses that don't lead to solutions. Most likely moving to a different app if it can't be solved"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Suresh"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Good üëç"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Why is it that there's no produce edited video .."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience which I believe to be the best free video editing tool software! Its got amazing in built features which truly sets it apart!!! Thanks, video editing has been made easy - always my go-to app!!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"After update Auto-caltion feature and text use interface is not user friendly at all. these things should be considered carefully before applying updates to existing version of the app."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Glitchy, awful app for Chromebook. I have been using it the app for YEARS and it consistently unsyncs the audio and video, prevents you from changing the volume on clips, glitches out certain clips after rendering, freezes when moving clips & needs to reset, crashes constantly! I have made decent videos with it in spite of these issues, but I am on my last nerve. With the latest update, shifting clips has become a nightmare, with every clip getting moved around at random. Use another program."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"what is the issue with 70% of your music being copyrighted. I'm getting fed up with having to upload every music track and getting strikes. I'm premium too, my YouTube channel is suffering because of this, please fix."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app I have a YouTube channel. And I can edit my video's"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Super good and easy to learn program. However, so much is locked behind a subscription. disappointing, but understandable. Crashes INSANELY frequently. I've used PD for 5+ years and I've always had crashing issues."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome application thanks to power director ü§ùüôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"App is superb but since 2 months getting not enough memory issue frequently"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"You suck! It didn't warn me about the auto-repayment! I thought I bought this so for $35! Not an auto -subscription at that rate! I used this app twice!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"So when I first downloaded this several years ago, it was losing to Inshot for the best FREE mobile footage editing app. When this app hit Open public trials, it was awful, But ended up being the best app, IMO. when a company releases the product prematurely for customer/product feedback, the intention is free research and development, or R&D. It can be a very successful tactic. The public trials also give The developers WAY more R&D than what the company would be able to handle by themselves."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been working with it the paid version for a year and enjoyed it. However, I feel the new update has problems. The main one is that it's harder to rearrange your media timeline. Once every so often, when I wanna move a file to an earlier point in the timeline, another file gets shifted. Its REALLY frustrating and all-in-all dramatically slowed down speed."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Still using this app works wonderfully!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest update made the app unusable, please revert to previous version and redo your testing before going live..."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Quick, powerful, and easy to use! Cost money, but you get what you pay for"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Average app, important future are chargeable"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Too much time consumed while editing. Use any advanced mobile processing take too much time. Other similar apps are great than this app as other apps are user friendly and after editing othet apps take lesser time to convert it into video. New irrigating consent form"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It works"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Undo your last update... worked better before. Moving things around in order is terrible. I'd rather hold down and scroll with it like before. Never drops in proper location. Things are not saving now. I cropped many thing, added zoom/pan back ground blur. Go to home and like i did nothing and things are out of order. Makes doubles of things. Way buggy now. Will go back to using PC editing software. This just made small things convenient.üò¢üòî"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I cannot edit it keeps crashing trash"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"February 20, 2024 - why am I getting ads and a watermark on my paid subscription? **UPDATE** - February 21, 2024. I did as you suggested. I cleared the cache from the app and rebooted my phone. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It seems to be working fine now. Plus there is a whole lot of new features. Thank you for the help."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I use Power Director for editing all of my videos. I use the online version and the windows app depending on the project. Love it!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I like this app, but ultimately I don't want to pay something per month. I just want to pay a one time fee to buy it & that's it."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"So smooth"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Didn't remove audio from video as expected. Not worth my time to text support and get solution when it clearly says in AI Audio denoise. I use denoise and audio is still there. I canceled and will probably never get refund but I will just play the video on my phone and screen record with no sound."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It's Good"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste of money,literally, i tried AI video twice, even with subscription you need to pay every video, i tried twice more than ‚Ç¨6 payed,after uploading video app pops up message ""something went wrong,try again"" if you try again it asks for money again. What a robbery"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Was good tell this wierd last snap clip update. Hate the snap clipping plus it makes the app glitch bad bad"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using PowerDirector for almost 4 years, and I am having tons of fun creating great videos to upload on my YouTube channel. So glad I discovered this easy way to edit!!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to love the app. I've had it for a year now. The whole app has totally changed over night. I can't even use it now."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"""Media, then select .... audio"" Does not exist as option under media. There is an extract audio under ai, but every attempt on every multi audio track video = error"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Must have for all content creators! It's literally one stop shop for video editing on Android! ‚ù§Ô∏è But please, I'm begging you, make the photo/video collage feature like in CapCut üôè"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nest app ever. Easy to use and navigate."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Powerdirector, you ARE the problem. I just got a new phone not too long ago, and the app STILL crashes. I literally just downloaded this app a few days ago, so it can't be my phone. Fix the bugs, and I'll consider giving this app 4 stars since it has most of the things I need."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Now, instead of focusing on putting ads, inside an already paid for app, maybe fix your bugs, add features like sorting in music, manually sorting the tool bar so we can turn off your useless garbage you add there, so we don't have to scroll 5 times to get to what we need. That would be great. Can't wait for Samsungs new video editor to go main stream, your app will be so utterly useless and redundant."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Tryin this vid editor i hope this is good!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Honestly... been using the app for many years and the last few updates have made it clunky if you will complicated and laggy. Music and pictures randomly jump around. I have to double and triple check a edit way more then I used too. I preferred the app about 5 updates ago."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm I love with this app. im sure I could have married it when it has to be a woman .... God bless the creator"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Very good app Thank to developer"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"You make it seem as if it's going to be free until a person opens the app and it prompts them to purchase usage of the app. Which is stupid, especially for what price you were asking."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Oh hello!! Where is istock pro?? Has that option been gone???"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Keeps re-starting all of a sudden. I've made three other more basic videos, and those went very well. I really like how you can change the view ratio between YouTube and tiktok. There are a lot (in my opinion) editing options, effects, and filters you can use. I checked for an update, but there are none needed. I'm super disappointed because this app has 5 star potential if it wasn't re starting."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"The app is awesome"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"The app has a bug after updating yesterday"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Found this app by searching 8k but it doesn't support 8k. It showed up for hdr, but it does not support this either. Or does it? I don't know because I'm not paying for something to test it . App looks very cheap"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Edit...24 hours later CyberLink issued another update which fixed the issue for old perpetual license users of placing Adjustment tools under a subscription only tag. Use the Edit tag on far left of tool bar and there is now a second Adjustment tools allowing access for perpetual license users. Well done CyberLink on quickly fixing a large problem quickly with an update."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great handheld alternative to VSCO or Photoshop, especially if you need video edited quickly, just improve the resolution on the filters and I'm hooked"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Voice changer is the best feature in this app and editing also very easy. Thank you for new features."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Testing this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"A workspace without the option to use my device's file browser to pull files from places like Dropbox simply isn't usable, and the only thing ""revolutionary"" about AI features is the phenomenal shortsightedness one must have to endorse or use these features."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! This is all you'll ever need to make professional quality videos!!! ***It's now 2024, and the app is even better than it was when I first posted this review (in 2019)! At least 10x BETTER with all the added features!!!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome love every bit of it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it so far, not a fan of the bubble of the logo if I don't subscribe. Update: I subscribed, it's very good and handy to edit videos on the go. Has all the necessary tools I had on a PC app I had."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Good and some not so good.. I like the app, but it seems to get unstable with larger videos. I haven't committed to premium because I mostly make videos for fun. I don't make money from them, and I'd want to get better with the app before paying for premium. In the free version, is it just me or is the ""watermark"" WAY more prominent in the PC version? Like huge, and it's more of a color stamp than a watermark. I watched a tutorial video for the mobile version, and some features are missing üòï"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I love the ease of this app. But baby, since y'all changed your music, it is so hard to find good quality options.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"PowerDirector Video Editor stands out as the best video editing tool I've ever used, thanks to its intuitive interface and a wide array of advanced features.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"The app glitches allowed on a Samsung Galaxy s23. For example, the fade diamond won't remove if you add one. Another example, you'll watch the add to export in 4k then play it and it doesn't align with your settings. Once you go home and go back to the project it shows the edits that did play. Lastly, overlays are glitchy even when using the pen. As opposed to moving smoothly so you can place it where you prefer especially seeing you don't have a zoom in feature to be extremely precise, it jumps"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It is a very good video/audio editing app. However, when I am browsing through my music files, it can be a bit tedious to have to find each song in a large list.

HOWEVER, I used to love the music selection (specifically the epic stuff) but all the music changed now and there is nothing left from the music I used to use. It has all been replaced with some nonsensical not well organized music that unfortunately isn't that good. The composers that I used are also all gone. What happened??"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Tried to get this going went through all the steps and even put my credit card info where it needed to be and nothing has happened no subscription but not billed yet either.

Im 61 and wanted to learn something beneficial."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"What a misleading scam. So when I'm saving my project and returning to work on it , it's saying I used a premium feature / effect or something when I clearly did not... And attempting to get me to purchase the premium version. This is extremely unethical. Especially since I was considering getting the premium version beforehand... It has done it across all my projects that are a work in progress ... I'll go use other tools now since this is that janky and skeptical. Wonder what else youre up to!"

Otherwise my next review will be one star and fed up words and uninstall. And I know I won't be the only one."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I also use the desktop version. IMO the best mobile app you can find in the category. I can now edit most my daily and weekly social video posts while watching TV w/ the family. So that time is finally productive time!!! I spend 5x longer in desktop video editting, too. There are a few subtle design changes that are missing from the desktop version so minus one star. However, you must know I have tried many video editting and this is the only 4 star I have used. It deserves a 4.50 honestly."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"So i've been using this app for some time now, and it has been rather useful but what I absoluelty HATE is the sometimes useless updates. A huge example is why the hell would you need to change how the pan and zoom works? I can't even use the main screen to zoom in when I use the pan and zoom but the app makes me use the two smaller boxes below which is annoying. That's not even mentioning how if I use it now it causes other parts of my video to be zoomed in when I never even attempted to do so"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Ich liebe die App seit Jahren, habe damals auch in die Entfernung des Wasserzeichens investiert,aber seitdem ich auf ein neues Ger√§t und damit wohl auch neue Updates gewechselt bin, kann ich keine Videos mehr in 4K Qualit√§t exportieren, das finde ich einen ganz ganz gro√üen R√ºckschritt, war eines meiner liebsten Features. Au√üerdem ist es kaum m√∂glich genaue Schnitte zu setzen, wenn man das Video nicht jedes Mal von vorne abspielt, weil Tonspur und Video einfach asynchron werden, super √§rgerlich."

The only problem I have is the almost-every-editing lagging issues I have it (which may be because of phone-app compatibility‚Äîi have a class-b local phone) all the time, which is making me quite annoyed and frustrated. I still understand 'cause this updated version is more suitable for newer phones or old phones with upgraded software... I wish there was more fonts, though. But it's okay. Still has 720p and smoother results at least. üòä"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Best direction app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Okay Let's keep it short. This is not for Long/big Video editing. This app is purely Cr@p. It's so laggy and can't play the video,constantly crashes, and it's just unbearable. How am I suppose to edit a video if I can't see the playback. And who the F gave it a 5 star? It has a lot of features but Lags too much. An L from me. Go for Capcut Or Kinemaster they are a lot better."

There are black lines at the top and bottom of my 16:9 videos, and my portrait ones don't fill the screen. I hope it is corrected. | I love this app. Edited 1-9-24: Why do I pay for the music library to use on YouTube if I do not have rights to the music? YouTube has dinged me several times for this."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"easy to use..wish there are more music sound track that sounds cool"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"i purchased lifetime back when it was available. I restored my perpetual account but wish it would tell me what i unlocked. i understand there are new features to the subscription but if you wanted the option to not show the things you didn't buy that would be nice too. Also since the subscription apparently unlocks everything you should offer a discount to the perpetual owners since they already own some features if not what's the point to have perpetual features if you subscribe."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great video editing app. One request though. when I extract the audio from a video, I don't really want to produce it as an mp4, give me the option to produce it as an mp3 sound file."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is great because it can be used for making videos and just did one"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"They charged me a few years ago so the watermark wasn't there and when I went to use it again they had changed things into subscription based."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the app up until now. You see, when I save the video I edited the video picture becomes more squarish which makes the picture smaller than the original video I edited. Don't get me wrong, I love all the features/tools that the app provides. It's just that I don't like it when the picture gets smaller and more squarish from the original video."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm subscribed, but I still have problems with editing, still get error codes and choppy editing"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It's good when it comes to simple things and you don't need to pay for some of the transmission and adding music it's much better than splice which you have to pay for almost everything 10/5"

However, this process MUST be used after a beta test of each effect batch so that you know which old effects to make free. Thank you for reading, and have a good day."

I bought your software since mid 2000s, bought PD9 & others AND got awarded a Special photo editor for my Exemplary Assistance 2u in the days you were GLAD of support. My PD9 was rendered USELESS when I couldn't use it on the next Windows upgrade, you MADE me buy again and I bought the android BUNDLE editor with this but you deem it out of date for my S23 Ultra 512, UTTER B/S I REFUSE.

I wish powerdirecter had options for stereo audio options for clips similar to what kinemaster does, but make it trackable, like how audio can get higher or lower as the video continues in powerdirecter when you track it. It would make power director a far better app for me."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your money on this application, the tutuorials don't align with the menus and the application constantly freezes/locks up on a Chromebox with an I7 processor and 16 gig of RAM and one gig internet connection. The interface doesn't allow for resizing when launched and the look and feel is amateurish at best. I spent several hours trying to put together an intro video and no success. I was trying to avoid Apple and IMovie because the TCO on driod is better, but this isn't acceptable"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Is absolutely useless for makeing godzilla stop motion vids"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used a few editing software but for something that's free this is really good. Especially since other than pushing its own subscription service it doesn't bother you with loads of adverts at all. If I was to pay for it outright though if probably rate it a 4 star, just because I personally find some of its features a little clunky. Tbf I may get used to them so I'm giving it the benefit of doubt."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, barely usable, you can still get your work done but I will not recommend using this app to edit your videos, There are better editting apps out there but this one begs you to buy the premium. This app also has lots of bugs and the mechanics aren't smooth at all, in fact they are really annoying at times, sometimes your edit doesnt turn out to be the same thing once you've finished and downloaded, Sometimes I find my editted in stuff just misplaced. So I wouldn't recommend it"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Been over a year and the audio issues are still prevalant...cut it to where you want to start, move it to video start and it plays like you never cut it at all. Idk why i thought this app would be better by now. Also customer support is absolutely no help with anything. You bring up an issue and they just respond with ""well its working for me"" like you are imagining it or something. Had this problem with 2 different issues that are STILL unresolved."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm a long time user of this app now and it's been awesome. The music and sound fx library is massive, sometimes it takes a long time to go through looking for the right sound OR that one mundane sound your looking for isn't there lol that's ok. I don't get the subscription to much because I find I only need it maybe once or twice a month. That may change in the near future as I'm recording more often now."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"We can zoom a video or not"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice easy and professional"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to navigate for beginners, and the free version has a ton of options. I will say, though, for less than $7 a month for the paid version.

Yes there will be a watermark, but it's free LOL. It's not an issue for me. There are a lot of features I don't use, or know how to use, but my videos are straight-forward for teaching purposes - I don't need anything fancy.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good app, but lack two very important features. After completion video can be downloaded while keeping app in foreground. Due to which we can't use the phone till the time video is downloaded. It would be too good if video can be downloaded while keeping the app in background.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This is one the best video editing app I have used so far thank you for producing this app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I'm rating this app for the text to image.. I tested it against Mid Journey (which I pay for) and it produces images just as good as MJ and does not have the strict filtering. Plus it's much cheaper than MJ to get the same quality. Now you don't get all the upscaling, different versions, seeds, quality style numbers, but for someone that just wants to play around and not get very technical with the details, this is a great app to play with. Plus you get a 7 day free trial. This is on 11/25/23"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"This is garbage. Don't get it no matter what."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Zero features, can't edit anything. U click a square and it's done? No way to adjust. No settings? Blacks, texture, light, luminous, nothing? This is a joke."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is quite useful for the most part. I would kindly ask if you could allow us to have control/slcustomisation over the voice changer effects? Also, could you give us the option to export audio files such as MP3 and wav?"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I liked that you have so many options but I also do not like that it's kinda laggy."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using PowerDirector."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Primary annoyance is currently with AI visuals. If you splice a single image for video use and apply the AI effect for part of the video to the image, then disable for the same image with no transition - the image moves out slightly. In other words, applying an AI effect zooms slightly out of the image, which is slightly annoying. Probably an easy fix that I look forward to."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great App for video editing"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Still like it, but for some reason under the fx tab the none selection is missing. Makes more tedious just hitting the back button until I get back to where I need to be."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"As much as I would love to give this app a five-star rating. The app in itself is great! It gives you creative ideas and great clarity. My only issue is that I am not able to export or convert the video I have completed. The app states, ""I either don't have storage space or there is an error."" This is unfortunate because I had paid for the full year for the app, and now I have to restart my project and possibly by the PC version. Pls help"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I don't use Android anymore so I cancelled your subscription on 15 th Nov as it was due on 20 th Nov. Still Rs. 2000 got deducted from my credit card automatically. Kindly Refund my money."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"I really want to give 5 stars, & I still might if their help/support is reliable & can help me make it stop CRASHING! But it's got some really cool features, & [hmmMOST of] the effects are not too cheesy, ya know? (I don't like it when my video productions look cheap & low-budget.) But the thing is really easy to use. The buttons make sense & do what you'd expect they should do (as opposed to some apps where you test the buttons to find out & wreck your entire project!)"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I had better luck with a completely free app ."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Good mobile video editor"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is the best. I have been using it since 2017 and yes all free but does have premium for advanced editing. There's one thing very minor and that is when the editing in in progress but if a video clip or picture is removed from its original album or file, the project indicates project media error (media file removed) and the editing starts over again. However, this app is awesome, to the developers, I'll give more stars if permitted...."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"2023 now u update a lot wow 10 out 10 THE BEST VIDEO APP ON GOOGLE PLAY STORE ...iv been sub for a bit .please can I ask why can't I pay my GOOGLE PLAY cards now ...and only by bank account . üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is actually a really good app, and here's why. First of all, the variety of editing you can do is huge. You can do just about anything Microsoft PowerPoint can do from your phone. Also, the possibility of 4k videos is awesome, along with 60fps for those who use pc or have extremely high processing on your phone. I have a 6bg dual processor for a base phone to go off of, I would put this at a 4 stars just because the intros and outros are kind of limited as far as variety goes."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Seems good. I'm very new at trying to edit video on android with a Chromebook. Was trying to learn how to use Power director audio features and then decided I'd give it a go with subscribing on the newbie deal. Clock ran down while setting up a new card and then got errors trying to subscribe. Only wanting to put together super simple informational videos and boost the audio a bit. App seems good once you figure out what you're doing but perhaps video editing on a Chromebook is pushing it."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"My subscription is not working, it still tells me to go premium even though i already have a premium subscription.

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice and clean"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"Occasional crashing or freezing, and sometimes difficult to drag timelines longer or shorter for elements. Other than that, works fine so far, has some cooler effects than other applications out there, and if you max out the output settings, you get results better than similar applications, although still degraded in quality from original input."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Top of the best"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"I had to exit out after they made this subscription based. I think developers and business should not look at subscription based model because majority of users are not pro video editors. Like I used them occasionally. I was ok to pay one time rather than monthly. Moved on to luma."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent I love it"

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great App! Easy to figure out if you are a beginner."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great top notch üëå"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",4,"With three hundred and sixty-five days of experience using PowerDirector, I can honestly say that it is a great video editing tool, for beginners who are seeking to gain experience fastly. The app has a large library of musics, sound effects, stock footage, and several refining features. One downside of the app is the impossibility for fine tuning. Other that all the aforementioned features make PowerDirector a fairly convenient editing tool for amateurs."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Works great. I've upgraded from the free version but this is my review from then ""it's doing what I want with minimal begging for money. Of course they have to push for money to some extent, you can't make something like this without looking for SOME return on investment."" I have no regrets on upgrading, I use this app frequently to make custom clips from online videos to share with my family and to make small home movies."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",1,"Really, Cyberlink? I'm honestly disappointed. My S21 Ultra 5G can do everything that this app does, for FREE. I've been with Cyberlink since PowerDvD first came out and I'm honestly shocked and let down. The filters and even the color options are identical to my phone. Clearly, some of these elements are ripped from Samsung. Even upscaling does nothing except change the resolution. No improvement whatsoever. No reason to try OR buy üòî"

I'm tired of going back and forth between Kinemaster and this just to do a fade in and fade out. I'll up the rating once someone tells me how. Adding that as you can see above... From 2018....I PURCHASED this... And the app update doesn't recognize that. Still trying to get me to pay."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app for editing pics and videos. Thank you!"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"Mostly harmless.. Power director is pretty okay, with one or two major flaws. One, there doesn't seem to be a way to use your own music or SFX in the mobile app, and it there is there doesn't seem to be any documentation on how to do so. Two, the search engine for their on board music and SFX is hot garbage, in the META tab, search results have no relation to the query, and in their in house tab, there is no search bar."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"Overall, I enjoyed this app on my android. However, it is very annoying that you can only select one video at a time to import from Google Photos to your project. It is unnecessarily time-consuming to add one video at a time. That was frustrating. On a different but related note, when I try to edit the same project on my PC, it is not available. When I tried to recreate that project, the PC version (PowerDirector) cannot access Google Photos at all-- only the hard drive! That's stupid..."

"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",2,"For some reason, I cannot figure out how to cut off part of the video and make it shorter. This app lets you add just about anything you want. But when it comes time to remove parts of the video or make it shorter. I don't see an option."
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"PowerDirector - Video Editor","Unknown",3,"PLEASE READ! I don't know what's happening anymore. Everytime I tried to download my video to YouTube, the app keeps kicking me out with no explanation. I removed as much data within, rebooted my phone twice, I even tried to backup on Google drive with no video preview. Whatever is going on, I hope this gets fixed ASAP."
