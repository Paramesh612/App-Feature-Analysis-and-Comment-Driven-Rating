"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"They have a 3.7 overall rating for a reason. The app, in my opinion, is not at all user-friendly. It's way too complicated. More than anything, their support sucks. Email only. 80.00 wasted. Do not recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Truly thank you! I am so grateful this is a free app. I am disabled and struggle with keeping numbers in my head and budgeting. This is the only free app that works for me. A little tricky to navigate at first but your YouTube instructional videos helped a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Removed it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Looks good. Please add alternate date views. I.e Aus in DD/MM/YY"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Used rocket money for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"App keeps on crashing. Website changes are not synced to app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please do bug fixed ASAP. I am struggling to reconcile my envelopes since last 15 months. Every time I open the envelope entry, the app crashes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best app for managing budgets. Really good and simple to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is hands down the best budgeting app, because all the others treat you like you are stupid. This is nice and clear, and customisable exactly how I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"An excellent all with only a few missing features. This app puts budgeting front and center, but it also allows you to track payees and to split transactions, among other helpful features. So many other apps were missing at least one feature. There are a few drawbacks. The account totals can take a while to update, which can be disorienting. Support for multiple currencies and the ability to attach photos to transactions would be helpful. Other than that, an excellent app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the perfect budgeting app for me. I didn't need an app that I had to put in every penny I made and every penny I gave out. I just needed one to show the money that I would normally be pulling out of my account to stick into envelopes such as food, gas and miscellaneous. The regular monthly bills such as electric, mortgage etc. get pulled directly from my account already. However, you could easily use this for every penny if you wish I just don't need that"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a beautiful app. Do just what it's supposed to do. Very easy to use. Using this app for almost 3 years. The free version is good enough for most people I guess but if one is able should definitely purchase premium. A must have app for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Edit: 5 stars Goodbudget is a really good budgeting app. I use the free version since my budgeting system is simple, and it allows you to sync two devices and also access your account on your browser, which is a great feature. It is also very easy to add transactions and it only takes me a couple of clicks. I would give Goodbudget 5 stars if it had the option to assign a category (or tag, or whatever you call it) to each expense and generate spending report for it. Overall, the app is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crushing and it has been doing so for a long time. I've been using it hoping that an updated version will come, but it never came."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You need an account now. No reason to use this data selling scam of an app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Prices are too high...One time payment option is also not available.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"A lot more to improve"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I can't use for multiple devices .... I thought we can use this app by entire family members on same account...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I am a premium customer, yet why su h pathetic user experience? Addi g an income and dividing it into envelope is lot lot harder with app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"didn't quite scratch the itch"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great to have envelopes system"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that it let's you have multiple instances of a household on different phones - really helpful for shared expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Setup is confusing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"What just happened? I had been using the app for a while and had a lot of info/numbers saved in it and now suddenly I can't access the information and it's asking me to log in or create an account and start over??? Where is my info I had already saved??? Horrible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Pros: don't need an account + easy and fast to log a transaction + love the all envelopes view where you can see where you should be at and where you currently at with your usage for that envelope cons: - don't enable the calculator data entry, can't remember if it was the default option - confusing to edit the envelope capacity each month or like add money to an envelope as a one time thing Overall a super great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If your new to budget, this app helps you keep track and learn how to budget for your personal family finances. It may be the only tool that offers a reliable service for free but it requires additional pay to enjoy full service"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No guest option"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. I honestly can't believe how much it's helped me in staying on track. I tried other similar apps and deleted them. This one is so simple to use without unnecessary stuff and no ads. I don't use it with my bank acct so I can't say how that function works. It keeps my day to day spending in check. It's habit to use the app for every purchase that I'd be lost without it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. I having using it for years. It is the best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Free version: you can only have one account. It is helpful that you can use on 2 separate devices, but just about useless if you can only have one account..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Unintuitive, aggravating, requires payment. Maybe all the buttons for basic functions are behind the paywall, but I'm not going to try."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"BEST BUDGETING APP EVER!! I love this app so much. My husband and I got it not long after we got married, because we were spending more money than we actually had....this app has literally saved us sooo much money and it has been so incredible. We went a year without buying premium and it was great. Now, we want more envelopes, so have purchased premium. This app is SUPER simple and we have not had any glitches at all. Love it so much and would highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I created an envelope name and it was asking me Log in. When I wrote the name of the envelope, it rejected it. I got stuck there n therefore rewarded u only *."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Sorry, guys- I am not paying a subscription. I'm not looking for a free app; I'd be happy with a one-time payment."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app changed my entire outlook on money... quite literally changed my life. It is so much more than just a budgeting app. I'm being educated through podcasts, blogs, videos, and online courses, and through real-life stories, understanding my own behavior and how to change it to achieve what is truly important in life. I'll go as far as saying no matter if you are struggling with debt or if you need creative ways to save more, you need this app and this community. Get it now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You're limited to only ten ""envelopes"" each month, so you have to consolidate bills together, which kinda defeats the whole tracking everything idea."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very effective"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Looks like they're only releasing features for iPhone and not android, only bug fixes in over a year. Will add stars when they add features already released for iPhone 👎"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used this app a lot over the years so I finally subscribed. It's the simplest layout I can find that doesn't force me to connect to my bank"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying the app so far. Easy to understand and use! Thanks for the great app guys!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly at all on android phones"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it was a game changer for staying on budget, but I hate that when I scroll down in my transactions, it jumps back to the top. I have to scroll down twice for it to stay. And if I toggle between apps (my credit card app, for example, to add transactions to good budget), it jumps to back to the top again. Very frustrating when I am trying to determine which transactions have not been entered into good budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Subscription only. Can't manually input income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please fix your number entry form. Use the phone native keypad, anything is better than what you have know. I find myself trying to type simple numbers two or three times before I can get it entered correctly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My wife and I have used a competitor envelope budget app for over a decade. We recently realized that all the ""bells and whistles"" were making us complacent. We needed something simple but also a tool that requires a little work and the right kind of work. Budgeting software should help you decide what to do with your money today, not in some arbitrary future month that hasn't happened yet. GB meets that need for us. I'd give GB 5 stars if envelope groups were supported on Android."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app for money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Loving the app so far. Allows me to clearly see my budget to income ration. Only thing I wish it had, was to schedule income at different time, as not all my income come in on 1 date but throughout the month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Was excellent for many years. Now, software doesn't function properly to reconcile accounts. Misses transactions, can't reconcile. What good is a budget that can't be reconciled and duplicates or misses transactions?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Way too weird. Looks nice, but you can't even add repeat transactions.. hard to find my way around, and I'm a designer, so it not like I don't know how to figure things out. An almost there kinda app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The UI is so confusing and non-intuitive. Whenever I try to read how to do things, it always describes controls I can never find in the app. I get so frustrated every month trying to adjust my envelope amount because the app makes something that should be simple, super difficult to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so extremely helpful! I love the unlimited envelopes in the plus version but you can get 10 envelopes in the free version which is great if you want to keep it simple. An update I would love to see would be the option to scan your receipt when adding a transaction so you can see each item you purchased."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Stuck on register loop"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"We have loved this app and recommend to others. However, for some reason it has started duplicating transactions and now we can't determine the correct amount in the envelopes. Please advise."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No reason why you have to create an account. Does not fit my purpose or needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple budget/ expense tracking. Wish it would show amount you've spent and budget amount left along with total envelope budget. Or the option to pick the 2 you want to show. Options to change font sizes so ya can make stuff stand out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Works for envelopes but i cant compare my income against the total from all envelopes. Because my paycheck is a different amount every 2 weeks i need to see how much im short or have extra...still gotta do it on paper anyway"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This program has been invaluable for me! I have used it for years and now I pay to support the company because it is absolutely the best envelope budget program that I have found. It is worth paying for the account feature. Please note it does not link to your financial institutions it is a stand alone product that just helps you track your money. Thank you Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"not understand any app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps me budget exactly how I want to"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Before Goodbudget I used a spreadsheet to do the virtual envelope system. Not smartphone friendly. Now with Goodbudget it is easy to coordinate the budget within my family so we can stay on track. The only major negative is the absence of an automatic bank transaction sync feature to ensure that no transaction is missed, but (edit) as of December 2023 this feature is in beta testing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Please add more widgets. Like one that shows your balances, ect. Pleaseee!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Don't install"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Very confusing to use. No instructions or anything."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Infinite loop from the save 10 items or upgrade"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Please fix this damn behavior already that it starts from the last entry (top of the list) after each refresh. That happens now multiple times during an edit which is highly annoying and not productive. After 2 years, still not fixed... Just added 6 entries and now it is also forgetting in which category a store has to go although all went into the same"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and easy to use, love that me and hubby can both see balance easily. Been using this now for 6 years and love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Rather frustrating to use for a few reasons. You can't change your income at a later date to reflect income changes and you cannot open a different app - such as a calculator app - without any unsaved progress being entirely wiped out. I'm talking a 'start from square 1' level of data being wiped out. If you enjoy being fruatrated; this is the budget app for you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"La app me cambia los valores todos los meses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Bad UI, less features, too much manual labour"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Confusing. Great in theory. Horrible in execution."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Extremely not user friendly. Trying to type in an amount brings up a little mini number pad, but it doesn't input it into the budget. And trying to prioritize placement of the bills doesn't work"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"WIDGETEDBACKWIDGETED"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for free for years and it worked for me. I tried to add a new envelope and it keeps asking me to keep 10, I select the 10 I want to keep but the app won't sync and its become unusable. I'm sorry but I refuse to pay £6.99 a month. Looks like it's back to using paper ledgers"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sync not working and all saved entries went lost in the process. Deleted app & re download multiple times but just loading endlessly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Total spending hai Par total net worth nahi batata hai Only.monthly & yearly Please change your system Add total net worth When give 5 Star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app to track expense."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It's too buggy that it is unusable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to help keep my family budget straight across multiple family members on their devices. I love that the edits they make appear across all devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Poor UI. Difficult to navigate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Definitely not user friendly to setup. No real real guidance, and no obvious way to setup weekly or bi-weekly envelopes - only option is monthly or yearly which doesn't work for items like gas or groceries.. tried to sort it for 15 minutes..tried all the options and menus...then eventually gave up.... interface seems simple..but the options just are not there to properly setup the envelopes... why they aren't, or why it's not obvious apart from monthly or yearly is so frustrating annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I want to like it but stuff as simple as adding money to an envelope is super confusing and not at all intuitive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Bugs, lags, closes on its own."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It is asking to pick 10 envelopes for free, I did that still asking the same thing. Now I cant even go to envelopes screen and getting pop to pick 10 or Upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Only 10 envelopes free"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Soo frustrating! Where's the option for weekly budgeting?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Really makes budgeting easy. You can see real time where everything's going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"When I delete an income and press save it doesn't delete the income. Please fix. Would be 4 stars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Was going great. Subscribed for unlimited envelopes and now doesn't work at all. Things are deleting, not saving and income is duplicating."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I just figured out how to reset my budget period to every two weeks, so that's nice. But with that comes the fact that some expenses are monthly (rent, utilities, subscriptions) and some are weekly/biweekly (food, gas, fun). Right now with my budget period set to biweekly, I can't add monthly expenses. The options are biweekly or yearly, and you don't pay rent biweekly or yearly. It doesn't reflect my actual amount in my bank account. Please add a feature to accommodate this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Really like it however it deleted some of my envolopes and now i have to start again"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's a good app compare to others."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for Good budget plus account, but it's not allowing me to add accounts. I hope they resolve this soon, post which I'll edit my review."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Information manually entered BUT gives you much greater control over categorisation and reporting. Definitely pay the £55 per year for the Pro version. This app will help you save at least 20* that!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great simple app for budgeting! If you're looking for an app that helps you reach some financial goal this isn't the app for you, but if you're looking for something that's more like a digital ledger with some helpful graphs I would recommend this app for you! I've been using this app for a few years now and still love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like the app but I wish there was a graph for payees."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried to use this but, unfortunately, it limits you to 10 envelopes. Not enough!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Downloaded but keeps crashing when trying to allocate. Not useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this for about a decade. My wife and I refer to it daily. Great app. Super easy to use and very stable. Still supported after all these years. This is one of my top 10 apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried so many, love this one. Been using it for 5 months now. We just delete every month's transactions and start over because it tracks overspending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No option for fortnightly envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very Good UI and provides good budget features"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like this app a little bit. Pretty good for tracking expenses, but setting up the monthly budget/envelopes is very difficult for me. Trying to allocate my income to the envelopes is messy. Seems like to make a change, it takes me back to the beginning and I either screw it up or get duplicate allocations. It's hard for me to find the budget amounts and make changes. I'm frustrated with it right now. Edit; I've changed my review to 5 stars. Mostly because of their quick response to my comment."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Half the time the envelopes don't work right. I don't get the right envelope fill or I can't adjust their amounts. Why are my transactions pending? What is making them pend? Just fill them immediately. The app has some promise but it's execution is lacking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"What trash is this??? I've allocated money to envelopes! But when entering a transaction, it says negative!! Removing this garbage off my phone!! I don't know what the hell this app is supposed to be because it's clearly NOT a budget app!! Rubbish!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"App and widget keep crashing. Edit: I've given 4 stars because of the super quick response. However, I've reinstalled the app a few times but still crashing. Also still unable to set the widget on my phone. Will wait a while and try again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Scary"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Hard to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"As a budget app it's convenient however the fact that it wants to know my location for every transaction is extremely frustrating. It's not a feature that can be disabled and it prompts for every single transaction. If that is data that I have don't care to share, I should be able to decline one and that be that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Ideal to organize and keep track of spending. User friendly, simple and efficient. Just started using it and I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have downloaded and checks several apps trying to find the right one and this is it. FANTASTIC you don't have to link your bank account. You can have a main account balance which you purely manually deposit money into. They use a old system of envelopes for each budget, but these are imaginary envelopes, each one for a different budget, you add money to them, from your main balance. It paces your spending by telling you if your overspending and how many days ahead of the budget you are. FAB"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Will update after using some more"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really like this app and helps me stay in budget and see where my money needs to go"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"too expensive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App not user friendly and customer service is bad. It maybe easy to setup the initial envelopes and make entries, but if you plan on using this for more than a month-expect to be told to read their instruction manuals and watch the YouTube videos because simple answers are not available. All I wanted to do was autofill my envelopes past a month but the customer service rep/tech's basic answer was to ""go read the book."" Pfft..It was easier to put this all in simple spreadsheet on my Google drive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Very buggy. Graph is completely incorrect, doesn't show all envelopes. Unallocated sum is also incorrect. Useless as a budgeting app if the sums are incorrect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app used to be better but there have been no real improvements in years. Some features, like location entries don't work well at all. The current state would be fine but since I pay monthly I feel cheated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app is perfect. The layout is straight to the point. But the monthly income calculator is buggy. The math was wrong. It was heartbreaking bc that was the only issue. Even the layout of the calculator was easy to understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Made for members of a household. Not for individuals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Great concept but nightmare execution. I really really like the idea, but the whole adding and filling envelopes is a disaster, especially if you get paid biweekly don't even bother trying to set it up, you'll be left with nothing but a confusing mess. Sometimes a good old spreadsheet is all you need :)) Don't recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It still needs a lot of improvements."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This budgeting app is for people with extremely simple budgets. Will not work for anyone who actually makes money and has expenses. You'll get a better budget with pen and paper then this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It sucks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Refuses to let me add a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Its good but : you need to go to their website to setup some basic transaction like your Income. Functionality are not the same via the app and on the web wich makes the experience disappointing and not convenient to use. Also no possibility to add colour in the transaction list or to set up a couple budget with who paid what"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Downloaded on a whim one day, and it turns out Goodbudget is the easiest and most sustainable budgeting tool I have used. Highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Очень дорого за такой скудный функционал. Не советую"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for - simple and effective !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The only budgeting app that makes sense to me. Other ones I've used don't let you make categories and spending limits which is all I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crashed three times in five minutes of installing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The app feels backwards to me. Why am I filling virtual envelopes with money, then adding transactions to that when I could simply add my transactions and see the number I've spent increase instead of seeing my budget decrease? Seems counterintuitive to me, but maybe it will work for others."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps us manage our spending and understand where our money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have installed and uninstalled this app a dozen + times in the last couple of years. This is hands-down, my favorite envelope budgeting app. However, I really need it to sync with my banks accounts. Other apps are clunky and give me more info than I need. I always come back because it's simple to use, easy to understand, and my spouse and I can both have the app and see transactions we have manually entered in real-time, but we're always a week behind. Please sync with my accounts!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall great and exactly what I need to keep track of my money, but i really wish there were more budget period options. Example bills in 3 month periods or mortgage in 2 week payments options. (Also please just call it a fortnight haha) If the app developers implemented that, then it would be perfect in my eyes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great and customer service is fast and responsive. It is simple to use and has kept us on track and accountable with our budget. We have been able to see where we overspend and quickly adjust whether we budget weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. I highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Anyone else having issues getting it to sync?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like this app a little bit. Pretty good for tracking expenses, but setting up the monthly budget/envelopes is very difficult for me. Trying to allocate my income to the envelopes is messy. Seems like to make a change, it takes me back to the beginning and I either screw it up or get duplicate allocations. It's hard for me to find the budget amounts and make changes. I'm frustrated with it right now. Edit; I've changed my review to 5 stars. Mostly because of their quick response to my comment."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Last update 2020"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No UPI tracking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not user friendly for beginner. I couldn't figure out how to add envelopes and help options extremely limited"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I want to like this app but without bank syncing I can't use it. We simply have too many transactions to keep up with to do them manually. The concept is good but the features are lacking."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Fine but not customizable enough. Can't even specify a frequency for payment (only monthly or yearly, what if I pay weekly in installments?) edit: OK maybe I was wrong about that particular one, but unfortunately that was just one example."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's a simple envelope system . Not bad if all you want is the basics. Mostly its mental easing. The best is now $100 a year --- this is free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Couldn't see if it would work because it limit the number of monthly accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"There's no instructions. How do i add more envelopes for expenses. Seems like the app has potential but it's not there yet."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"fucclk"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Downloaded & tried to set budgets but nothing saved & updated despite doing it several times."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I'm not even finished with my envelopes but the app keep deleting them. Weird."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Intuitive interface, very easy to use. This is the first app i have rated without being prompted, i love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So helpful! - 2016 Still, so helpful - 2022 I started using the App back in collage. It is so versatile that 6 years and lots of life changes later I'm still a user. Will always recommend given the ocation. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Enjoyed using this app for the first month. However now I'm in month 2 and I still have not yet found a way to set the income to automatically refill. Hence, every transaction I now add is taking me further into minus figures. Very frustrating"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"While it let's you choose payperiod it doesn't not allow you to put in monthly bills so you would have to manually enter every bill I'm that payperiod for every payperiod. There should be a monthly option for bills and then the budgeted amounts that are bi weekly for gas and food."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The envelopes are after a year still difficult, but the overview and forms are great. But plus should be a receipe scan function in the app like other apps do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great idea to compete with YNAB. But doesn't compete fully without account sync. Same feature set otherwise from what I can tell."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great for single people. I just want to track expenses by category so I can enter them into quicken at then end of the week. This means both my wife and I need mobile access. Great it gives you 2 devices with free account. But when I actually sit at my PC to update quicken and balance my accounts, if I want to access my expenses on my PC on dual monitors for easy updating, now I have to upgrade to a $70/yr subscription. That's more that quicken costs me. I'll just keep using an Excel spreadsheet"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not what you're looking for. A monthly subscription fee of $8 a month unless you can manage with 10 envelopes. Clicking on unallocated balances crashes the app. Widget for quick entries looks goofy and low resolution. UI/UX is lackluster."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Does not allow you to add bills for bi-weekly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Don't Support Arabic language"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Is it crazy, 7000+ per annum for this app?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Hi There can the producers of GoodBudget maybe design the app in such a way that you can pay debt transactions inside the app instead of always going on the website. Also I notice in the transaction tab it shows all the transfers you do everything looks very untidy. With Ynab it has budget sheet and accounts and transactions tab in the middle. Can you make it similar and maybe let's reconcile expense transactions in the app like Ynab do. Trying to help your app become better giving ideas."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been trying to live off my unsupported YNAB app for years. Finally it died and I did research on what switch to. Good Budget has surpassed YNAB in almost every aspect. It's cheaper and more efficient. I'm really happy I went with it. Developers: please please change the transaction entries to include decimal points automatically so I just enter numbers. Don't make me enter a decimal point. This is really the only change I would want from this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple interface, easy to use. A great way for my wife and I to keep track of expenditures."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Confusing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied with current offerings, though the reports part could do a little better. Considering the goodbudget website already offers a lot of reports"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I paid for this app but it is extremely glitchy. Numbers don't add up and a budget app that can't add is pretty useless. I also wanted to clear everything and start from scratch because I hadn't used it recently. And it was nearly impossible and even after clearing all I had to try and figure out how to manually delete stuff."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Perfect for my needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Big fan of this app. Good app. I love having an overview of my finances and being able to save for different things, and being able to see all of it on one screen so I don't get lost in the sauce"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Using this for years now. Consistently has provided an error free and smooth experience."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"И зачем тут надо регаться?)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to keep my spending in check. Love the little happy/sad envelopes based on my spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Missing much comparing to other apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Time wasted on how to make it work…"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This was a wonderful app. I was using it regularly for more than a year. Now since past 2 months everything is out of sync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Edit for 2022: still amazing! Thank you for this app. Original review in 2020: Phenomenal app which employs an ingenious budgeting methodology. Really impressive!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I downloaded and set up the app only to find that it only supports one account on the free version. And I can't find information about how much the paid version costs. I can't tell if it's a better fit than the app I'm trying to replace without using it, but I don't want to commit to an expense I'm not sure about. Disappointing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's alright. I think it needs more updates. My screen keeps saying ""we had a problem but we'll try later"" something like that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, the only thing that is missing for 5 stars is when you transfer money between accounts, would be nice to have an option to transfer in to the multiple accounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is the best budgeting app I have used. So simple to control your money. The only issue I have is a lot of my envelopes don't automatically update each month and I have to go on the website and do it manually."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I don't get how it works. Why can't I put into the app the amount that I spent? Why can things be edited or opened only on the web? Really confusing. Spent an hr trying to figure out how to minus a spent amount out of an envelope. Still can't figure it out. It just adds the amount I spent TO my envelope, which defeats the entire purpose of a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Does not offer fort night budget. I have some items that get paid fort night while some monthly and other quarterly. This app only assumes a monthly budget plan."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Ui is sort of confusing to use and honestly pretty ugly. Also the fact you can't do credit card payments and transactions on the app is ridiculous. Wouldn't really recommend paying for this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Add weekly period"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only 10 expenses a month.. lol that's not enough, & if you want more it's $69.99 a yr, that's insane greed. Uninstall"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I've just purchased and so far its not very intuitive. I'm spending hours trying to figure it out. The tutorial and user guide are way too high level."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This one is not for me.. Try it, maybe it's something that you would like, but I just don't."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Terrible- had it for just a few hours. The income kept doubling every amount I put in and would show as two incomes for the same amount. Threw the budget off by changing my estimated earnings (doubling) and miscalculating amount remaining."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Doesn't have weekly, onky monthly and yearly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Loving the concept and simplicity of this app BUT... I've noticed a few places where the numbers are completely wrong, so I can't trust the numbers which are essential for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App seems to be good with no problems but you have to pay to have more than 10 envelopes which is ridiculous. I'm trying to save money not spend more, what a joke."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"2022 When I try and add weekly income it fills up all envelopes to the Max even though I haven't even got that much income. I want to add income as I receive it and split evening amoung envelopes or select which envelopes to fill The app Needs a god update to make it more functional ......................previouly: Would really like the option to budget monthly but paid weekly & to split any extra money into categories. Another thing this is missing is having a focus on savings."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app has changed my budgeting habits wildly (for the better) and I love it. My only suggestions would be 1) To bring the mobile app on par with the web version and 2) To add support for multiple currencies (even with manual conversion rates would be fine)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great. Very simple. I tried about 10 other apps and this one works best for me. I wish it had a weekly option so I could budget a bit more in depth. But, that's the only improvement I would suggest. I also love the convenience of the widget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Oke"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Didn't fill my envelopes and I can't figure out why. I just want it to add a $100/monthly (doesn't matter where the $100 is coming from) to the envelope, but when the 1st of the month came around it didn't do it. And it's way too complicated to figure out how to make something that simple happen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I thought you could actually transfer money from bank to envelopes, they need to have an app tht does that"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I really like the envelope idea, the only problem I have is that I try to budget per check, and pay bills based on what half of the month it is, and there's no options to fill the envelopes based on which check I have. The idea is great but living check to check is how I'm getting by, an this just isn't cutting it for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Needs instructions. I can't figure out how to set up an envelope for income or for a yearly expense - or honestly any expense. Any time I try to make an envelope it tries to make a new income and doesn't let me pull from the income envelope it had me make to begin with."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For those that complain only some of the features are free, I would like to see how you would react if you spent your time developing and creating something only for people to complain they have to pay for it. Do you go to a store to purchase a good and complain the store is charging you for it??? I pay for the features of this app because it helps me manage my money. That is a small cost to pay compared to the return I have with more money in the bank. Easy to use and packed with features!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"No scheduled transactions unless I upload my personal details to god knows who."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Only 1 account and 10 free envelopes. Plus, when adding new income, then adding x amount to envelopes and scheduling it, it doesnt appear in the transaction history of the envelope like it would if you scheduled credit and split it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect The only thing I wish this did was: When your filling envelopes from an income, I wish it took a tally of how much income is left as you fill each envelope, so I can see easily how much I have left to put in envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Simple to use and I've never had an issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good basic functionality but a lot of rough edges: - account balance doesn't update after account transfers entered until returning to the account page - draft entries in forms often get cleared when switching to other apps and back (very annoying when checking transaction details!) - occasional glitches when editing transactions For how simple this app is and how much they charge for a subscription I expect better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's okay, not ideal for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"2021-01J-02nd - Requires setting up an account before you can trial it. No thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Great concept, terrible execution. Important actions cannot be performed in the app and require a web browser. What's the point of the app if a browser is needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Only allows for 10 free envelopes, otherwise you have to pay. Won't allow you to change how much is in that envelope without deleting the envelope and redoing it. Not worth it if you have more than 10 things your budgeting for monthly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Switched from YNAB ( long time user) after their huge price hike. I researched a lot of apps and decided on ' Good Budget ', because it's comprable, runs seamlessly, has many clear instrucions to learn the app process. I couldn't be happier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far I really like Goodbudget! It's a reasonable price for the pay version and it's keeping me in line with my finances. Definitely recommend!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Used to work. Now wont let me delete account even on the web."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I ran out of envelopes and I'm not sure how to get more this app is silly I really don't like it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hi, Payment was debited twice from my bank but the app has not upgraded and I received an error message. Please investigate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Good Until Recently I load transactions from my bank acounts. It has been going well until recently - now any payments made on my credit card are added to the credit card account balance instead of decreasing the balance. Makes me wonder what other math is wrong. I'll be looking for an alternative budgeting application."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not much has changed since I've started using it some years ago. I like it and will continue to use it. But there are definitely little details and quality of life features that could be updated or added."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No user friendly. The app was impossible to set up kept adding up multiple paychecks so that I was making triple what I was making in one month and I just simply couldn't figure out how to add envelopes on which I guess represent monthly bills I found the app to be overcomplicated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love everything but the limit on the number of envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not easy to understand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. It's the only one that I've found that does the envelope system which really works well for me. I never quite understood other types of budgets and would rather pay for service than get consistently advertised. I would give it 5 stars when it can be synced to my account and lets me add transactions to envelopes instead of manually doing it and trying to figure what I missed if it takes a couple of days to catch up."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app ever I seen. Not able to change settings, cash mentioned randomly by app it self not able to delete or change it. If we want to change something All times it will redirect to website No use of this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Unistalling because of the envelope filling bug (basically gives you an error or says try later every month when filling envelopes) 👎"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Annoyed.. not to.. straight forward"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Been using the application for a year, and will continue using it. Quite good tool for budgeting. It has one infuriating bug. It happens when filling any inputs in the application, and I switch from the application to another. For example when I want to check the exact sum of money spent from my banking application. Goodbudget empties/forgets EVERY single input I had already filled. It drives me mad every time. I would give four stars if this would be fixed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app on and off since I was in college back in 2011. It's extremely user friendly and easy to set up. I've never used the paid version, so I can't say if the extra bells and whistles are worth it. But it gives you plenty to work with in the free version if all you need is an easy way to track your envelope money. 10/10 do recommend to all my friends, all the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Some hicups when transferring bank details"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"very good application but report not working, i have a problem in incoming and spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try it out before buying Premium. The minimal envelopes were annoying to deal with to trial. Finally, everything was set up. Once the new month began, it consistently displayed an error message saying it couldn't sync, so I wasn't able to add or subtract money from the envelopes. It's been a week and it still hasn't synced. This makes the app completely useless. Aside from the syncing, it would be great to have a limited time trial with unlimited envelopes to use fully."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Absolutely riddled with bugs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple & Great interface, easy to use, Does the desired job perfectly..!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app for over 8 years now and wouldnt change a thing. Its been saving me thousands a years which is great being a family of ten. Saves you the paperwork too, just wish at had a way where i can save my receipts than it would Heavenly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So far, I love it. Have just finished the initial set up and it's great! Thank you"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app , ugly widget, I hope the app gets more regular updates and the widget gets updated to match to a more upto date design"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Niether free nor simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"That's really very hard to understand and work with together, wst of the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love budgeting apps and have tried several. I found Goodbudget after I left a pro version of another budgeting app. I really like the ease of uploading transactions, find the esthetics of the app to be simple, and think it's a great modern way to do the good ol' envelope system. I recommend everyone to give it a try. Can't hurt, the free version is great and the paid version is risk-free. I also had a good interaction with customer service. He was prompt in responding to my email (24 hours)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I'm still waiting for my refund even after mailing them 3 times!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Bought the paid version at once, my bad, should have tried it first. Can't figure out how to delete transactions that came from nowhere. It says you can delete them on the web but there is no such option ughhh"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've used it now for a few years and are miles ahead in our finances. I would say the only real downfall is that if you're going through Goodbudget and rectifying it against your back statement, if you make a change to an amount, or add a forgotten one, it'll scroll all of the way back up to the top. It can be very frustrating if you're reviewing a whole month and it goes back to the top. Other than this, it's a great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Fast response. I figured out how to sync. Thanks for response. This app helped me change my finances. To syn you should enter transactions in the web and the app. The web takes priority over the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"App was okay free version didn't have enough envelopes for me so I moved on."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Super simple to use! A great way to use an envelope-based budget! Love the positive messages that pop up, and I actually enjoy entering transactions! I do wish it could connect to our bank account and automatically add transactions that way, like mint does."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Many better options available at much cheaper rates.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Really like this app. I like the visual that the envelopes give. A bit challenging to learn how to use it well, but getting the hang of things. I have NO IDEA why they would charge a monthly fee to use this though. I can see a one time cost to unlock more features (more envelopes) but it's silly to charge users monthly to keep features unlocked. Other apps have one time fees. To pay employees their wages, offer more services."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I would like a refund. This app will not sync and I cannot make any changes or actually use as a budget app because of this! Please cancel my subscription and issue a refund!!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Seems like a decent app, I've also used it on desktop before, however the mobile version has a bug that won't delete income sources, and then every so often it will clone them all, doubling income with no way to fix it, rendering the app pretty much useless for the time being"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"My husband and I have been subscribers for more than 5 years and we love this app. But we had to change to another app, literally because of one reason, their app limits to entering 8 digit number, we need more than 8 (because we are using other currency, not USD) . Not sure why they do that as we don't experience this in other apps at all. Contact customer service but their response is they will add this issue to the list and not sure about the time. Really disappointed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Debt payments... Income... You REALLY need to add features onto the app or what's the point... Plenty of other budget apps have it so I know its doable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app for keeping track of spending abd income. Pleasing to look at and easy to understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Coming back to edit this. We have now paid for the subscription for 2 years. Love this app. Can't recommend it enough."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best budget app out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Pointless. If it doesn't sync with your bank account, what's the point?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Does not give me a way to sign up, no information on how to sign up in help section. Only allows me to ""login"" but not to sign up😭"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sync doesn't work for over 4hrs now"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget tool! My husband and I use the basic free version to track our spending, and it's so easy to use. East setup, easy logging of expenses, and great reports!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sand send my good budget app to my home screen"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It is simple and provides the flexibility to budget the way I want. My spouse and I love that we can both see all expenses and we love having the app share how much we are ahead or behind. It makes budgeting anr saving feel like a game. I like not having it link to our accounts se we are responsible to enter all expenses. It keeps us accountable. Also, it provides the flexibility to budget the way we want rather than being tied to a budgeting program or method."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Have only used it for a week, will wait awhile before giving it a 5. Just finished the initial setup of our budget and tracked a few bill payments and expenditures. Can already tell this will be a great tool. Does everything we wanted my old excel book to do without the clunkiness and time consuming effort. Very intuitive and convenient. Free version is great for teaching kids to budget or just starting out, but love the expanded paid version for my wife and I with many account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No toycu"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Quite like this app I can allocate how much I budget in certain categories in how much I spend except the wish I could change it to fortnightly instead of monthly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very 1_20_2021 Educationally"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Lost data, couldn't sync to server. This wants to be a great little app. However, it lost all transactions on my phone when i forced a sync. Clearly the phone transactions never made it to the server, and the server transactions take precedence. That seems like the wrong choice for a mobile app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app lots and lots. I use the free version because $45 a year is a bit more than I am willing to pay for an app designed to help you be good with money. I wish it had an ""auto deduct"" feature. I have several bills that are automatically pulled from my banking account and sometimes forget to note it on the app. Absolutely no big bugs or complaints!! Update 2020; Upgraded to the paid version and it's worth the money to track all my bills and accounts easily. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been a subscriber for 3 yrs and LOVE it!!! Much better than my custom excel worksheet I was using, absolutely worth the fee for the plus version!! I like that it doesn't auto sync to bank accts. I wanted total control and manually entering everything makes me more aware/accountable of our spending. Easy to update budget/envelopes as things have changed over the yrs. After setting it all up, I now spend 5-10 minutes daily updating for transactions across all our accts, loans, credit cards, etc."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Doesn't auto fill envelopes with the amou t I set it to. It just says ""hm having trouble syncing to server"". Broken app. Can't believe I get used to using it for one month and then I found out at first envelope fill date it doesn't work"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Doesn't seem to do much ori just don't know how to use it and really it's not telling me home except to make envelopes for what purpose? I know what i spend. Just the list doesn't mean anything for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since it was im beta testing and used to be called EEBA (Easy Envelope Budget Aid). I have never felt the need to look for another personal finance budgeting app. The best thing about this app is that it is dead simple to use while having all the customization options that you'll ever need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Can't sync, big problem"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I downloaded subscription, deleted, and then decided to try again, and my phone says I resubscribed, but when I put in my email it says no account exists. 😩"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful envelope budget. Very good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Proprietary data, support did not help me export it. Recently they mixed in the U.S. presidential elections into my inbox. I didn't come to this app to lose data or for their politics."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Awful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only online. No offline options. Sync issues. Outdated UI. Many features missing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have now been using this app for 7 or 8 years (back when it was EEBA). I absolutely love it. My husband and I have it on our phones and can easily look and make wise decisions financially. We also have our own envelopes that we can spend money out of without talking to each other. That makes it nice when you just want to pick something up at the craft store. We literally saved over $30,000 and paid off our house in 7 years. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice budget app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Easy to uses it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Personal budgeting is a competitive market, so having an intuitive UX is crucial. Unlike competitors' products. Goodbudget is a bit onerous. The app, specifically, seems to lack features required for it to function as the website does. I tried to record a transaction I made by credit card and was directed to the website. I tried to record a transfer and couldn't. I'm not sure why the app can't handle those things, but I've had to stash receipts and enter them later, which I forget to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a good budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Okay okay. Nothing great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"was working perfectly for several years but of late it does not synchronize between entries made between multiple devices. my wife made entries that are not reflected on my device."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Features missing from Android version and is not as polished as the iOS version. It's an okay app the more I use, the more things I find are lacking."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Difficult to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If theres donate button, I think I go donate rather buy the plus version 😅"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"No support for recurring transaction (credit payment's) Update: you can schedule a recurring paymament but you cannot set number of months it will remain active."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"no import. no bank sync. no export even, apparently. totally lock in. the free version will be enough, until it isn't. it's as free as a free joint. at least there are no ads..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Used first time today. Seems well organised. I have a question. What will happen to surplus of a envelope at month end. What will happen to shortfall?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's seems like a decent app that will help me budget. Many positives, but one major problem... When I try to schedule the filling of the envelopes in advance, it shows the envelope fill and deposit right away. For example, I put in 8/6 as the date for the paycheck and envelope fill, but it shows immediately in my checking balance and envelopes. Why have the option for a future date if it shows it immediately? This will make reconciling my checking account with the app's balance more difficult."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Does this app allow actually linking my bank account so that it automatically pulls the data? It's too much to manually enter it each time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Very different from other apps. Takes sometime getting used to. Expensive subscription."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Need to setup an account just to use this"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The icon is so cute. i can have many envelopes, fill them up at start of the month, then monitor their usage, just like watching ur data usage. Thanks devs!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been incredibly helpful for my wife and I to stay on the same page with our budget. The only thing I wish it had was home screen widgets for individual budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Makes setting up a budget so much easier & keeping track of your money easier too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Sounds like just exactly what i was looking for. But i didn't use it because there was an another APP that provided an excellent feature. The app is called ""Walnut"". It recognises all my digital spendings by reading my SMS and records it automatically. Goodbudget might think of adding such feature."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has made personal finance for the last 3 years a breeze. Highly recommend purchasing the premium, it's pointless using the free version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app. I've been using it for years now. However, the app has never been updated and adding a decimal point to the value is annoying because there is no option. You need to swap keyboards while adding the amount."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I was disappointed with this app I was hoping to be able to add in all my information, with their frequencies and it be about the tell what that works out monthly, weekly etc. I can't even add in 4 weekly pay. Each envelope need to have its own frequency as well as amount and deadlines etc."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I'm confused. I entered $500 for my grocery but in the envelopes, it shows $1000. The same with the other envelopes. the amount I enter gets doubled in the envelopes. is it supposed to work that way?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Goodbudget is a good web based envelope budgeting system, but this app needs a lot of help. Basically, you'll need to use the browser to do various functions that the app can't."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This app works in the opposite way that I need to plan. I want to enter ALL my debts first, their due dates, interest rates, and minimum payments. Then I want to enter each bill, it's due date, and amount owed. THEN AND ONLY THEN DO I WANT TO ENTER AN ENVELOPE FOR A PAYCHECK. Because as far as I am concerned, anything else--food, gas, groceries, gym, misc--that's off the table until my debts are allocated for, then bills, then extra to make extra payments on the debt. Not buying food until then."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I didn't even get to try it, only gives you 10 spots for your items. I need a detailed budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Honestly the best budget app that doesn't sync with your bank account. Was a bit of a struggle in the beginning but now that I've figured things out it's amazing. Having a we version that syncs with your account is also nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the envelope system. It's intuitive to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for years now and it is the best!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Feedback"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how this app can help me track my real-lifr envelope budget system. I highly recommend this app to help you guys who want to do very doable budgeting system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We are thinking about doing the premium but we'd like a trial period first. Wish you guys offered one loke most of the other popular budgeting apps do..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"So confusing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too confusing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not for me but I think it could be very helpful to others"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little confusing, web version is better, I hope there's a period for free to experience the premium version so I can know whether it's good to invest. However, this is a good budgeting app, keep on improving it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's ok. But I am trying to budget. Not add to my expense. So I'm going to uninstall and find an app that is free and better suited for my family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Put on some clown make up because the ""help"" button is a joke. It just touts their premium version of the app when I tried to get help because it is not a very intuitive app and I was willing to learn. But you just want me to pay premium if I want any help."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"So far it is okay, but I cannot seem to seperate my income rate - every 2 weeks, and monthly bills. The bills will only set up for every 2 weeks like my income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really really like this product and used it for a few years. However, I stopped because they don't allow for splitting by percentage, which is more useful for me who has variable income. So I'm waiting patiently for this update to come back."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Is it possible to have 2 households connected in one email account (one with my gf and one for myself)? I've asked this in the email address provided on your website but haven't got a reply almost a week now. Also, do you need to pay the full upgraded version to add a credit card? Please let me know. I found the app pretty useful in the tutorial and will definitely reconsider redownloading it if I see my queries solved. BR Vangelis"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have tried too many apps before and found this one to be the most effective. Been using it for 5 years now and is still the best app I would recommend to manage your finances!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app ever!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really want to use this app with my partner, its exactly what we've been looking for - the problem is that while my partner, who uses an iphone, can set her envelopes' budget periods to be every two weeks, I dont have the same option on the android version of the app, only monthly and yearly! Its very annoying, and preventing me from using it effectively as my income is fortnightly - are there plans for this option to be added to the android version of the app too?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Way too complicated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Unable to sync across devices"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"How in the world are there so many budgeting apps that don't have an option to allocate by percentage! It truly boggles my mind!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So happy I found Goodbudget. I have tried many different solutions and none of them to work for me. This is perfect for what I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No instructions?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app but I would like to know how to use it more effectively . I can't seem to tick off what I have paid in monthly expenses . So my income balance always shows a plus amount. It's not a realistic reflection of my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Do not like interface or how the system is set up - not very user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The desktop website is great. However, the Android app is sorely lacking in features. The app completely ignores envelope groups, unlike the website which groups the envelopes in both the reports and in the envelopes list and allows you to collapse groups you don't want to see temporarily. I wish I could filter the envelopes on groups and filter transactions on accounts in the app. If I click on an envelope in the reports, I wish to see the corresponding transactions in that time range."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Way to glitchy. Not user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Plain simple, non competitive and surely lacking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to get budget in order"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Too complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Love the browser version but this App is seriously lacking. Can't see envelope balances when filling, splitting charges is a nightmare. The list goes on. It's like no one who developed the app ever actually tried to use it. It would be 1 star if I didn't like the browser version so much but seriously considering switching due to the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best budgeting app, above all others. Only down fall is no Bank synchronization. Its all manual."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"All of my information was erased because I didn't make an account. Now my budget has to start from the beginning."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have high hopes for Goodbudget (GB) & me. I had EEBA but can't remember why I stopped using it (got distracted?). I have no desire to interview other budgeting apps. GB seems to be helping me in my 3rd week! Although I'm scratching my head that the widget isn't in the widget tab of my Galaxy S2. ..... UPDATE 8/11g14: I have the widget! Moving the app from the SD card to the phone solved that! (Thx Steve! ) Dark theme is great! Easy on eyes. Green stands out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app and I love that it doesn't insist on syncing with my bank account. When I write a check, I can take the money right out of my ""envelope"" without waiting for the recipient to deposit it. Likewise, when I take out cash at the ATM, I don't have to take the money out of my ""envelope"" on the app until I actually spend it! Some might call it low-tech but I think it's a miracle"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I am new to it but liking this app so far. If I could make a suggestion I'd like to be able to add one time purchases or bills to help keep track of my money also one time income. Being able to account for every cent no matter if its a daily purchase weekly monthly annual or one time only it is super important to keep track of and easier done when you have it all in one place. Also I love that it doesnt require my bank account information!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Still waiting for the bank/cc sync feature. Been years without it and I think I am going to end my subscription by the end of this year just because of that lacking."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only gives you 10 items so no good for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Really crappy to me.. much better apps out there that do much more"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"You only get 10 envelopes in the free version. Not helpful for people starting a budget. And the cycles are only monthly, which isn't helpful for weekly bills like Daycare expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for 'envelope type' home budgeting. It does require a bit of learning in the beginning, but it pays off, believe me. I only wish I could protect it with a PIN or something. I love the fact that I can use Web interface for larger use cases (editing accounts, envelopes etc.), and use my phone to enter everyday transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EDIT: See below for original. I emailed and they helped me with my problem straight away. Thanks so much! Started off well but payments into my budget keep getting stuck on pending (wth even is pending??? Serves no purpose in my use!?) And this time has been stuck on it for nearly two weeks. Pretty much given up on it as this makes it useless. Would love this to be fixed and will change my review if so. Thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped my husband and I to grasp our finances. The 'shared' application is really great because it allows us to update expenses separately but still both see our joint budget. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs help sticking to a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The app will not sync. What's the purpose of this app if it doesn't stay current?????"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried several budgeting apps and this is by far the best! I love the concept of virtual envelopes! The ability to split one transaction into multiple envelopes is such a time saver - it even calculates it for me! Love this app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I am confuse ...uninstall"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app that uses the envelope budgeting method. So much for rent or mortgage so much for groceries so much for utilities and etc... Helped me buy a house and a car. Very useful. Plus if you want to know if you paid a bill just look at what you put on your transactions history of not they're assume you didn't pay it if it never showed up in the bank. Useful for helping you learn where your big expenses are that are less obvious on a day to day basis (here's looking at your Starbucks habit)..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Unable to see price without creating an account. Unable to sync to private server (NextCloud), use closed-source servers. I love the envelope concept though. Uninstalling."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"So close yet so far away. I love the idea of the app. But there is so much missing. My income changes all the time and i just want to add my next pay in. And i am not paying a monthly fee for an app the doesnt do a thing for me. They have created an app. Walked away and want you to pay. This app is more of a one time deal. That is my deal breaker for me. And not a fan of writing estimate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app and works as expected. I would love to see multi currency support though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I used this app for 1year and really enjoyed it. However it suddenly stopped syncing between my phones and web app. I tried everything including reinstall with no luck, it just keep getting stuck on endless spinning icon without syncing. This is a really bad"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Please, merge Credit Card and Debt feature (read: allow expense transaction on debt in Android)? I am sure, a lot of first time goodbudgeter have credit card debt precondition. Please, help us get out of debt?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far, so good! Worlds better than Mint. I've noticed that many of the negative reviews have a common theme - if you're not already familiar with the envelope system, like used by Dave Ramsay/Financial Peace, please watch the helpful tutorial videos for this app. It will make all the difference!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Really outdated UI (entering numbers, for example, still uses an on screen calculator view instead of your keyboard). UI isn't necessarily intuitive, there set up steps aren't fully explained so I have no idea if it's doing what I think it's doing. Also, no way to see a month to month view. This is more of a snapshot of current month only. I think I'm better off in Excel."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Unable to sync since August"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I liked the app initially. App really helped a lot in saving -- I allotted an evelope for savings and app really helped me make if I was on track of my spending budget. I struggled with the app while making changes in my envelopes -- I had 4 envelopes when I started, then added a few more to divide my income (bad strategy, btw) -- when I noticed that my savings was not growing, I decided to delete envelopes and this is when app (or I) had problems with syncing. Help"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Disappointed. I used to use this a few years ago, so I started it up again. I have a lot more expenses now then seven years ago, more to pay for. Over ten envelopes though, and you have to pay for this app MONTHLY. I have too many bills to add one more."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not working for my budgeting. The monthly envelopes do not reset monthly. If i carry a balance month 1 it pushes forward to month 2... Completely messing up month 2's budget. Bad set up. Customer support was in contact with me. Stars changed. Hopefully next month it will work properly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What a great budget app!! Once you get the hang of it and learn how to use it, it helps out so much!!!!! Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"seems great, but it hasnt synced once since i downloaded it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Doesnt allow Fortnightly or Weekly budget envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"simple and useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app to use to know where you are at with your budget while on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it!! Much better than MINT. Simple but powerful app to track finances. You have to enter transactions manually, but setting up the budget is easy and I love the ""envelope transfer"" feature. Just because ""going out"" budget is empty doesn't mean you can't go, the money just has to come from another category. Great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"No option of adding income through Android app.Please fix it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good, useful app but I think its time for an overhaul. I think it needs a new look and added features, or make them clearer at least, such as splitting transactions between envelopes or moving money among envelopes. Again, good functional app but needs a bit of an update"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"helpful app for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"App is back up and running as expected again. Thanks for the developers reaching out and helping to resolve the issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Terrible, unusable app. App constantly crashes, doesn't sync with server, a whole consortium of other glitches. I spent an hour setting it up... will be uninstalling. This app clearly hasn't been properly tested. Also, 'filling' envelopes is not needed, it is confusing. Think it would be better (and simpler) if the app only tracked income vs categorized expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not as useful as it once was. They removed useful functions like the ability to add different sources of estimated income (or at least they hid them deep down on the web interface) and added features like reports. extra features like that aren't un-useful, but also aren't at all necessary on what's supposed to be a digital version of the envelope system. It would be better to spend that effort on essentials like *Knowing How Much Money You Will Have*."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Love the envelope option. exactly what i was looking for.i wish it linked to bank accpunt so transactions could be linked to envelopes.( without a cost)lease make this option and app wld be perfect! so far ive only fou d one or the other in apps :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using Goodbudget for several years and it has been a game changer. We close on our first house in a few weeks and are almost out of debt except for our mortgage! Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"very sad that the free version only off 20 spaces total. makes it difficult for anyone trying to break down a whole budget to reduce spending overall :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app....I can keep track of almost everything and I kinda know where I stand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"exactly what I wanted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and convenient app. Keep budgeting and expense track in one. I like it. Rejoice for your great idea."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budgeting app for cross-platform use. both my iPhone-using wife and my Android-using self can finally find a way to keep out budgets in sync without a snag. Free to use and most basic functions are available in the free version. Must have if your trying to use the envelope system (either hypothetically or physically). Keep up the good work guys!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is everything that Im looking for. Thank you 💕"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Good app, but $50/yr for more envelopes is too expensive. $20/yr would be reasonable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app, you get so much for it being free! I just have a question, I get paid fortnightly (death of all maths budgets) what is the best way to load monthly expenses on a fortnightly budget? I've tried using goals and I've tried dividing the difference into two forrnights but it never works out, please help? (I prefer a fortnightly budget over a monthly budget)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I'd like to give this app a higher rating, but I feel so demotivated when I go ""under budget"" (which I'm not, but I only have so many envelopes and it's confusing to refill if I need to adjust amounts in each since I'm only starting my budgeting process) and the app says ""boooo in the red"" or ""negative money, interesting..."" That's not motivating me to be better, it's motivating me to uninstall this app and definitely NOT pay for anything within it. Positivity would go a much longer way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Weekly? It great to look at things from month to month. However, I need to be able to look at things from week to week. You cant set a weekly budget. uninstalled for this reason. If there is an update or a change, I will be back."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for 5+ years. It's an uncomplicated way to track our ""shopping"" for groceries, gas, kids commission, & fun money. I also have Mint but use Goodbudget to keep our ""shopping"" in check."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally have savings and know where my money is going!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Gets the job done. The UI experience is pretty annoying though. Really would like to see Debt tracking and contributing extra to an envelope lowers the debt goal. They have debt tracking but the experience is so bad that I don't even want to spend the time to learn it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"l tried it. i need a shorter budget cycle of every 2 weeks to match my pay cycle. this only have options for monthly or annual."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm very impressed. I used to be worried and wouldn't let myself spend anything because I didn't know what I had and how much I needed to save. But now I know exactly how much I have to spend and it is very freeing. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Essential. it's great to have a mobile and desktop application"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using Goodbudget for several years now, and it's been so helpful for keeping track of my money. I've been able to notice trends in unnecessary spending to cut back and save for things like vacation and fun, and to give toward causes I support. I love how goal envelopes help me save for long-term expenses. And with scheduled transactions, Goodbudget takes care of my regular payments and fills so I don't have to. The plus subscription is worth it to have unlimited accounts and envelopes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Have used this for years happily. But the latest update broke the app in a subtle and very disruptive way. Downgrading to 1 star. Very disappointed. Am a longstanding customer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Updating my review... Again, I've used this app for about 4 years and I find this to be the BEST for managing my money. Easy to use, and easy to manage money, 6 stars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app for the job for me, and I tried a bunch. This was the one that matched best my budget style. Can only say it would be nice to have another theme or two to use, rather than just white/green. Dark theme is too extreme and hurts my eyes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too complicated. Too many issues trying to edit envelopes. Some envelopes not filling up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app, but the limit of 1 account for the free version is not very useful. Please increase the account limit to at least 3. Other than that it's a simple and good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Update 20190420: The reporting feature alway shows the same figure for spending regardless of the period selected; Reports are busted. Can use .csv files for importing transactions, but is very cumbersome depending on the source file. Update 20190329: This app is just too cumbersome to use. Stop and fill out every time I make a stop on my runs? I guess. Then cross check with my accounts to find stuff I forgot? What a bear. Then they came out with a WONDERFUL idea to import transactions. I LOVE IT! Small problem; they use the post date. Seriously, the post date? That has no relation to my receipts or my spending recollections. The transaction date, man - c'mon. Well I guess at least they tried.   2017 - I just have no complaints. Syncs flawlessly. Has done so consistently over a year. Web version works identical to mobile except I can only quick fill my budget from the desktop app. If I could do that from the mobile this app would have a perfect score. Has done fantastic things keeping the family budget in line."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"hard to setting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"very helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"If I could rate this zero I would. After crunching my numbers and setting it all up it never sync up info from my end and eventually crashed loosing everything. Worst app I have ever used."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only one account can be created in Free mode. Well that ain't satisfaying at all to encourage for a premium. Uninstalled in 2 min."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great overview"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its a brilliant app, helps me handle my expenses in the best way possible. Taking the star because widget isn't resizable and could be more aesthetically pleasing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice! dark theme 👏"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Ive used this app for years now. Its just become more frustrating than anything else. The app no longer keeps upto date totals of envelopes properly. For example, I will enter a $10 transaction and the envelope, which had $50 in it, will continue to say $50 even though in the list of transactions in now says $40. This also affects the total displayed for a class of envelopes. Obviously this is frustrating as I will sometimes think I have more money allocated than I actually do. Changing apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app works most of the time, but it occasionally glitches and messes up the amount i have in each envelope. For example, it removed all the records of my Envelope Filling, so all my envelopes are in the red despite spending less than i have filled. I was not able to fix this. Also, i set my envelopes to be filled at the end of each month, but after February, the envelopes filled on the 28th. I cancelled the transaction and re-set the date, but the envelopes are still filled up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"budgeting reflects our priority"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"looks good and like the ui and sync feature. But no weekly/fortnightly budget option!? derp."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the most practical and useful budget tracker app. in one word, its Awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"not very intuitive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's okay but... I want to track my expenses without putting in my income and that option isn't there. if i don't enter income everything shows in negative. Also, there's no clear instructions how to share it with your partner. Can you help with these things?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Seems ok at set up, but I am paid 4 weekly. I would like to see this as a default period otherwise I will probably just end up uninstalling the app. Also some budgets have different payment periods so I need to set some budgets for weekly, some 4 weekly, and some for monthly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great product. I've used it for years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Very intuitive and effective. Most of the famous one tend to be overly complicated. This one does expense tracking very well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We always come back to this app for budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It does ok...but the system has so many little glitches that filling envelopes from a new paycheck each month is a 45 minute ordeal of filling, undoing, redoing, stopping to take deep calming breaths, then trying one last time before deleting the app and trying mint...before it finally (mostly) works."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app among all the ones i have tried... love it... my wife and I shared the access so we know where we are at all times"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. We use it with my wife to stay within our budget constraints."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Since the latest update, I can't use any commas in my transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good but it is having serious troubles syncing :// Customer service is fantastic though, super nice and helpful. Working on getting it fixed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"excellent budget and one planning app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The concept is great but the app failed on multiple occasions ever since i downloaded it. First it always fails to sync quickly so any changes I make will not be reflected on the app at all. Secondly, sometimes when i key in the amount for my budget it registers that amount for expenses instead of allocated budget, therefore it shows i have a 0 in that budget but I spent money within that envelope. Faulty system. Hopefully the appmakers can pay attention to this problem and fix it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"update: Online setup is much easier. Just getting started, but so far so good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn and very useful. Makes it easy to monitor spending and save up money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best App for My Family I had used Goodbudget for a few years, and quit using it to try other budget apps. I tried at least 10 different apps and nothing compares to this one. Most of the other apps were hard to figure out and didn't allow split transactions. I'm glad to be back to a very user friendly atmosphere."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is a great app. However, since a recent update on a new phone it keeps prompting me to grant permission to access my location. I see I'm not the only one with this problem. It's really annoying, so I have to downgrade my review for now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"nice set up, but I'm not paying $50 per year for more 'envelopes' I'll find another app that'll help me track my spending that is truly free, like Mint"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using the paid version for a short while now. I am transitioning from Quicken 2017. Quicken has been bloated and buggy for some time now. I finally couldn't take it when the Quicken sync began only working in one direction causing me to constantly track down register errors. Goodbudget seems to work great and is straight forward both on the PC and mobile. In short, it works great! I've been using GB for a few months now and couldn't be more pleased. *update Jan '19* Still great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"easy and simple and does the job."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"2019 update: I'm a paying customer and hate to do this, but I'm downgrading my review to 2 stars now. It's been a 5 star app for years, but now suddenly they've started prompting me to allow location access every time I add an expense. And even though I've declined it dozens of times, and disabled location features in the app settings, it just keeps asking me over and over. This, and every app like it, are obnoxious. Apps like this don't have any business asking for my location!!!!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Suddenly the is malfunctioning! Entered a phone payment and it wouldn't deduct it also other totals randomly began to change! Uninstalled / reenstalled but it still screwed up. Hope you can fix it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not enough features to really help budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Mantap lah buat ngurus budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app overall, a bit confusing to use at times but I like how specific it can get and that it gives me a clear idea of my budgets. Would be great if I could fill envelopes on a fortnightly basis, rather than just monthly. Then I can schedule each of my paycheques."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I've been using it since 2016 to monitor and manage our household budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ideal budgeting app. I don't want complications, and connection to a bank account, or help with setting up a budget. I need a simple way to keep track of monthly spending with my spouse. This App is absolutely perfect. Kudos."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful for creating a budget and tracking expenses. I wish I could get more envelopes, though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budgeting app. However bugs affect it's productivity. For example a particularly serious bug is when the report function omits whole categories in spending, giving the user extremely misleading information which defeats the whole purpose of budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Paid for subscription. Sync doesn't work. App keeps saying to try again later. Few days later ... still not synching. Wrote to support as a PAID SUBSCRIBER. No answer. Don't pay for this app. I want my money back. App does NOT work and neither does support."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"..but I got there eventually and works for what we need. I told all my friends about it. I especially get excited looking at our goals andhow much money is in or knowing for certain when one debt will be fully paid. I love that my husband and I can both access the app and see how much is available to spend where"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app is pretty cool. when u get a new salary, u should be able to automatically distribute them into the envelopes we already created. Otherwise, it's a manual and tedious process every time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Okay so I set the budget, but why are the envelopes filled already? I'm just setting my budget. When I get paid on Wednesday, then I want to fill my envelopes to fill. I'm reading a book that suggested this app, but this is much more confusing. I'll just keep being complicated and using my spreadsheet"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great improvements with this version!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Monthly/ yearly subscription what a joke"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I'm using the paid version. I'm really enjoying it and it's such a big help. My only suggestion is if there's a way to hide the savings account from being included in the ""total"". I do a monthly deposit into my savings and like to consider the money as spent so I'm not tempted to dip into it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent for straight forward budgeting. Using it to help my 11 year old learn to manage money. Am glad it does not require linkage to a bank account, as he is not ready for that yet."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app is good for keeping track of household finances but I find the reports useless. Being able to see things like what your average spend is on a daily basis would be useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Very helpful way to budget/monitor finances. Definitely worth all the time it takes to set up and hone your budget. Note: Quite a minor thing, and may be just because of the old phone I'm using, but it's annoying that every time the app updates i lose my widget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Needs to add ability to set end date/number of occurrences for scheduled transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using this app for about 3 years. It's wonderful. It takes some getting used to and figuring out how to get it all set up, but once you do it's a breeze to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if you could add emoji symbols like: 💵 💡 🚗 🏡 which I add after the payee name to make it easy to spot on the account list.... ✌️ Another thing, having the app remember the list position when in the account so it goes back once you save a new entry. Right now it goes to the top of the list which sucks if you have a long list of items. And being able to highlight the latest balance line in gray."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loved it! Tried a lot of budgeting app but this is the only one that works with my budgeting style. I love that it's very much like a cash envelope system so it's easy for me to reconcile and see if I'm over my set budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a lifesaver. I've used a few budgeting apps. This one keeps evrty th ing simple and at a glance I can see everything I need. I can even plan year long goals. Christmas had a plan emergencies have a plan. Gold."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app I have ever used. A recent update added multiscreen support. A++!!! It was a major needed feature I and others requested on there support forms. They really do listen to there customs! Now if I could custom a from to a to day on the report in the app like i can on the webpage, this app would be perfect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Frustratingly glitchy but the best app I could find for budget tracking!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App itself looks nice, but there is 0 information on how to use it at the beginning and at the e-mail & password screen there is a back button but app doesn't alow me to go back. Ever. Even if I killed the app I can't restart. Which is very disturbing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Hypocritical. To unlock enough ""envelopes"" to meaningfully track your finances, you need to pay them a recurring annual fee of $61.99. That's a ton of money to pay for an app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this to track my envelope system so I don't have to actually use cash and envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thankful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easier than real envelopes. My husband can now stay in the budget loop. I don't have to worry about losing an envelope of cash while I'm out shopping."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budgeting app, but I'll have to deduct one star because of a glitch with the sync function. I had to start from scratch using a web browser on my computer before it started syncing properly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easiest budgeting app I've found. Been using it for several years and it just keeps getting better"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not able to login form android 9 app. Above was my initial review and within 24 hours I got reply and issue was fixed. I really appreciate prompt support and concern for users. I am sure will come back to give this app a five star."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is my checkbook and helps me plan how I'm going to spend my money 
(budgeting). I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a budget app that wouldn't require me entering my bank 
info and this one still gives me a good way to track what money I'm 
spending and taking in! I feel like I've become more conscientious of my 
budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that the account can be shared with the entire family 👪"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Can't rename envelopes, stupid. I don't want a whole bunch of unnecessary 
envelopes or have to pay for more when adjustments are made..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Been using since 2011"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using the good budget app for years to track spending and I 
love it. The user interface of both the android app and website make it 
easy for me to fill my envelopes each month and track my expenditures."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An easy to use, simple app to get on top of your budget. I recommend the 
pro version as the added features make it well worth the expense monthly - 
just make sure you budget for it ;)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice work on the Andrid app and I appreciate the restoration of the support 
for the older Android systems. Cannot afford buying new mobile devices so 
often."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what my husband and I were looking for ti tank or spending so both 
of us can see it all in one place."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used another expense manager for years, but it lacked the web 
interface and ability to sync multiple devices. GoodBudget had a small 
learning curve to find the best way to use it for what I need, but after 
about an hour of playing with it, I got it and it has worked great since. 
Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great app for bring on top of your accounting. A pity you can use all 
their features via online only. But their widget and accessibility via 
phone is great! Been using it for 4 years now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use free version, but still really useful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app would be fantastic if you didn't have to pay to use it. I guess if 
you have no bills then it's fine but once you get over five or six bills 
then you have to pay for it and anybody who needs a budgeting app probably 
has more than six or seven bills a month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Helped me get my life sorted!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There are a few finicky pieces to it. I like it the most of apps I've seen 
but still has bug or two here and there. Sometimes the calcultor types 
weird and the web version (which I use mosy) doesn't have a very good UI."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy, simple and extremely useful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time and it keeps me on track. That's all i need!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I especially love that the app is synced online so my wife and I can keep 
track of stuff that we both buy and it will update the others phone too! 
We've been tracking our purchases and income religiously for the last year 
and a half. These days we can track how much money we have at any moment 
down to the cent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Being able to share the household budget makes it very usable, and has been 
very reliable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app and how it helps me keep track of spending and identify 
areas where I'm overspending. Would love it even more if there was some 
sort of widget or feature for me to remind myself to add a transaction. So, 
when I check out at a store I can do something quick on my phone, like just 
enter the name of the store and/or the amount, and be able to finish all 
the details later when I'm not standing in someone's way at the till. 
Thanks for a great system and app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I can find that works for us. We've tried mint, and ynab."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and very easy to use. We were up and running in minutes. Exactly 
what we were looking for. Great features in the free version (I'd even pay 
for it). Appreciate the web version and sync feature to my and my wife's 
phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like the ability to make one transaction split into multiple envelopes. 
This has helped my family in numerous ways."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app meets exactly what I need when it comes to budgeting and tracking 
of expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It really helps me to focus my money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Support is also wonderful they fixed app to support my older 
device. Have been using for years back hen they were EEBA. Best envelope 
budget app out there!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app for everyone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Great when it works, but there are consistently issues with their servers 
being down. Get better servers or make the app asynchronous. When I can't 
use your app 5% of the time, it's obnoxious"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what you need to keep track of spending category-wise. Sync is 
great for husband wife use. Most needs covered in free version itself"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple effective budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No budgeting app has ever been so easy to manage my finances... My finances 
were out of control before I started using it. The paid version is worth 
it... I have an envelope for each individual bill. Even each person for 
Christmas. I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's good but I downloaded the app something like 3 or 4 years ago and it 
is still exactly the same as that time. Zero improvements and I ensure you, 
there could be made loads."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The layout is simple to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budgeting and tracking expenses are so easy with this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my wife and I on the same page with our budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome been with it since 2014 never looked back on it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Outstanding, intuitive app. Great for my husband and I to track our 
spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is great tool. A very useful app so me and my hubby can both track 
down our income and spending every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"All is well!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what we needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me. See where my money is going and how to adjust on the fly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used it for a few years now. Works great and keeps me on top of things."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful for keeping to a budget. You can put as much detail into using 
it as you like."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great, keeps me on track with daily tracking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice one"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Amazing and great for a simple and slightly complex budgeting solution. My 
whole family uses this its awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and I'm not even using it to its full capacity. I 
highly recommend it to keep your finances on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A very berry useful app to help me make my monthly budget. My favorite!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super intuitive, provides clarity, can't imagine being without it! I use 
the paid version and it's worth every penny. I recommend this often to 
family and friends."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This would totally be Dave Ramsey approved."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This thing helps my wife and I keep track of all of our spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best way to see the budget big picture. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great format. Numbers rollover well. Only 9 envelopes in the free version 
and be aware you have to pay $5 a month for more."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me stay on top of my finances. Highly recommend for 
anyone who wants to take control of their money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Love being able to sync with my husband's phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What I was looking for. Works great. Not just for budgeting, tracks account 
balances too. Haven't seen anything I'd rather use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps keep tabs of spending. Very simple and was exactly what I was 
looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Exactly what I need to keep up with the family budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and a great tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app for Money management"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I WROTE THIS YEARS AGO AND IT IS STILL 100% TRUE: It took me a while to 
warm to this one but after trying several different budgeting apps, this 
one remains the simplest and the best. I could now not imagine life without 
it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple & customizeable. Been using this app for years!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that it carries over from month to month. Not all budget apps do that 
and it really sucks when you have to start fresh every month so, kudos on a 
job well done!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app. Beats using Excel 😂"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, helped me get real with where my money's going! I found it so 
useful I purchased a subscription. I like being able to keep track of all 
my different accounts and keep myself accountable with my spending, 
""Reports"" are brilliant to compare how it varies across time, etc. The app 
has lots of functionality, but it's not overcomplicated like some others I 
tried. One thing I'm missing from the mobile app is being able to set up an 
account transfer like in the web version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track and helps me save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use. Really helps us stay on track with our spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best for budgets"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use & update on the go"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the ease of entering and keeping track of our budget and expenses. 
Even though we don't do everything as prescribed, it still works really 
well with our system. Being able to sync with both our phones and the 
computer is key. I have tried other similar apps, and this one fits my 
brain the best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have years now using goodbudget and I can say this is my day to day app 
to control my personal finances. Is just a must have and the best"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, simple to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Still learning how to use but the idea is brilliant."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice app to manage your monthly budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It makes it so easy to keep track of my spending. Great app for someone 
trying to get a handle on their finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Two+ people track expenses Yay!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly app. Makes year end tax season much easier for me as I 
can export my info on spreadsheets. Year end is not the headache it used to 
be now that I use this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and awesome to use :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couldn't live without it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Seems to have problems. With the free version it won't sync back to the 
server. It just keeps saying it has problems and will try later, it's been 
9 days. Therefore I can't access any of my stuff online and can't change 
the settings for how the envelopes are filled. It's been kind of 
disappointing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't even use the full features in the app, but it absolutely beats 
carrying around a little envelope of cash everywhere. Any time we stop 
using the app, we'll overspend like crazy. It's good to see those numbers 
and the progress of where you should be throughout the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great help for a family on a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful and helpful. It gave me great insights when solving several 
financial problems."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app to create budgets and track daily spending. I have 
everything in different categories and I also have long-term savings goals. 
I do not use the paid version of this app because I don't need it to link 
to my bank account. It's super easy to use and you can set monthly updates 
in transfers and payments into it. I have everything in my bank setup for 
auto bill pay and it makes everything work really nicely. Also I have it 
set to automatically populate my categories whenever I get paid. I used a 
lot of different apps before sticking with this one I really love this for 
my budgeting purposes. I use one other app for a register for my checkbook 
balances. Otherwise this does all of my budgeting and financial needs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep my budget on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Solid and reliable. Been using it for years to help manage my budgets. Love 
it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to budget your expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for my budgeting needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has helped us in retirement stay on track financially. Easy to set up and 
easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a couple years now and it is great it has 
really helped me watch where my money is going and helping me set limits 
and stick to a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Basic and works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I needed a solution for my wife and I to have spending visibility and 
control. A long time ago we used envelope budgeting. It worked great, but 
we did not want to deal with cash. I was looking for a solution that 
allowed us to implement digital envelope budgeting. Goodbudget has allowed 
us to easily implement this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please add support for split screen usage"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app I've ever used."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Free version allows two mobile devices which allows my wife and 
I to stay synced on our budget. Easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for collaborating with my wife on our spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So great!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Now an essential appp for me. This year I plan on getting a Financial 
Advisor, but this app will always be my first FA. I improved my budget 
planning dramatically! Quick and easy to enter purchases and payments. 
Update: It's been 6 years now, 3 phones later, and I still love this app! 
(Samsung GS7 is my current phone)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app ever! Has helped me for the past 6 years now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped us stay on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GoodBudget is simple and straight-forward to use. I got the paid version to 
track my checking account and credit cards."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app/website for several years now. And I love it. It 
helps me stay accountable to my budget. I keep track of my cc debt (that 
I'm paying down)... The only thing I wish I could do is reconcile my 
accounts on the phone. Currently (as far as I can figure out) I can only do 
it online. Update: 11/30/2016 Still loving this app/program. Use it daily. 
Helps me see where my spending issues are. Update: 7/17/2018. Still loving 
it. Still using it every day!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant budgeting app. Requires a bit of day to day admin but I can 
easily see what I've been overspending on, and how I'm comparing against 
what I should be ideally spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. It helps me keep my budget as far ahead 
as I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Maybe improve data analysis"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use the free version of the app. This is good app for trying to follow 
the Dave Ramsey envelope method without actually having to use cash, which 
just isn't practical for me. I like that I have to manually move the 
monetary amounts rather than it happening automatically (although you can 
schedule transactions if you prefer). It helps me stay accountable and feel 
every purchase just like if I was using cash. The only problem I have had 
with the app is when I tried to use the option for getting paid every other 
week. It was budgeting more money for me to spend than I was actually 
making. To counter that, I now just list that paycheck as twice a month. If 
there happens to be a third pay period in a month I just add that one 
manually. It's worked like a charm ever since I figured out that one little 
issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome! It's just too useful..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it, I was using YNAB but then they changed to the subscription only 
model and I have been looking far and wide for something to replace it. 
Then I found GoodBudget, it's still a subscription but it allows monthly 
payments as well as great visuals of your money along with a number."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It works well for our needs and have been using it for 8 months now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for over a year now and I love it!! I've never had a 
problem and it works like a digital envelope system, which is what I wanted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love good budget, and the web app is snappy, easy to use, and easy to 
organize. The mobile app is nice and does the job for when I am on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the best budgeting apps out there"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app since December of 2011. The fact that I need no other 
after all this time should say everything you need to know. love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using Goodbudget for more than five years, and it's allowed me to 
get through some really tight periods, and turn our finances around. I even 
use it for my business budgeting as well. So simple and powerful all at 
once. I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Only just started using. Don't know all features but I LOVE IT. The money 
bag system works!!! Brilliant for keeping track of your money. I highly 
recommend it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple. Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couldn't stay on track without it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful for a household of two that want a shared app for budgetting. Works 
well as a free app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helpful a LOT!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome, has kept me from going negative in my bank account for 2 years!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a bit confusing at first to add money into accounts everytime your 
paycheck comes, but I think I've finally figured it out. The app is nice 
because it syncs with both my husband iPhone and my Samsung, plus we can 
use a computer as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. User friendly and simple to use. Synchronisation and use 
across multiple devices makes it ideal. Well done to the developers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"intuitive and effective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this program - a must for managing a budget.  It is quick and easy to use with a great interface.  Request: Would like when you do a search to have a total show, and when you look inside an envelope to see a total of spend and total of contributions (not just the balance)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After 25 years, finally using a budget for the past 2 months. Great results 
so far. Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant. My wife and I use this daily. Best budgeting app out 
there. Keep up the awesome work"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app. Just wish there was a way to set up bimonthly paychecks without 
having to set up 2 different transactions. It messes with the amount in 
unallocated which I can't reset to 0. Also, I wish there was a way to 
highlight or check mark when something has cleared. I like to match with my 
statements to make sure everything was entered, but can be a bit 
challenging when different cards are used. It would be easier to see right 
away what has cleared and what hasn't. Otherwise I really like it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it to track budgets that I have already preestablished. This is so 
simple and perfect. The interface is brilliant to visually track your 
spending. The best app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super tool to manage a personal budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget helps my husband and I stay on the same page when it comes to 
our budget. And it's helped us make the transition from no kids to two 
kids, and from two incomes to part time income. I don't know where we'd be 
without it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for a month now. I was using mint, but switched to this. 
Putting in my expenses makes me think more about my purchases. Also, 
goodbuget is still really easy to use! The free version has everything I 
need so far, and is available on my tablet and laptop. UPDATE: been using 
this for six months now and it has been great! Highly recommend this app! 
UPDATE: been using for years now, doing the paid version. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lets me use my envelope system without having masses of actual cash & coins 
cluttering up my house."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helpful when managing joint accounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting tool for couples."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Simple to use. Does the job well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app. Nice to keep track of everything you spend and earn."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was confusing at the start but now that I've got the hang of it I'm 
managing my money so much better! It really helps you budget out your cash 
and the envelope's faces are so cute which is a bonus :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Effective multi family member budgeted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you're looking for a simple app to track spending habits manually and 
have buckets that you can edit yourself this is your app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to follow and uses the Dave Ramsey system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Muito bom, o sistema de envelopes é um ótimo indicador visual para a 
montagem do planejamento. Recomendo!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It says you can link a bank account. You can't. You can manually put in 
dollar amounts for ""accounts"". It says 2 free accounts, when trying to add 
a second it says ""you've reached your limit"" . Absolute garbage app. Can't 
use it at all how it's advertised."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Love it! It's keeping me on point for my budget. Revised Please fix! Too 
many glitches."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Micromanaged envelope budgeting system done right."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's based on the envelope budget system and gives me the tools I need 
manage our finances without getting too complex. Have had the paid version 
for several years now, and the best way to define its success is that my 
wife will actually use it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exacty what is promised"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app! My hubby and I love how it keeps us on budget and makes sure 
we are being diligent with our spending. It outdoes all the other apps we 
tried before this one. Definitely worth it. You won't be disappointed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use this app and service to great effect to teach our 14 & 10 year old 
sons to budget. It's not quite powerful enough for our particular household 
where we employ YNAB but for starting out with zero based budgeting, it's 
great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's good enough to do what I need right now, but it feels a little clunky. 
However, I am a big fan of the envelope system and this is one of the few 
apps that uses it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps in budgeting and tracking finances. Very easy to 
use. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Good for personal budgeting. The envelop system is brilliant! I wonder why 
other similar apps lack this feature?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use. I set everyone who will let me up with this app. Life 
saver!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"excelent for my butgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the service, but older phones beware! If you have an older phone and 
noticed the app stopped syncing recently DO NOT LOG OUT, CLEAR DATA OR 
UNINSTALL. They've stopped supporting Android versions prior to 5.0 and you 
will never be able to access the app again if you do. Web version still 
works fine, but not nearly as convenient. Really annoyed they didn't make 
this clear when the change happened."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped my husband and I take control of our finances. 
We no longer have arguments about money because we can see how much we have 
left in our budget and where all our money went with a touch of a few 
buttons. The app itself works great, never crashes and is intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just great. Easy, effective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is THE BEST budgeting tool I have ever found! It is so easy and 
intuitive to use, and it gives me total visibility and control of my money. 
The cute envelope mascot is a fun touch and a good motivator."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Smart app. Can improve significantly in look and feel."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Worry about money decreased 80% fighting about spending decreased 95%."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use. Helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app since 1 or 2 years ago. Overall the functions it 
good - separating wallet and goal, money distribution, customized report. 
Few thing should take into account is that some of the function is not 
inside the app and only available on website version, such as manage wallet 
refill, fund transfer from wallet to wallet (you can only select credit or 
expense but not transfer). And the quick transaction on widget doesn't 
work. I selected the ""Add to quick transaction widget"" and yet it doesn't 
shown on widget or the manage quick transaction edit setting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that the 2 of us can use this app to track our spending. It allows 
us to use our credit cards, while still using the envelope system to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I'm not able to sync the latest transaction in the app. It's been 4 days 
since the issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best envelope system budget available. Simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Been a paying customer for a long time. I like this app but pretty 
disappointed that there is no true progress. I posted the things many ppl 
would like to see added but no response. These were 1) the need of 3 
decimal marks. And 2) multiple currency. Since many of us have more than 
one currency that we deal with. You guyz dont have to add all the 
currencies. Let us choose our own abbreviations. We can literally type 
""usd"" and ""eur"" etc. On our own. This way the app at least wont treat all 
the accounts the same way and give you unrealistic total amounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a great app if you're trying to save for a house and figure out we all 
your money is going. Will take some time to set up so be patient"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Very good app but stopped working on Android 4.4.2 KitKat. I am unable to 
log in due to a connection error. I tried this both on 4G and a stable 
Wi-Fi."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect digital replacement for our cash envelope system. Now my husband 
and I can stay in sync. The only thing that would make it better would be 
the ability to auto update or at least import transactions from our bank 
account. Great job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a few years. Simple and well done. Syncs with my 
husband's phone so we can track our collective spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If this app could improve a few minor things with the budgeting part and 
adding the ability to take pictures of receipts for transactions then it 
would be absolutely prefect! I loved this app from the moment I first 
opened it. Thanks for helping to make my life easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what we wanted it to do. Takes a bit to get used to, but 
very effective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good financial app to track your income and expenses. I already try 
some other app, and so far this is the best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent, easy to use, superb tech support. Really love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best user experience budgeting app! Clear, easy interface. Makes budgeting 
work 👍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app ever, been using it for close to a year"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps us not just track or expenses but also proactively stay in 
budget on each budget line. It brings peace of mind to our financial lives 
and allows us to effortlessly save."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this budgeting app! It's everything I want, and simple to use! Lots of 
features for those who want to budget a bit more heavily, but the features 
that I don't use don't get in my way in the slightest. Next to email and 
internet, this is my favorite and most used app on my phone for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely everything I'm looking for in a budgeting app. I spent hours 
combing through similar apps but they all charged exorbitant monthly 
subscription fees just to access more than 3 envelopes. At first I didn't 
like that I couldn't add an additional account for free, but now I love it 
because having to log into my bank account to see how much is in my savings 
makes it feel like it's growing faster! Plus I'm less tempted to withdraw 
from my savings if I can't see the number without logging into my bank. 
Also love that this is attached to an account (rather than just the app) so 
you can see all of your information and graphics online. Love love love."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Way to hard to set up, the interface is confusing. Too much work to get it 
to do what I want, uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its very handy to track your spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's a lovely, helpful app, but whenever I add to any of My goal envelopes 
it doesn't come off the amount remaining - it shows I've allocated it to 
the goal envelope but the remaining amount isn't diminishing at all so it's 
quite frustrating in that respect. Otherwise I good app and well worth 
downloading!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For free this is great. Basic app to manage my money and helps me stick to 
my budget and see where my money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect simplicity"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Can be easy to use. Be sure to do the quick YouTube Tutorials 
before doing too much. They make it even easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great basic budget strategy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what is says have to buy extra envelopes but the free ones are 
plenty"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The envelope system is what we needed to manage our money. Really 
simplifies budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has finally made it possible for my wife and I to follow the 
envelope system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Edit: the reply from the devs explained how to do weekly budgeting. 
Awesome! 5 stars from me. Previous review: Please add an option to do 
weekly and bi-weekly envelopes. I get paid every week, and that's the 
easiest way to budget for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is just what I needed to start a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way for me and my wife to keep track of our personal finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Must have!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! A bit of a learning curve at first. I like that I can see 
my budget at a glance. So much simpler and more practical than my Mint app. 
Cute interface too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Needs a modernized look and feel. The icon is cheesy and the built-in 
keyboard is small and even unnecessary, just open the native OS keyboard 
instead."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Exploring how to resolve some reconciliation postponed problems."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Light and super quick app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's the most functional free envelope style budgeting app I've seen. I 
liked Mint but the envelope feature doesn't exist and you can't manually 
adjust spending goals. Everything is set by month, but because of our pay 
periods my budget month runs the 15th to the 15th. With this app you can 
easily add charges and categorize them, you can even split transactions 
which is great. I love that is syncs so other users can be responsible to 
add their own charges. I wish it would sync with my bank so I didn't have 
to manually enter every single charge. You only get 10 free envelopes so a 
more simplified budget is best. It has worked wonders to control our 
spending so that we can do things and not feel guilty for spending money 
and we can keep ourselves from going in the hole. It's definitely something 
I recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps to keep your spending on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Need a bug fix for the Quick Transactions widget on the Samsung Galaxy S6: 
The widget scrolls through entries fine, but when I try to edit or even 
just save the entry, it closes without any update to the app. Otherwise, as 
always, love the company, mission, and product as always! Although I have a 
paid subscription, it is a fantastic, easy to use budgeting tool in either 
paid or free form."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We tried a few other budgeting apps, but this one has been the best. The 
ability for my husband and me to stay up to date on our budget has made our 
financial life so much easier"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the flexibility of this app, have used or for years. Also appreciate 
the interaction with the development team on the forum, really feels like 
they're listening to those of us using it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"App is simple but well thought out and capable. Has helped us control our 
spending and better understand our trends."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app to help you keep track of your expenses and income. A bit 
complicated to set up at first but overall helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tremendously beneficial app. Very straight forward and easy to use. We've 
used the app for many years. We didn't want to use other apps and link our 
actual accounts. This works quite well as an envelope system. My wife is a 
saver, but this app keeps me in check. It's amazing what that bar in the 
red can do!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and across all devicds. Best budgeting app I've seen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good for budget keeping especially for multiple people."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome replacement for my envelope budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use envelope system"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice app to help you save cash and track your expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Try this app for 3 months. The Biggest issue is that it does not sync 
properly causes your envelopes to have the wrong amount."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope budget system works great for controlling spending. App 
implemented it nicely. However I use it in combination with website. App is 
mostly used to keep track and add transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ideal for privacy and security. I can manage my household budget with my wife without having to give a third party my credentials to my bank accounts. I do not have to give any PII either to manage my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeping track of the spending of the whole house is eye opening and tough to stay on budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I lile how visual the design is. It makes it very simple to see where your spending is at compared to your budget. The sync with spouse/significant other works well. The option to have reoccurring expenses is helpful. I do get frustrated that some aspects of the app are not as intuitive (i.e. changing a reoccurring envelope fill)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant budgeting tool. No more spresdsheets. Great tutorials and help."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it to keep on budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Flexible interface and simple layout. I love the behind/ahead of spending feature. This has really given me insight into my spending. Great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for tracking my grocery budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It Simple and helping you to keep your money under control"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works completely fine. Simple UI. Very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app... Free version allows for a single account and two mobile devices... Excellent way to keep track of a shared account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budget tool and app. We've been on the paid version a few years after a year in the free version. All bills auto post. Super easy to use on the go to keep track of other transactions since it remembers how you last posted a similar transaction. Only suggestion would to be to upload a picture of the receipt to the transaction. I use android and hub uses iPhone: syncs instantly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is very simple but very effective in keeping track of where your money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very new to the app and at first glance this app is great and overall what I was looking for in  a budget app. The only addition I would love to see is the ability to add notes to your goal budgets. IE. If I am going on a trip where I need to purchase items before the trip it would be nice to add notes to the budget envelope for that specific expense. Minor detail, more of a wish list item 😊"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Pretty good and easy to use. Love that there are no ads. I wish the yearly subscription had more features for less money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't speak for everybody but it was perfect for what I needed it to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Would be wonderful if the envelope fill was not so confusing. Been using the app for over two months and can't get the fill envelopes feature to work properly. Will have to delete and find something a little less confusing to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using only for a short while, however goodbudget is helping keep on top of where my money is going"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too cimplicated interface"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"THANK YOU GOODBUDGET!!! No more spreadsheets and notes at work, home, and in the car.  Wonderful little app to keep me on track and have what I can spend always at hand. They are constantly updating and working to improve the app and if you do have problems customer service is great. Always friendly, helpful, and will give you advise on the best way to setup whatever you're trying to track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super! Flexible and streamlined, so easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Still love it, now using for 2.5 years. The ONLY thing I wish it would do would be to do the Quick Fill in the app. I use the app for every single transaction, transfers, etc. And can easily use it to fill envelopes when I get a random bit of money. But our regular paycheques that are strictly budgeted - I have to go to browser to use the quick-fill. I know this is a beyooonnnddd first-world problem, but if I saw it in an update, I would give the app 6 stars out of 5 :)  I'm still so happy we pay for the full account - in our first 8 months of using we went from out net worth being -$500 to +$9000. Without feeling like we were sacrificing much. Thanks for bringing the proven ""cash budget"" system into the new millenium!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried many others but this ones the best for sure"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"While it took me a while to figure out how to make this app work for us, I think it will be just what we needed. I like that I don't have to sync my banking/credit info. I wish it had a more robust widget though. The current one seems buggy and I haven't been able to use it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great financial app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfectly simple, excellent budget app. I've kept a budget over a year with it and have no issues. And the free version gives you plenty of envelopes. Awesome overall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"In envelopes screen ie main screen the envelope doesn't show the remaining balance in it. Can u guide me for that"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I just upgraded to pro and it is amazing. Reconciling my accounts and managing all my envelopes (I used to call them buckets) is so much easier than the spreadsheet I'd been using, with all the same functionality covered plus more. And it syncs across all my devices and browser!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you have set this up how you like its a breeze to use. It has helped me save for my wedding while still managing to pay bills and credit card debt!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use once you understand it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best envelope-style budgeting app I have found so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, informative results, supplemented with valuable insights on various budgeting practice via its' newsletter"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice budgeting app.. Makes everything easier to budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would like to see some kind of obvious marking on transactions that have been split across multiple  envelopes (colour, bold, etc) Great app for budgeting and tracking spending! Use it every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app, very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy and organized! Can't spend without it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's simple to set up and super easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Only had it a short time, but so far so good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best app, just the best. Believe me, I'd know, I know apps. I've had all the best apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really love this app, just what I was looking for... perfect for my zero budget plan. Larry Burkett style."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Requires payee to be filled out when entering transactions. I just want to track how much I have left in my budget for eating out. All I should have to do is select the envelope and enter an amount with the date prefilled.  Good budget requires too much data entry."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using this app for over five years, and we absolutely love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Saves a ton of drama. At home"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for a year and find it VERY helpful.  I like that I can upload transactions from my bank or manually input them, that it is envelope based, can be viewed by my husband and I on our phones & home desktop, and that it is not directly linked to our bank account (which allows for a measure of security).  I lump all our bills into one envelope  ensuring that I can track flexible spending thereby making  it easy to balance my budget  ;-) ALL FOR FREE!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app it's just what I need. Only put 4 instead of 5 stars because of 2 missing features I would love to have. 1) Google assistant support 2) I commonly split purchases between the same 2 accounts 50/50 being able to split is awesome but being able to save a split preset of certain envelopes would save me a ton of clicks for every entry.  Thanks for the great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After trying several budgeting apps, I am so grateful to have found this one! The envelope system is so useful, and the app is ridiculously flexible, and easy to use.  You can set up budgets with different time frames, and fill them up at automated times (weekly, fortnightly, monthly, etc).  And the budgets can be overdrawn, rolled-over, and you can transfer from one category to another. What more could you ask for from a budgeting app?  Last but not least, my favourite part is the friendly messages that pop up when you add a transaction, to encourage you to keep budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is awsome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's like using the envelope system to budget, but had the convenience of syncing between my husband's phone and mine.  Plus you never need to run home for a  envelope of cash."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for many years, envelope system helps me keep track of 'spendable' money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect to separate my husbands and my spending money, savings, and bill money while keeping it all in one account. Updates in real time on both of our devices. Super simple to split bills, etc. Absolutely love this app. Oh! And we've only used the free version😀"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget really helps me track where my money is going. It requires discipline to log every purchase but it's definitely worth the hassle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Been using it for years to keep me on track with my bills."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"please add option to edit both date and time of transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good for shared $ tracking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best envelope budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried every (and I really mean every) budgeting app out there and this is the one that works for me. Does exactly what I want, stays out of my way, is more flexible than YNAB, and cheaper too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Exactly what I wished for tracking my budget. A bit confusing at first, but caught up with it after using it a few times! Excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A good real time budget app. You must put in all purchases instead of having NFC feature that will automatically put purchases into categories but it does save locations where purchases are made making it easy for future expenses. Quick easy pie charts show where your money is going at any time you want. Big plus is that one account will sync across andriod and iOS."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The envelope system is confusing to use, and to zero out at the end of the month. I had to manually clean out a reset each category at the end of every month and sometimes it still didnt get it right. Transactions are easy to post though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes it very easy to save and budget by setting up envelopes to split your money into saving and spending groups. When you spend money, you pick from which envelope it's spent. Wildly easy to be in control of your money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Optimistic and practical approach. Podcasts are well produced and relevant."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, enough features and reports to be useful but not so many too make it overwhelming. Can sync with family members. Guidance as to where spending should be during the budgeting period. Free version has enough features to be very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Idk much about much but ik that this app has helped me save money and also saved alot of fussing i used to do because i never knew where my hubbys money was going and now i do he also likes it too.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried Every dollar, but it budgeted money I hadn't earned yet. This app allows me to set it up to fill envelopes after I have money, so I can keep better track of what I actually have to spend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I wrote a glowing review of this app a while ago. I'm changing the rating from 5 stars to 1 because I just discovered a fatal flaw with the program: Sometimes it will not save transaction information after you click the Save button. I have tested this multiple times on several devices and browsers, and the error repeats itself across them all. At the very least, this means you have to double-check every single transaction you add, since the error seems to be random. Unfortunately I discovered this error way too late to reconstruct the history of my accounts, which is a devastating loss of information. Obviously I strongly advise anyone against using this app. You can't trust it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app. A bit expensive the full version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love that I can see where I am in my budget every day! Much more helpful than only inputting my expenses once a week on my spreadsheet at home. This helps me make smart decisions on the go and has good visuals showing you if you're behind or ahead for the month. Just started exploring the web version and looks like it makes it even more versatile by importing transactions you've missed and scheduling envelope refills. You need to schedule your refills on the web for it to do it right on your phone. Love it so far!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, makes budgeting a snap."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No need to link my real life saving account to a website. Easy to use with widget function. Highly recommend it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helps me keep track of my spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for over 5 years. Switched to the paid version after a year. It is so easy to work with"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Live it and is simple and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Only been using it for a month but pretty happy with it so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and wonderful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"simple and practical to use.no fuss app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I recommend this app to everybody wanting to get better control of their spending. It can be configured to meet a variety of budgeting needs and is super user-friendly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a good and simple to use app. All expenses can be tracked against a set budget. This is the best part of this app. It takes some time to understand the way to use though. Might deter some first time users."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A simple way to create and track your budget. Have been using it for several years and have come to depend on it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"easy to use after playing around for awhile. considering it's free I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A very easy way to keep track of my budget. I've been using it for years and it works very well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for years to stay on top of my budget and avoid overspending. Great for saving for multiple items. Definitely recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great for keeping my budget on track. I have used it for years, and I highly recommend it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not very user-friendly. Unable to have envelopes for monthly and twice a month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for about 2.5 rears, and upgraded to subscription right away. Great features and simple to use. A+++"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I actually really like the app but it lacks in a bank sync feature which is very important to others. I am. Likely going to switch and they will list my business because they are unwilling to add this feature. Many others have asked for this and they say its actually a feature that they don't sync, but you have to upload your bank transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"10 free envelopes only. The subscription to this app eats up your money too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love using Good budget to help keep me on track! It's easy to use and I like having various ways to input expenses and view my spending reports."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a lifesaver for watching your expenses! Very easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app but I had to stop using it because it only accepts one kind of expense for everything. My husband and I get paid every 2 weeks but we have bills that are monthly and the way the app works is if we put income every 2 weeks than all the expenses will be calculated as how much money you need to spend every 2 weeks. Even though some don't work like utilities mortgage/rent. It always got me confused after trying again an again 3 different times"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Changed my life for the better"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great simple budget app that's easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My household wanted something to track our spending that didn't require a lot of setup or the need to connect to any Banks or cards, and that's exactly what this is. Easy to use, multi-user friendly, funny icons. It's easy and works exactly how I'd expect it to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"good support"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a little confusing to set up at first, as the concepts of creating and filling up envelopes isn't explained that well. Once you've figured it out it's a great app though; in my opinion the perfect balance between features / functionality and complexity."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app can't reach it's fully use unless you pay, can't do if you are free user"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Won't stay open long enough to do much. Every time I try to do anything, it crashes. I've sent a ton of bug reports. Won't sync so I can't even do it online. SUPER frustrating!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"plz day and week view/ i hope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really love this app! It is so simple and easy to use. I used to get overwhelmed by all the different features on other budgeting apps. I am really too lazy to worry about all of that. I have simplified my budget categories and GoodBudget has been great. Highly recommend for people who just want a low stress user friendly budget app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the ap although it is a bit tricky to set up the envelopes. But am very disappointed as i have never been able to sync with it, has always said 'unable to cync at this time please try again later'. Now i have a new phone and even though i have been registered with goodbudged for a couple of years i still cant cync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app since 2013 and I love it! I miss the old look of the envelopes when it was EEBA, but other than that, I really have no complaints,  and that's not even a complaint lol. I am on this app everyday,  and I think it's Fantastic and recommend it to everyone.  :-D it is not a banking integrated app, it it's an envelope app, and for that use it is perfect!  I do use the paid version, but I used the free version for 3yrs and it was great, I just needed more envelopes.  God Bless ~Amy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Pretty much perfect app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I paid for extra envelopes but it made a huge mess of my money and envelopes.. Now paid 5 99 for something I can't use. I just got the sub not 10 min ago too . Not happy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to keep track of cash based expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that you dont have to put in actual bank account and can use offline and sync later"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No matter what I tried it kept telling me I had negative balances when I had spent LESS than my budget. How is that possible? Would never recommend! Do not use this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use,  I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app.  It makes using an ""envelope"" system possible for my family.   There are some, though, and different functionality between the web version and the phone version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crashing on my galaxy s7 edge"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and navigate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great, useful app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I seriously love using this app! It helps me budget where I need to be and reminds me when I'm in the bad zone.  It only gives you 10 free envelopes,  so we combine a lot into different sections. I do wish we could have more envelopes without paying,  but I do see the point in paying for more.  For everything I get out of this app, it is worth downloading! Would recommend to everyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"helpful and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A little tricky to understand and implement at first, but once I understood the setup it was very easy to properly budget and gague expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I cannot get it to sync.  What I set up in the app is not showing up in web version.  Every time I try to sync I get error, ""hmm, problems syncing back to server.  No problem.  I'll try again later."""
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for a year now and i got all the features that i need in the free version even with limited number of envelopes. Very simple and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using Goodbudget for over a year now. When I had to get a new phone, this was one of the important apps I transferred over. I don't have it hooked up to a bank account, but it's great for keeping track of my cash purchases and seeing how I'm doing for the month. I keep my credit card and bills on a spreadsheet instead. I would highly recommend it for anyone starting out learning to budget, or someone like me, who needs to keep up with where their cash is going easily and quickly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using this app for years to manage our budget and it's amazing. It keeps us on track and very easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Uso há mais de dois anos e continuo amando."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app It has help get my finances in order, no more excuses. I now tell my money where to go, not guess where it went.oh so true"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Gives 10 free envelopes but gave me a hard type with syncing data as well as with refilling envelopes with income. Not intuitive!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Our family use this for budgeting and it works great. Helped us go from living paycheck to paycheck to being financially stable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's a good app to keep track of monthly overheads for different envelopes but free version should have few more envelopes and sub categories should also be there for better tracking of expenditure"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for years. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app for family budgeting. Only problem is: GOAL envelopes have to be filled from income not transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of holiday spends, definitely be using this back home"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I didn't get idea of multiple envelops. App has poor customization and only a few reports"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used GoodBudget for two years now. It's never failed me. I wouldn't use anything else."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Basic easy and intuitive.  Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it, it easy to use and it works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app nice features"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I've used so far. It's an everyday tool for my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It works well to share between me and my husband. I have been using it for about 2 years. Overall, very satisfied and helps us keep a written budget. It takes a little getting used to when you have to adjust envelopes or if you forget to clear your envelopes at the end of a month. For a free app we are very satisfied!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for several years. I wanted one that didn't tie into my bank account like the majority of these apps wanted. This app is very helpful. Keeps me on track with my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A good budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great help in sticking to a budget and keeping finances/spending on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what we wanted! Doesn't want access to all your accounts, just lets you setup budgets for multiple envelopes. My wife has an iPhone and it syncs seamlessly between our phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, it helps me be more organized with my money... Absolutely love it!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Revolutionized how I do my money.  Its such a relief knowing if I just follow my budgets I will not only stay out of debt but pay PFF debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Love the concept of this app. But it won't sync online and now it's saying the feature of activating the pending monthly envelope fill can only be done on the website. So after of month I'm virtually frozen on what to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good and Simple App to keep track of your expenses and to plan your funds"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome and pretty easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Really helped us budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like an electronic checkbook ledger that syncs to other devices. Awesome for keeping track of spending for more than one user per account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm into the envelope budgeting method and found this app to be a  great implementation of  it.  UI is very intuitive, unlike some of the competitors.  You barely get any  accts and envelopes w/o a premium subscription -- but if you pay annually, it's a better deal than many of the popular competitors.  I manually input transactions so can't comment on syncing w/ banks.  But the ease of use and good choice of reports has me sold.  Best in class!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helped us keep an eye on our spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app for budget. Tried many apps but this is by far the best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, but bit complicated at first glimpse."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and it's helped me save a lot of money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant. Envelope system works absolutely fine, tracking is easy. 10/10 has helped me save"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and really helps u stay on budget. After each purchase u can  easily enter a transaction."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I'm giving this app five stars! It's absolutely amazing. There is a bit of a learning curve, but their website has videos and articles to help guide new users through the process. I've been using the free version of this app for five years and it has helped me budget and save my money!Today I upgraded to have unlimited envelopes and am very happy and excited to continue reaching my financial goals.   Thank you Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I believe in privacy! And every app is about knowing you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps us on track. Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Months later, still find this a fantastic tool to manage my money and spending habits! Took a little while to figure it out and get into the habit of tracking expenses but once u get started it's all cool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. The only thing that confuses me slightly is adding to budget amount and setting to budget amount - this doesn't work as I'd expect. Apart from this it really is a brilliant app. We have used it for over a year now to manage our budgets. We're now doing a big house renovation and we've been able to manage all those expenses in the app as well as all the normal monthly outgoings."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years as a way to manage my money. Used it to budget and track all of my spending until I got out of debt. Since then I've just been using it as a checkbook register that both my husband and I update in real time so that we don't have to worry about keeping receipts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app.I able to track my budget very clearly..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A simple budgeting app that's easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Miscategorized virtually every transaction. It took hours every week to correct them. On top of that, I paid for the privilege."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is so easy to use. Keeps me on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of spending, with an easy ui"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, very user friendly widget and very quick splitting a transaction into multiple envelopes. Couldn't ask for more from an envelope budgeting app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budgeting and tracking monthly expenses has never been easier. Lots of useful reports too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Quite handy app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and a good system if you know how to organize you envelopes. Has some good tutorials. Paid subscription gives you more to work with, but I just use the free version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app really helping"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful and extremely accurate"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app. Super easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Gives me exactly what I need and nothing more. 2 devices, 20 envelopes, no adds, a useful widget, and that is just the free version.   This app allows you to build a biweekly budget which is something most of the big name apps did not do well. You can upload your bank/credit card statements and categorize everything all at once or log transactions as you make them.  I tried using the big name apps that monitor your accounts and try to categorize transactions for you, but those always made mistakes, and the delay between when I played for something and when it showed up on the app made it seem like the numbers never truly represented how much I had left. Not to mention the security risk of giving them my bank log-in info.  This app may require a small amount of effort in that you have to log transactions yourself, but once you set up the envelopes correctly this becomes effortless. Anytime you reach for your wallet you log it on your phone. This small amount of effort gives you a perfect picture of your financial situation.  We use this app to keep track of our long term savings like Christmas and annual fees, but we also use it for our 2 week budget because we get paid every 2 weeks. Some envelopes get filled to the top and others get a set amount each payday.   Do yourself a favor and get this app. Me and my wife have never been more in synch when it comes to our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall I love the app, it helps me keep on track. I use the free version and only after 2 years and now needing a bit more complicated budget has the free envelopes started to feel a bit restricted. I have 2 reasons for not giving it a 5 star rating - I used to be able to set the $ amount when filling envelopes from unallocated, I can't do that anymore and I wish the Android and iOS apps were more similar."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's ok."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Wonderful app, great features - expense tracking, budgeting, reporting, billing reminders, sophisticated and simple UI et all. I'm afraid it still just doesn't justify a recurring subscription amount of 6 USD/month or 50 USD annual. What a shame."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I look forward to more website only options being implemented on the app. More reports, balancing transactions, and most importantly an easy ability to mark transactions as cleared. Can you implement a long press or gesture to make this happen?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for in a buget app. No linking to my personal accounts.  Completely customizable categories. Also no burden of trying to remember where all of my money is going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for family budget. Shared account with husband so we both can add and track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and well-designed. I recommend this app to everyone I know who wants to get a handle on their spending and budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, perfect for monitoring personal and household budgets. It makes the sometimes difficult discussion about money very easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the greatest home budget software!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what we wanted. Allows us to use the ""envelope"" system with just an app on our phones. It's easy to update and doesn't track all your personal information or assault you with ads."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app does not have the option for bi-monthly accounting filling (15th and 30th), and it is extremely annoying.  Also, the fact that you can't have the same frequency for budget envelopes as with expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please make it work with android split screen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use. Very visual. This works even though I'm normally lazy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Efficient someone way to budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great to have! I appreciate the ability this app gives me to stay in a healthy financial state."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use the free version and I really love it.  The best part for me is the ability to put notes on all my entries which really helps with remembering what we bought.  I would give it 5 stars but honestly, it was a bit confusing to set up.  Totally worth the time it took to figure it out though.  Last month was the first time I've ever stayed in budget and it was in large part due to this app.  If the paid version was not so expensive, I would but it (even though I don't need it) just to support their efforts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of your finances, save money, and pay off debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good way to budget, is how I reviewed it a year ago, but I'm changing this to ""a GREAT way to budget""!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"All i need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple and useful application for me who don't have a lot of time to input me expense. It would be better if it suggest how many should I spend in one day to fit the budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great tool to manage money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"All you need to keep a record of your budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great apps but locks me out periodically as I have ""too many users"" literally one person only.  I have to log on to website and revoke myself from the login then add again.  This is irritating. The rest is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the envelope budgeting system. And Goodbudget works great. Only problem im having is working with the mobile site, trying to get the boxes checked for reconciling is a pain. Its sporadic at best. Please fix. It works well on a regular computer, but the whole reason I have the app is for my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love love love"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Helps us keep track of cash."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for sticking to budget. Paid version makes tracking actual cash easy through use of multiple accounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good enough. Simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very close to what I was looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for our family budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up and keep track of household budget. From weekly spending to annual savings goals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it to do. Nice and simple, love it. I really like the Goal feature if you're saving up money. This app will keep you on track if you stick to your budget..although sometimes i stray away lol"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this for basic budgeting. Nothing fancy, no linking accounts. A simple money in compared to money out. It's like an old fashioned kids' money box. You put monthly or weekly funds in each envelope and monitor expenses. When it's gone it's gone.  Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried many finance apps and this is by far the best. Really easy to use and a great way to track and manage your spending. Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Finally can use my envelopes cash budgeting technique with my card and not have to do the math myself when I 'balance my checkbook'. Love this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Been using it for more than 3 years. Really helpful to manage our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to manage our budget. My wife and I are able to log purchases daily. Helps us not go over spending budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"helps me stay on track. fairly easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I use Quicken and have many accounts as well as many different types of accounts. Getting this setup wasn't easy; however, the developers respond quickly in the forums and once it is setup it is fairly easy. Wish list: auto sync with my bank a la Quicken, 401k & investment tracking, export to Quicken natively."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Multiplatform (web/Android/iOS), clean design, rich in features, in active development. Perfect for me :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what we need it to, which is basically just tracking expenses. And that's great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Using it for a couple of months now... Really useful..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have tried so many other budget apps and spreadsheets, and this is hands down my favorite by FAR! I am a very detailed oriented person, and I budget down to the penny. This budget allows me to see all of my decisions and how they impact the rest of my budget. I used the free version for 7 years or so. But, I finally made the leap to the paid subscription, and I don't think I'll ever look back. It has been worth the money to me. The free version only gave me so many envelopes before I had to buy a subscription (which is honestly very generous of them and I'm so thankful for their free app while in college and starting out in life). But, I still had to use an excel spreadsheet to keep track of things since I had to combine budgets together in one envelope. Now in the paid version I can have as many envelopes as my heart desires. I can have ""goals"" that I work up to and not just a monthly bill I budget for. Do I need a new dishwasher, I'll create an envelope for it as a goal and when I have the money in there, I know I can afford it guilt free. I cannot recommend this app enough. I love that my husband and I can both have the app on our phone to keep track of everything together."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice way to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Good customer service, bad programing. I guess it's really made for the web app. I started with the phone app, and tried to schedule an envelope fill. Well, it has to sync to do that, which mine will not do. I registered my household and everything. Troubleshooting the problem did not work, and so support told me I would have to manually transfer my data to the web app. I'm 3 months in, no way am I doing that. I'd sooner transfer the info to another app, or maybe just go back to pen and paper. On this app, using my phone, there's no way to schedule an envelope fill, but much worse than that I can't delete a scheduled envelope fill either. It's just always going to be there with an error message."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly and can use across multiple devices so you can make it work for a family budget. Just like cash budgeting in jars or envelopes. So far the free version has been great, but a few more envelopes would be nice, instead of just 10. Not ready to pay for the full version at this point."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"been using it for 2 years, its not the best app, but the best that is available, not sure if there is any other app that can offer the same, however you need to pay 45 $ per year."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So much nicer then carrying my check book around"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well and syncs easily with my wife's phone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Much better apps out there which are cheaper."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I am not able to sync my account for last 10 days. Not able to add money in the envelope. Developers team please help me in this regard."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting and for tracking your expenses"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeping true to your budget is a choice and a habit. Good budget helps me do that. I whip it out whenever I make a purchase and categorize it so I have instant accountability."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only allows you to have 10 envelopes. Any more and it'll cost you 50 bucks a year! What a rip off"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Handy app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I downloaded the app, however I need something that would let me input for the 1st and the 15th of the month, not monthly or bi-monthly. I will have to keep looking. 😐"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps keep the family on budget! Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and brilliant"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that my husband and I can both use the app and that it's so easy. Lost receipts and other surprises to our monthly budget don't happen when we used this app faithfully."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple, efficient!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great simple app for helping stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Everything great except the widget broken."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly envelope style budget app.  Does everything it says it can."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app... really helps you keep track of spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little confusing at first. Seems like you have to use the desktop version for certain things which is annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has found the perfect balance between simplicity and feature availability. Other apps had too many features, making it hard to use and understand. GoodBudget has the best user interface I've seen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Would not allow me to get more envelopes for other bills and every time I set budget for groceries and gas it would change back to original plan. Not happy with it at all!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Solid approach, need to be able to edit from mobile platform. Can only do some functions from computer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love how my wife and I can both budget on the same account from different phones in real time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's great - does the things you need it to without unnecessary faff. You need to keep it up to date, but that's more a thing about budgeting than about the app. I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"works great, simple to use and syncs with my wife's phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this simplistic yet robust app.  You can drill down and be a power budgeter or you can you take a lighter approach but still say on top of your money.  Highly recommend Goodbudget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best envelope system. Can keep the $ in the bank instead of in envelopes at home 👍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for a number of years and love it. Very easy when oyt and about to see what is left on each envelope. The only bad bit is if you enter a receipt for the previous month it still deducts it from the current month's amount. Only a small issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's allowed me to keep an eye on my expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic and keeps things simple. It gave me a fresh start after I paid off my credit card debt and has prevented me from overspending ever since. I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this simple app. Easy to figure out, super easy to use and instantly add transactions. Love the auto-sync, my husband and I know exactly and immediately how much money we have each month for our many different categories of spending. All types of reports to analyze and compare spending habits. We love having both envelope options - monthly and annual (save up/rollover over time). I recommend this app to anyone looking to track their spending habits and keep a closer eye on their money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this for years and it keeps me on track during the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"First off, let me say it's a good app for the most part. However, the envelope system is really clunky trying to get it set up. You cannot easily change the envelope size, and the fill envelopes feature is not really easy to use when it comes to adding or changing amounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelope metaphor; inputting of spending is fast and simple; filling envelopes monthly is easy once you've defined your budget; website also available in a pinch.  Thx!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Well, my wife doesn't like it because she now has to see the impact of her spending pattern. But hell I'm loving it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes a little bit of learning, but so worth it. Very stable, practical app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hruuuza"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lovely little app to help track expenses and budget overruns!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for staying out of debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too hard to break things up the way i want"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very handy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a simple app that works and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps you organize your life and reduce stress. It's a no brainer"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The interface is a little difficult. Overall good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best alternative to the Every Dollar budget that I have seen so far. Simple to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is just the system of envelopes plus bank reconciliations I've been looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Horrible. It rolls over any leftover money you have into the next month and there is NO WAY to undo this setting. It encourages you to empty every envelop rather than save your money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that it does just what I need it to do: act as an envelope system that isn't over complicated and syncs with my husband. We don't overspend and we know where our money goes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app which fully supports the 'envelope' system. I love being able to track transactions, log expenses on the go via the widget and view reports via envelope / payee. The web application is also very user friendly and there is so much functionality which I haven't yet tapped into. I totally recommend this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app it really helps me keep an eye on my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Only downloaded it today but find the infographics​ and idea of envelopes really helpful. Also, they got back to me about a question i had within 30 minutes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed - virtual envelopes to help us keep track of spending. The app can do SO much more, but I keep it simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's great but the look and function of the widgets needs updating !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Has really transformed my budgeting! It's become addictive now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's good for keeping track of expenses and what's left in categories, but I'd like to have more than 10 envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app to use in keeping and maintaining a budget.  I do wish that it were possible to delete a scheduled transaction if it fails to Sync initially. I'd also like to consolidate envelopes on the mobile app as you can on the Web version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Sceptical at first, but after 2 months of dedicated effort, only realize how wonderful this app is! Great tutorial videos to get me started too! As an expatriate, it would be perfect if there are options to wire money back home country(similar to envelope tranfer), and manage similar expenses and budgets in 2 seperate countries with different currencies. Currently performing it by having 2 seperate accounts. I name it according to its currency, but actual total debts are not true figures due to different currency rates. Anyway, i'm loving this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome alternative to actual envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Truly appreciate this app's ability to keep me financially organized. I'm able to keep an abundant amount of ""envelopes""/""accounts"" to categorize. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to simulate a envelope system on a phone. Wife and I use it well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app cannot add....."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.  Helps me keep track of spending and save for things that are important to me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I LOVE that this allows us to do our budget bi-weekly! Super easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for budgeting! Very user friendly, and looks great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very effective. It turned our finances around."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a good app, we use it to manage our finances and there's not much to it! Great for syncing between partners phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Edit: Thanks for the prompt response, made my day.   Simple and easy to use. But while making entries, for some reason the auto suggest always lists generic or famous brands that I don't use before my commonly used entries."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps my cashflow VERY efficient"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Does what it says. I just found an app that does more. I'm more than happy to pay around $5 to get the pro version. I would have paid a lot more. I'm getting sick of so many services wanting monthly payments. It really feels like a con and that I'm being ripped off."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and intuitive, just what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Two thumbs up! The best budgeting app. we have been using this app for many years now. Quick question: We have been using the free version so far and it has been more than capable to handle all our needs. no need to upgrade but we would like to donate small amount of money as a thumb up... what should we do?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"this app has helped us get on track and save by seeing where our money goes.   Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I wish there were a few more envelopes and the mobile version numbers reset to zero if you have to flip tabs when filling envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the app with the exception that sometimes even though it saves your entry, it doesn't do the math. Deleting the entry and reentering it usually fixes the issue but if you aren't paying attn when you enter it, you don't know which entry is the problem. Without this single glitch, I would give it a 5 star rating.  EDIT..the app still has issues with not calculating the entry. Currently it says my total envelope balance is far less than what is actually in my account. The transactions all match the transactions in my checkbook but the balances do not match, and my bank statement agrees with the balance in my checkbook. This had gone on long enough. I think I'm done giving my money to this company. I'll be looking for another."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Luv it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and elegant. This app is almost perfect.  For a free budget app it works great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and neat"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app provides exactly what I need for managing my budget.   Very easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really handy app that has allowed us to keep on top of all our spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use for a pocket budget and has lots of expandability for more complex budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app for finance I have see!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very convenient to input transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my family on track with spending. Very easy to use and see where our money goes. The goal envelopes are wonderful. I love meeting one of them! We have them set for kids birthday parties, travel and our savings account. It also isn't tied to any account which gives us peace of mind if someone were to get my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Outstanding, simple way to manage a simple budget for your family or team. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it promises and without costing a penny for most people's uses. God bless you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for budgeting!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a very helpful app. Thanks to the developers"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great with being a gazelle and sticking to a budget. Paid version is worth it for extra accounts. No crashing or other issues."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what my wife and I needed. It’s a pity we can't afford to upgrade to the full version. We wouldn't mind paying a one off upgrade cost of say $20."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for the past few years, still loving it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of your expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app. I used the free version and loved it, but I wanted to keep track of more accounts so I'm paying for it. Not disappointed in the least."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use.  Saves us money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is fantastic! Runs circles around Mvelopes, Every Dollar, just to name a few. If you have any question, Support can be reached via FB Msgr 24/7 and their response is very fast, sometimes immediate! KUDOS to the devs! Keep up the great work! 👍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app for budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Still the best budgeting app out there for me, esp. b/c I get paid every two weeks.  Would be nice if they allowed me to sync all of my accounts like Mint does, and let me pay billed in the app and see what my net worth is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and a great app for personal budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great! It has worked for recording my freelancing income/tips as well as regular pay checks. Expenses can be conveniently imputed without data or wifi."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of what you have in the bank and what you have left to spend for the month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic and very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple...because managing money is already hard enough"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love the paid version to help us keep up with checking and savings accounts and credit cards!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once I got it set up it was easy to use. We looked for a budgeting app that would allow us to measure on a biweekly basis and this does!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it for my home budget and it works like a charm"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and understand. Well designed training videos in the help."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy being able to stay on the same page with my husband as to what's being spent, when, and where.  It probably has been good for our marriage!  Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best for tracking expenses! I've been using this for 3 years and it's helped me pay off $15k in debt. *Update: Still using this app everyday - two additional years later. It really helps me keep on track. I use different envelopes to track expenses categorically (groceries, household, gas, spending) which helps me see when I'm overspending in a certain category and helps evenly divide household expenses with my husband. Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Really!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"By far one of the best budget apps on there. This keeps my household budget in perfect balance. I love how the web interface and app work together for on the go input of transactions. The interface on the app and the web interface are a little dated, but I don't mind as it functions how I need it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy way to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just the right app to keep the wife and I within our budget and informed about where we are financially at any given time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this simple and easy way to keep on track of  my budget. Love that I can access it on the PC as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years now and it's excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for tracking personal expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Would be alot better but every month when i go to add funds it keeps adding to buduget amount, never resets, so unless i take all the money out it adds to it. Very frustrating when you try to live in a budget every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app! I used to use apps that linked with my bank account and autopopulated my information but I find that I am more aware of my spending habits having to type things in mself and this app makes it quick and easy to do. Only wish that I could click on a category in the reports pie chart and be taken to the transaction details for that envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I absolutely love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, visual, effective. Keeps my budget in check and keeps me accountable for my spending. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's good. Wish I could add more people."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app. It does what I need it to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app thank you so much! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Once you understand how to use all the features it is a very useful tool for budgeting expenses. You can not track debt though such as credit cards and loans without subscribing unfortunately. I understand you want the revenue for more features but it's free to look on my banking app to see what I still owe. You are not giving your users something they don't already have access too by withholding users from having multiple accounts (cheque savings visa loans etc). If this app ever removes free version I will switch to a different app that is free. But please allow multiple accounts. People pay if they want more envelopes. Looking at account balances is easy enough for people to look online, why not cut out the 3 seconds it takes for the users to open their bank app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app - have been using for almost 2 years.  Reports are pretty good but if you are a true excel nerd you can export a csv and make your own."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to control personal finance"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works the way i want.  No ads no hassle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great practical app for Dave Ramsey financial peace University style envelope budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeping tab on my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good for budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for years, I wish I had more envelopes for free but honestly for a free app I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, works well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best envelope app out there"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I just downloaded this app about a week ago and already love the features this app offers... One of my biggest problems though is that the app occasionally won't sync. Other than that it is fantastic and a great tool for money management."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The pro version of this app is extremely affordable and has helped me navigate personal finances like nothing else. The app is responsive and intuitive. One of my favorite features is that the mobile app and the website are both well designed and can be used interchangeably. The pro version is almost necessary to track multiple accounts and envelopes, but has so far been a worthwhile subscription. If you cannot afford the pro version, the free app might make that a possibility!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have been using this app for 5yrs and we love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has saved me from worrying about what us going on with our finances. It syncs to both my android and my husband's iPhone and just takes all the stress of budgeting away. This is my most favorite app of all time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Virtual envelopes for budgeting are an excellent tool, and Goodbudget makes it better by tracking your progress throughout the month to let you know if you are ahead, behind or on track. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"always know where i stand with my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GoodBudget has been a great tool to help our family set up a budget and track where our money goes. Very easy to use. Syncs across multiple devices so we can see all our purchases in one place. Great tool. I recommend it highly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app I've used"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great free app. Helps me with my budget and keeping track of spend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Simple and easy to use. Keeps track of when I move money between envelopes, which is my favorite feature when I make a mistake. 😀"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nicely done. Has category groups and sub groups."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the free version. Very easy to use and never crashes. It has helped me maintain my budget. Glad there isn't pressure to upgrade to paid version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Meets my budget needs well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So simple and effective - brilliant!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes it so easy to track spending. Reconciles all our money well. Recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Takes dedication and constant maintence, but it's a great tool to manage and balance out your finances! The $5 a month subscription is a small cost for the additional accounts and envelopes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Subscribed. Great app and service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love using the envelope method for budgeting and this app just makes it so easy to track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It's a good app ruined by an unreasonable pricing scheme."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for managing finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use interface with great ability to customize a simple household budget. Keeps me and hubs on the same page. Has helped dramatically limit our spending and helps us make informed decisions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for budgeting if you're a beginner. Wish it had a reset all funds for the month button. Instead the app will add more into envelopes monthly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's perfect for our budgeting habits. We keep track of all of our expenses. Still only using the free app for my husband and I."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps budget and maintain money. Very nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple but perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a few years now, has been a tremendous help in staying on budget each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app for budgeting, it is easy to keep track of different category of expenses and easy to see what is left in each envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app, love the features, love everything about it. It's makes money management easy. I'd like to extend a big Thank You to the brains/team behind it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the way multiple devices can see the same account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It allows me to do what I want with my budgeting. Other apps pull your bank transactions and it ends up being more work splitting it all out how I want to. This gives me complete control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps me to stay on track with my finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This has become one of my favourite apps as it does its job extremely well and its as basic as it can be. The major downside is that the app/site requires a monthly or yearly subscription service to be able to use all its features.   I'd give this 5/5 if i could just do a one time payment like many other more complex trackers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Yea"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to use and definitely helps to keep me on track. I would certainly recommend this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Interface is awesome, but there's no background sync. I don't like manually opening the app to get it to sync. I want to record transactions in stores without reception, but then I forget to open the app when I get back home which means my wife doesn't get the latest transaction. Auto background sync = 5 stars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lovely concept, well executed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for several years. It is simple to use and easy to adjust when you want to tweak your budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Totally awesome! I use it every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The app closes all the time on my device"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I had just downloaded it. During the setup, when i want to fill the envelope, it crashed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has all the functions but the Cloud thing put this app on top of other apps.... A word of caution it's not easy to use at all.... overall rating excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it ... just what I needed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"all the features are great. The only problem I found is the delay of sync  between devices. and it is not so easy to add the income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only one account on free version so unable to sufficiently assess app's capabilities. Waste of time.  Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy too use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Filling envelopes could be easier (can't find a way to autofill all appropriately)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use is paramount and this app is certainly that.  It best used in conjunction with the website.  The only reason to give 4 stars is the lack of better reports and limited data exporting.  Otherwise, a solid app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep my envelopes in order"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Can't connect, can't create an account... Boo!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app and website.  Essential tool for managing my households finances. Been using it nearly every day for years. Worth every penny of a premium membership."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like that app, but it took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to figure out the difference between adding money to an envelope, and setting an envelope to a specific amount. Once I played around with the app a few times, I was able to figure it out and now the app has helped me track my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great!  We use it solely for budget purposes.  It's not linked to any of my accounts, it's just so my wife and I can see the same budget and no how much is left in each category!  We love it and have used it for 3 yrs now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great. Very useful on managing my budget from check to check and monthly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Replaced our physical envelopes. Way better, we feel in total control of our spending now, and very convenient to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Continue developing the functionality. More reports would be useful on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I sometimes struggle with wrapping my head around the envelope system but the app is easy to use and pleasantly designed. Love the encouraging messages!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up and use. Great app for keeping track of everyday expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Thanks! :) The tag option helps me a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"All good, if you can better the UI and make it more attractive then nothing beats you"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great help!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"1st timer"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly spends tracking app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Especially because it can be shared over multiple devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Everything I have been looking for in a budgeting app. I have been using this method via spreadsheet for past few years but this is fantastic having it on hand!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GOOD Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Pointless if you spend monthly on more than 10 things, yes a mere 10. Ironically you'll have to make an envelope for this app, as you must pay nearly £5 a month to list more! Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent helped alot with my finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful at keeping track of spending & setting budget. Enjoyed the ease of adding transactions especially from the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I generally like this app as it helped me have an overview over my expenses and savings. I would like, however, more possibilities of reporting and visualising my spendings."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been the most useful tool in changing our financial situation. It has really helped us plan ahead and stop living week to week. We love how simple it is to plan and track our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. So simple, very effective. The wife and I have been through the rough and come out with money to spare thanks to this genius synchronising app. Only bugbear - paid version is per month - no outright purchase for life."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helps you and your family to stay on budget. I highly recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. Really love the ease of use. Makes budgeting a breeze. Thank you for such a great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and perfect for what I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For the first time in my life, I now know EXACTLY where my money's going - and more importantly, how much I have left to spend. This is a really powerful app that takes a little bit of setting at the start - but once that's done, it's very simple to record new transactions, etc. The app is backed up by the website, which replicates the functionality and allows you to manage your account. Continually under improvement, Goodbudget is one of my essential apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I always wanted to do a budget and struggled with keeping track of expenses for years. This app has made keeping on track with my budget effortless, as long as I remember to log my expense. I would give it 6 stars if it came with an  assistant to remind me! 😜"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm normally a really big spender, I would waste my money without knowing where it went. This app really helped me manage it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app, this has helped me with my budget so much!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app and easy to use. I share the information with my husband. I pay for mine so I have more options, but I have my older kids use the free version to learn how to budget the money they are earning."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and simple app for budgeting and cash flow report"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just about everything is perfect. The only negative is the cost for the full app. A monthly charge is really dumb for an app like this. If it was a one time payment I would have already paid it, but as it is I will just stick with the free version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app. Simple to use and great functions. The envelope system takes a bit of getting used to but brilliant way of keeping track of what you spend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Concept is good but user interface is not very intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Indispensable family budgeting tool!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's helpful to set aside money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for 4 yrs. Very happy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not bad for the price. Far from being user friendly when needing to make adjustments via the app. Over all I am very pleased, just go online to make editing much easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"PLEASE change the app icon! It's a great app, but it's an eye sore on my home screen! Thanks hehe"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app.  Easy to use.  Excellent reporting"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for budgeting your finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good app :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelope system the have!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you use the envelope system this app is for you. We converted 6 months ago from the PC based MoneyMap software from Crown.  We use it on 1 Android, 1 iPhone and 1 PC (website). Updates between devices works well. There are a few things that are much easier to do on the PC but all in all we are very happy with GB."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastoc app.. really love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy and efficient"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says. Just annoying that certain functions like managing recurrent payments have to be done through the browser."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A good app with easy to use features. Thumbs up for the fast response CS!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"After an update it erased everything. An inconvenience I didn't appreciate.  Uninstalled the app for that"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Game changer if you make it a habit"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has kept my budget on track for two years now. Always my first recommendation for budgeting help."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very convenient to record ur daily exp & to ctrl ur exp"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not the most intuitive app but it has definitely helped us save money as a couple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good at what it does, but not what I'm looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for managing your budget in my case monthly. Easy to use once you grasp it and I'm grateful it's free. Thank you"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My sister uses the envelope system with actual cash money... For me it was difficult since you don't carry a hand bag... This is my virtual envelope system... I'm in love with this app... It has made me so finance conscious... I used to borrow money now I I'm the one lending it has changed me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's really helped me and my husband budget a lot better and now we don't have to argue over where the money is going. Highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Has since helped me track and organise my finances so well. App is stable and presnted in clear manner. Also easy to search previous transactions. Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Some day I'll be a millionaire and it'll be mainly because a long lost rich relative will die and leave me their wealth. But when that happens, I'll put it all in smiling little envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent application, the most advanced in the free tier. Importing  from bank transactions is also feasible. Please make the widget work correctly ;-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The only thing that would make this app even better would be the ability to capture the receipts with the transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app would be better if it had full functionality to amend past transactions and envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app and Web interface make it easy to track your money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I started off by using the free version, which helped me change my approach to budgeting. I've subscribed to the paid version now for unlimited envelopes. It's a fantastic system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and well designed."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for a long time and it really helps me stay on track with my finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Our solution to cash on hand!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Overall - a good app, but not all the phones have a big device storage, so some users would prefer to move this app to an SD card. It would be nice to remain there when the updates are installed, like other apps. Could you please look into this and fix it? Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how you can created different envelopes for spending. Then you also have an easy to use interface. This program really helps you organize your budget and how you spend. The best part is you can sync your account with other phones. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Dislike it has no weekly or forttnightly features"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and powerful tool for keeping the household budget under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Changed my life"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great that my husband and I can both view the same budget on our separate phones"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"easy, simple, and very helpful. few enhancements needed: 1. rotate display 2. ""sync"" option while in all tabs 3. automated sync 4. archive envelopes 5. more reports 6. extended period of logging (currently 5yrs is the history limit)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Хороший тул. Мы уже 2 года пользуемся"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used to draw up a new budget from scratch every time. Now I have a living budget huge quality of life upgrade."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Perfect if you're following the envelope system of budgeting. And if you're looking for a great budgeting method, the envelope system works best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have tried many budgeting apps, this one nails it. This is because it makes me want to open it every day - because it's rewarding to see exactly how far ahead of budget I am on each envelope, both in exact terms, and visually. (How green is the bar compared to the position of white marker indicating today relative to the month as a whole). I had a surplus last month for the first time ever. Cheers guys."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use this all the time. It updates live across all of our devices so we know exactly how much we have at all times."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent for tracking spending and budgeting. Love the envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has made budgeting for my household SOOO much easier! Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for a few years now. It finally allowed us to get our spending under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent, well designed software with good intuitive help routine *****"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The user interface has a bit of a learning curve to it, but once you figure it all out, it's a great way to keep track of spending. Now if I could somehow link it to Samsung Pay or direct to my credit card or in some other way have it know when I spend, how much, and where without me having to manually input the data - perhaps push a notification to my phone when that happens to prompt me to enter any missing details... that would be awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It can be a bit confusing to setup but once it is all going, the app is really useful for tracking spending and sticking to a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best. Free is great, premium worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to be successful at budgeting with this app! Eliminates bulky individual paper envelopes and messing with filling them each month. Makes sticking to my budget FUN!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Really helps keep me honest with my money 💰."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Keeps force closing when I try to manually fill envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for years. I recommend it to everyone!  I am able to budget to the dollar and that makes me feel more secure when I spend money. I know I CAN afford that dinner out because it's in my play money budget :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's empowering to update every day and know exactly where our budget stands."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good budgetting app, but I have problem with editing transaction into ""Split into Multiple Envelopes"", it's not working."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Apps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I think this is the best envelope-based budgeting and finance tracker app in the market. Loved the features. Happily bought paid subscription!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is a fantastic app and does what it sets out to do. There is a bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is fairly intuitive. Kudos for the level of functionality offered in the free version which in itself is good enough as a family budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the idea of envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for keeping me on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and track finances.  I love being able to see exactly how I'm doing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is prefect"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The layout of the interface is boring and not structured like a budget should be."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am fully convinced that this app saved my marriage, honestly. We are able to effectively keep track of all of our finances together now and stay on the same page. We managed to get away from living paycheck to paycheck using it. Thank you so much."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app but it will never sync to the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very handy. easy to use., Works great. Update: 5 years later, still loving it :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I absolutely loove this app! It has been so helpful to me and my wife! It's amazing! Just wish the free version made two accounts available."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app to keep track of my spending :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use it constantly. One of the most used apps on my phone. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Gives me what I need. It lets me budget without jumping through hoops."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, useful, simple and convenient to use app! For the first time in my life, I know clearly what's going on with my spending-!!! Thanks--!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Now easy way to share the expenses between husband and wife!!! It is a Handy and Smart Notebook!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app for not having to link accounts and manual entry. Me and wife have access from respective phonrs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I love the concept and execution of this app but have now owned and used it for a month and not need able to sync my data a single time. It does not like HTC One A9's!🙁"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping up with transactions on the go. I love how this can be synced between other household member's phones and the website. I do account reconciliation on my laptop, but most everything else on the app.  Some sections do have different functionality on the app vs the website and there is a quick way to go to the web from the app without having to log in if those are needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great money managing app ever!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to help you keep track of your spending and stay on budget. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Find this app really useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for keeping track of my spending and helping me to stay within my budget. Love the syncing option so both of us see the same thing in real time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it as virtual envelopes to the Dave Ramsey envelope system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"App is pretty good. Bad payment scheme. I will never use a subscription plan for more envelopes, especially since they may poof of I turn off thr subscription. However, I would definitely buy a single permanent envelope at a time as my needs grow. Add a single envelope purchasr option and your company will probably make bank faster.   Life would be easier if payees could be managed better. I would like an option to view my entire list of payees and be able to edit them. For example, if I ended up with three payees Mcdonalds, Mcdonalds (with a space after it), and Mcdonald's, I would like to open a payee list, edit one (to make them merge) and the change to be applied to all transactions under that payee. Editing payees is painful since you have to edit every transaction in your history for the payee to make the change stick. Ridiculous."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent budgeting app, very handy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good interface and syncs fast between web, Android and iOS."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like this app for personal accountability. I didn't attach my account, just using it to keep a better track of what I'm spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.  A real game changer for the tried and true envelope budget system.  Such a good app. Highly recommend.  Also use it on iOS.  Great on both platforms."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works very well for watching your budget and documenting all expenses. Just wish they gave more free envelopes. 10 just isn't enough."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps a lot. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've spreadsheeted our budget for years tracking every dollar and analysing expenditure. This app has a few shortcomings (can't have a 4 weekly pay but can have a 4 weekly expense) but overall is superb as an all in one budget tool. Wish we could transfer between envelopes in the app. Well done overall. Worth my $45 a year."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Needs a UI/UX refresh but it is awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great way for my husband and i to keep a simple budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We're old YNAB users. Goodbudget is better than nYNAB."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Little complicated but easy once you get used to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that it syncs with the family, great for helping to stick to a budget and keeping the family on the same page!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years to manage my money and figure out the best way to save. Helpful and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's awesome! Just get it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks is app has been very handy for my wife and I to organize, allocate, and track our spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app, would like to see individual envelope widgets that show amount remaining in envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wish it had more free envelope to set my budget. Anw, it is good enough to track my daily expense"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"app crushes. plz add a tutorial on how to work around."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. My wife and I both use it every day!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, clean interface, lots of flexibility, helpful tutorials. 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a really great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use to keep up with spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Don't like to log on. Just want to use the app. Don't need all this extra waste of time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has made it possible to save money and plan long term for bigger purchases and vacations. With the extra envelopes, we've even taught the kids to save and spend their own money responsibly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like the ability to schedule payments and automatic debits. Seeing scheduled payments on a calendar would be a nice report to add."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is AMAZING! I use in line with Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University envelope system. It has really helped me stick with it & make it work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Have you never heard of anyone getting paid every FOUR Weeks!! A lot of people do including me but you have Weekly pay and two Weekly but no four Weekly, how hard would it have been to include four Weekly guys, apart from that it seems pretty good but I can't use it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app. Just wish it were a one time purchase, not a monthly / quarterly subscription for full access"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic budgeting app.  For an envelope-based budgeting system.  Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you want to do envelopes and don't like the idea of keeping cash with you this is what you're looking for. Initial setup is easiest at a computer and daily tracking can be done on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app to manage your income and expenses.. very well done built app and very intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lets you do a cash envelope system without cash."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Many apps now sync with banks which this doesn't. Their answer is to download the transactions from your bank and then reconcile manually. This is just too much effort and headache. Use a tool like mvelopes that offers free back synchronization and also allows for receipt capture and storage.  This tool is well behind other applications purely because the fact that they don't link with other bank accounts.  This tool does have pretty good reports though. If it had bank synchronization and receipt capture and storage, I'd come back to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Didn't like interface"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app opened up communication for my husband and I about where our money is going! Thanks for saving our marriage one envelope at a time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It crash too much"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Took me while to figure it out, could do with a better 'how to' intro. But great once set up, automatically accounts for monthly outgoings and incoming and let's me assign any left over cash where I like. Love the reporting feature."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Allows you more control than other apps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Splitting an expense between envelopes is extremely hard"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps our budget on track. Automatic updates weekly. Synched on  both our phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use, once you get the hang of it. I like that I didnt have to connect my accounts to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of expenses and budgeting. Free version still offers plenty of versatility if you lump expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"My expectation was once I set the budget in all envelopes, it will automatically set them to 0 and only keep recurring expenses rather everything is carry forward to the next month as it is.  So difficult to keep track of individual month budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It looked like it would have been useful, but it crashed multiple times during setup.  I never got through to actually using the app as a result."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. It was difficult to get started but easy to use and maintain. Getting started instructions are very needed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Hi, I really like the simplicity of the app. I find it to be easier to organize. However, I would like the option to have a weekly and monthly budgeting period at the same time. I want to see how much I have left to spend this week and how much I have left to spend overall this month. And some categories may be used on a monthly basis rather than weekly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy.  Just what we needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Quick, simple, easy family budget. My husband and I have the free version on our phones and it's been a huge help to manage our combined spending. I wish we were allowed more free envelopes - we can't afford $5 a month for an app and we don't need to monitor our bank accounts. If you've done the Financial Peace course then this is a must-have!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crappy app does not allow for biweekly and monthly expenses at same time and kept crashing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have used other personal finance software and I have to say this one ranks toward the top. It has really limited reporting, but more than makes up for that by easy and straightforward banking transactions importing, simple to use interface, and very reliable unlike some other bug riddled software I've used."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Gimmicky. Only allows you ten envelope slots for monthly expenses. What is this: a video game?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and user friendly application! Definitely recommended!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep a budget synced between my partner and I."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like this app it works well for me....my only issue is I find it a wee bit confusing to add income"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"pretty much useless cant edit or update anything properly makes incorrect calculations on account dispite input being correct. have to inconveniently log into the site to do anthing effectively. the list goes on"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it! This is the best!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"While I find some features a bit confusing it is the best app I've tried for general envelope budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The easy and modern way of balancing your checkbook"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I found good Budget in an article in Forbes.  The article listed top 10 apps to help you budget. I  like that I can go laptop or mobile to update/ print.  I paid the $5.00a month, so I could have more envelopes- for first 6 months. This helped me see where I am spending. An allows me to really reign in the budget. I had hard time setting up certain areas, but I have it now to what works for me. An now It is very easy to use. Easy to record right when you spend so you don't forget. I have used lot of others an i think this one is the best so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The envelopes allow for some good flexibility in how you want to represent your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best basic Budgeting application I have found."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"$45 a year just for an app? Are you guys in comedy? The app is NOT free. Only ONE acct, INCLUDING CASH, renders it useless. Only 10 envelopes for free. Searching for alternative."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been a lifesaver when it comes to my budgeting. I ended up paying the extra monthly fee so I can have unlimited envelopes. No more paper envelopes and no more hassle of taking cash out of my accounts. I would definitely recommend this app and have to several people."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is very good, this apps help me to monitor my spending, now I know why is the money goes to. Thank You"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The envelope idea is the one I have been looking for long time. Exactly that What it is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really like the customizations. You can see what you've spent and have left all on one screen.  Still really glitchy and crashes. Been using several years so makes it very frustrating. But has everything i need so patiently waiting for fixes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"exactly what I was looking for, helped give me control over finances. perfectly happy with this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It would be a 5 if they offered more envelopes without the upgrade for $45 per year. Other apps provide more but I prefer the functionality of this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent. This app helps me a lot. Would be better if the free envelopes are added to smoothen the reports."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's making me so much more mindful of my spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use envelope app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice envelope system, exactly what we're looking for with the ability to sync multiple devices. Helps us save by recognizing our spending habits and identifying waste."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Manual entry really helps me keep goals on focus."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I find it really hard to manage. I've added 10 envelopes with money in them but it shows me the amount is 0.00 and when I'm adding what i spent it goes negative! But i only started and I've only spent 16 euro... trying to change it somehow and can't find where the problem is... Update: Finally managed how to fix it. Thanks for the answer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, useful, effective.  Have been using for a year now, and it makes it really easy to enter transactions and track against budget.  Super simple to transfer funds from one envelope to another.  Replaced the previous monopoly money plus envelope system we were using, and makes it easy to see your current balances at a glance.  Super cute envelope expressions!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Handy and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the app. Its meant yto help u stay on budget. Its easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I used to be a paid subscriber, but getting frustrated with bugs and lack of updates."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Needs work, I'm gonna try Mint...looks much cleaner plus its free and has more features...give this app a try maybe it will work well for you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking your spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good for us to track how  much we are spending on the credit card so we don't get a surprise at the end of the  month. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"No Password - id be glad if there is an option to put an application password."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works great!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has the features I need to track spending without the pain of entering a bunch of financial data"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me to stay on top of my life with ease!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really works well. Simply does the job."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Of all the budget apps I've tried, this one seems to be the most logical for what I want. It seems clunky and the little smart ass envelope is annoying, but this app just makes the most sense.  All the other apps try to make things way to complicated by trying to help you pay your bills and integrate with accounts, which seems like a security nightmare. This one simply tracks the transactions you input. I left this app looking for something better, but will probably end up coming back."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"integration with the web browser got me. five stars to you guys"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Perfect for basic envelope budgeting / expense tracking, shared with a partner or small family"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic tool for budgeting made easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Limited to 10 monthly items"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has all the features I was looking for in a budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it, been using it for years when I want to get a better handle on my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app! Love that you can track monthly expenses, plan ahead for annual or semiannual charges, and set long term goals!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app since 2012 and I'm still loving it! I switched from iOS to Android and there was barely a learning curve. I'm so glad that I can finally see my scheduled transactions on my phone and post them early when I need to. Keep the good work, Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good App, use it on a daily basis"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, and the paid subscription is worth it. We've had a few issues,  but support have responded quickly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for envelope style budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love being able to keep track of my household budget and learning to live within my means! Thanks for a great tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"it was confusing when u need to do the budget first before u start record the expenses. it will be difficult for beginner as they usually dont know their expenses behaviour for the first month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It's probably a great app, but it kept crashing during my attempt to set up my budgets. I never got to full app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only allows you to have 10 monthly bills."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of groceries. Fuel and spending money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This works so much better than quicken!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great envelop system with online account backup. Easy to learn and use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to customize. Keeps me on tract."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has saved so much time and effort compared to the spreadsheet method I used to use for budgeting. It's quick, simple and manageable to keep track of spending on the fly. So glad to find it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't like 3rd party apps having my financial info.  So I just want something that easily let's me keep track of my budget and spending.  One thing that would be awesome auto scanning and saving of receipts. Update (9/29/16) still using it and it is really helpful in sticking to a budget and tracking expenses. Still would like ways to automate receipt recording."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you like the Dave Ramsey envelope system, you will like this app. It's pretty easy to use, convenient, and fantastic for organizing and keeping track of your money. Even if you have sporadic income instead of fixed income, it's still great to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For free, this is one of the best. You have to track your expenses manually, but the budget makes more sense than the one Mint uses. This app keeps track of your actual money, not projections of what you should have. It's clean and direct. Been using this for years and it just keeps getting better. Love the new charts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"If only there's other currency, it would be great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helps me keep on track with my budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had used physical envelopes for years, and was pleased to find an app that was just like my normal budgeting system. I have really appreciated all of the features that allow me to connect to my bank account, and the ability to sync with my other devices including my husband's phone. It used to take me an hour and a half to do my budget, Now it only takes me 20 minutes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep reality in check."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is just so convenient to use. The hardest part of keeping a budget is keeping track of cash purchases, this made it super easy to track for my wife and I. It has helped is a ton."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I would like the option to enter my receipts daily."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Didn't really care for the app at all"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. In the first week I saved myself 1/4 of my paycheck. It makes budgeting really easy, if you understand the envelope system.            Update: I still love this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having used a variety of online envelopes systems over the past decade, I can honestly say that Goodbudget has been a joy to use. Less noise, no bugs or annoyances, and more focus on the ""right"" things needed to follow the envelopes way. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, very helpful. I can only recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app really easy to use and helps manage my mine a lot better than anything else I've tried"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love this app. It was exactly what we needed to help us get our finances in order!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So simple and easy to use to keep track of my incomings and outgoings. I use the envelopes to see how much I've got allocated for what so I don't spend my bill money. My income is set to disperse as planned so it's super simple to enter. Very handy having it on my phone so I can enter changes as I spend money out and about."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for 3 months. Very happy with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried to use another system, but came back to the envelope system. It really works for me! I hope this app continues to offer a great product because I plan to use it for a long time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I really wanted to like this app but unfortunately, it doesn't allow me to adjust my income from month to month.  Every time I make in edit, it adds that amount to my existing monthly income (throwing my budget way off).  For this reason, I'm uninstalling."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is really helping me stay on budget. Having to enter transactions makes me less likely to spend a little here or there. Use this if you want to use envelopes but mostly pay with debit cards!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"THIS IS A GREAT APP"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"App crashes when I try to fill envelopes individually. Also will not sync with web. I've been battling with this for several days because I really wanted it to work, but I've come to the conclusion that this app needs a lot of work still."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Really opens communication between the hubby and I. We both always know what our account looks like. Really keeps us on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app and the website are perfect for tracking my expenses it really helped me to understand where my money was going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"User friendly and useful app~"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really appreciate this app. But it is seldom updated. What keeps me looking at other apps is the lack of updates and new features. Eg I'd like the option to merge envelopes, analyze my spending and much more that can be done with huge data I've invested over the passing year."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I signed up for the $5 a month access so that I can have unlimited envelopes. By far the best app out there for my budgeting needs. Worth every penny!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Solid sync function..thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps relieve the stress of wondering how much of the cash in your pocket is for groceries and how much is for coffee. I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! I have an android and my wife has an iPhone. ..no issues!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is such a good app.  Does everything I need .  Well done team."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wife and I have been using it for years (since back when it was called Easy Envelope), and we love it. We chose this app over all the others for its ability to sync over multiple devices, and have been very happy with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like the envelope system a lot however, it's easy to screw up and once you do that, be prepared for a lot of calculating and moving stuff around to get back to the amount you actually have. Also, once you spend money out of an envelope, it doesn't take into account that you have already spent that amount. For example, I spent $45 out of my grocery budget for the month. Instead of showing that, it just shows that I still need $45 more instead of showing that I met the budget and then spent out of it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"First app that has made me budget properly and thoroughly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App kept on forcing me to pay for upgrade and would not allow me to use app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Can we have ""weekly"" and ""bi-weekly"" budget periods? I know they can be multiplied to reflect a monthly budget period, but for those of us who are poor folk living paycheck to paycheck and the paycheck is weekly or bi-weekly, it's easier to budget that way, idk."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using for two years  and love it! Once you are used to how it works  it is easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has definitely saved me and my wife 10 times the amount it costs. Well worth the expense."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app takes a bit of time at the initial set up and takes time also to learn the difference between the 'envelops' and the 'goals'. That said,  it helps me to keep good track of spending. Awesome free app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a few years now. Love it and recommend it to all my friends"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to help with budgeting. I also appreciate that I can share my budget so my household stays on track and that I can visit the website to do everything the app has. I highly recommend Goodbudget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Feedback"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very convenient and syncs seemlysly between desktop and mobile"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This tool helped me get a firm grip on my finances.  I think it has been 7 years and running."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps a lot!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a virtual envelope system that works great with my busy life. I can enter my receipts on the go and keep track of my spending with ease."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A nice balance of simplicity and features/options. Does personal budgeting well. Works great with Dave Ramsay style planning. Free plan works great for getting started, but paid plan is worth it if you decide it's a good fit after a few months."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it helps my husband and I be on the same page of our finances!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years now and is super happy with it. In an easy and simple way it allows me to keep track of my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"As far as I know - only app of its kind where you can do a proper envelope system with manual transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There are a handful of UI things which I feel could be improved, but overall it is quite functional."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps my household manage our finances well. Now everyone's on the same page and we have less quarrels about our spending differences as long as it's within the allocated envelope 😁"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this to balance my bank and credit card accounts every week. If you're good with accounting, you can get pretty creative with the envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good and intuitive app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It'd be great to be able to sync this with my bank accounts so I can stay on top of all of my transactions, fees and interest! Especially Australian banks :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Seamless sync to account is the killer feature"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"God this app is great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for tracking expenses in different categories and staying on budget. Have used for years!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I want to love this app... But I don't see why it needs access to my location.. if there is a logical reason I will update my review. I'm curious as to what the reason it.                                          Edit: ok, that makes sense, still not a fan of it.. but it makes sense. Changed review from 2 starts to 4. Would be nice to be able to omit location permissions for those that are paranoid, like myself. Edit #2 ok, you sold me, changed to 5. Thanks for the help and the prompt reply."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I know it's your company color but it would be great if we could change the color scheme because it's not very pleasing on the eyes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can match it to my accounts exactly.  I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love Goodbudget, have been using it for over 4 years and it works very well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Tried several apps but very few offer both Envelope system with web access. Easy to use. Still I can't use this and will uninstall it because my wife and I need about 18 general envelopes and 3 accounts, and paying for a monthly fee is not part of our envelope plan, will consider for a one off payment. 10 envelopes doesn't help anyway. This app almost replace my Excel and my current app. I'll come back when there's a new plan"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not overly complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This really helped us get our budget organized.  The sync is the key."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It had difficulty syncing. I thought there was an error with the servers(like it told me) and it would come back. When I emailed the company, they were unhelpful, said to go manually track on computer and re-login on phone. I would have paid for premium if this hadn't been an issue. The point of an app is to save time with budgeting and now that's moot. Be careful, esp if you're paying for it.  Regarding the reply: having to log on a desktop computer defeats the entire purpose of having it on a mobile phone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app makes it so easy to do my budget on the go!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to track money and build a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We installed on everyone's phone, and kids have own envelopes to budget. Lunch, recreation etc... Dont spend too much or you will be taking a pb&j for lunch next week."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I used this app for 10 months before paying for a 1 year subscription in the expectation that I could then share access to my wife and also transfer it to my new phone without loss of data. I then discovered that due to a bug in it, it cannot sync and therefore if I lose or break my phone I lose all historical data and current budgets. Emailed support but they did not even attempt to fix it and just suggested that I login to their online site and encode my previous 10 months transactions!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An easy way to do a joint budget, where you can with together with someone (or I guess it would be just as good with one person) to budget. Adding transactions are simple, it's an envelope budget that works easily with debit cards. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Kind of hard to learn to use, but that's to be expected with a budgeting tool. Budgeting is tricky. Love the sync function that keeps me and my husband on the same page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Might need some time to get used to the envelope system, as the interface is not necessarily intuitive,  but then it's fine"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app and they are constantly making improvements and updates. I have used this app for a year and I rely on it for budgeting. It's awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Basic and great for the whole family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wish I can choose the day when each bar has move forward. Because I have kind of budget that set for weekend, and the illution of ""I still have much left this weekend"" kind of frighten me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After YNAB went web app this has replaced it for me and it's the best budget app around imho."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I hate dealing with cash so this is a great solution since I want to stick to an envelope system without the hassle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for a while and love it!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The main reason I got this app is because I didn't have to connect it to my phone. Tracking and recording my purchases using this app is easier then writing it down on paper or using Google excel app. It keeps me informed of my financial position, and engaged. I don't have to do extra work in reorganizing my purchases categories."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful. Very much!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this app and it has helped us keep a much better budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its working well. I hate being on a budget but this is helping us stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good but messy when you change your cell"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best. App. Period!!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried this app again on a new Samsung tablet. I can get a bit farther into the app now, but it still crashes a lot and is unusable.  Also, it bugs you at every turn to sign up for an account on their website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easier than most other budgeting apps. Exactly what we were looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple. Use it everyday."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can you make it simpler?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Its so great to have it on my phone and be able to enter entries on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm so thankful for this app, and I've recommended it to numerous people. The other budgeting apps I found wouldn't let me customize the start date to my budget, and since I get paid on the 15th, having my budget restart on the 1st didn't make sense. I'm still using just the free version, and it is working for what I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Some friction points make it overly complicated for my use case but it's pretty amazing otherwise"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the best budgeting apps I've found! Based on the tried and true envelope method, this app is financial responsibility meeting and falling in love with millenial technology and way of thought. Way to go Good Budget!    EDIT: I am actually coming back almost a year later, because I still use, love, and depend on this app. I actually just paid for the Plus features, because I love this app so much I want to support the company by purchasing the product  (even though I could have continued with the free)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Please consider the following suggestions: #1 Keep my settings when I log in and out (like use of calculator to enter transactions and keep default payees cleared). #2 I don't need every transaction going back to 2012 downloaded every time i log in, just the last 6 months is ok unless I need more. #3 I'd like to be able to clear/reconcile transactions on the app as they clear my bank account. #4 Simple toggling between multiple households."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very handy. Shame you pay monthly for subscription. Would be better to pay one off."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This will stop you going over budget and help you see exactly where your money is going. Love that you can create your own envelopes for whatever categories you want. Has definitely helped me keep on track with my spending. Great app. Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's easiest to set up everything through the website, then use the app for keeping track of purchases, credits, etc."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Seemed promising but crashes every time on note 5, Uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget planner.  Enough said."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It takes a while to understand the user interface but the budgeting power that is creates is awesome! Will recommend it to anyone who is trying to get a grip of their spendings."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best thing is my husband and I always know how we are doing, financially."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to stay on track with this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope style budgeting is really working for me. Good Budget has everything you need to get control of your money. Sadly the demo will probably not work for you as you can't cram everything into the envelopes they give you. Program only starts working for you once you pay."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has helped our family a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For my needs Good Budget is more flexible to fit my budgeting needs. With YNAB I found that if you don't follow their system to a T you'll never fully reconcile their vision of your budget against the real accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Very helpful in monitoring my expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful in managing monthly income n could track my transaction."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does what it says, keeps your purchases categorized and logged, not to mention you have a record of purchase amounts, so you can catch fraud as it happens.  Fringe benefit: NO MORE FIGHTING ABOUT MONEY!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app note longer syncs with the desktop version, rendering them both useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy way to check and keep record of my expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can you add currency?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"No more check book for me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. The plus version is something anyone can live without, so the app isn't just about making money off of us. It syncs when online but can be used on the metro when I have nothing to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It is easy to use budget app, but I have problems with syncing and occasionally messed up budget that I have to adjust it every month to correct it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This occurs when first setting everything up. I can't fill them individually. Crashes. Only way past the app is by letting the app fill everything for me. Great for people who fit this ""fill em up for me"" situation. Sucks for my specific use case apparently."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This thing is confusing as all hell."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good that you can use 2 devices and also web interface. Would be lovely to have 2 bank accounts in the free version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, simple options, no complaints :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app with good design."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"You get limited free envelopes, and then they want you to to pay $5 subscription fee... Advice? $0.88 spiral bound note book from Big Box Mart.. or real envelopes.. it's cheaper."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for over 3 years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I really liked it until I reached my limit on envelopes in one time period. There shouldn't be a limit! Or at least higher than 10."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried more than 10 apps and goodbudget for sure is the best. Simple, easy to use and the most important that make it different with its competition is the envelop concept which very effective to handle personal finance. Bullseye!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app overall but not able to reset password"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to have if you live by a budget. I've tried several other apps and this one is way better and user friendly for me. Thanks to you who created it. It helps tremendously!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The envelope system works great. I'm traveling long term and this has been extremely useful in keeping on budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You have to manually input your pay every week . Notthing automated. Not user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice. Simple to use, syncs with other droids and home pc, and tells you where your budget stands at a glance. I would like the option of giving the developers a contribution for the free version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If I want to reset the transaction for each of the envelope for next month's budget, do I delete one by one of the transaction or there is other way?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a year. Love the budget comments that pop up. ""Hmm. Negative money. Interesting..."" ;-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After the inital set up a lot of the payments automate"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Would be even better if it allows for screen rotation and a transfer funds button direct from main menu/banner (instead of on drop down menu)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I would recommend it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I made a deep research before choosing this app for budget manager, and I am very happy with it! I use it with my wife across iOS and Android, and both apps are stable. Sometimes I made changes in past transactions and every change went smoothly.  Awesome job developers!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am not at all good at keeping track of my spending and this is such simple and easy way to manage it.  I love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely useful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very good app.  Just needs a few tweaks to make it 5 stars."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has helped me structure my finances to get a home loan on a flat and hopefully pay it off in 6 years!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps me to keep my budget on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works really well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used multiple apps in trying to find the best way to manage my money & to me this is simply the best. Not only is it easy to use but it offers flexibility in how you can track your finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"After further reading from the website I saw the option I need in the paid version. But paying a monthly fee for the service isn't feasible when I am using the app to try and juggle the finances to try to pay off debt. I've broken everything down to weekly amounts to try to make it work. How about a one time program fee instead of monthly payments. I would pay a one time fee to get the full featured program."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me manage my accounts.  Works great for both my spouse and I.  Very user friendly and easy to set up and update."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This thing is AWSOME on every level, especially for those of us who suck at keeping track of finances. I think it's even better than Mint because it gives the option to transfer funds from 1 budget to another."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Bad user experience. Because the app needs a lot of steps to setup the budget. Updated my review to 5 stars for your fast response to my review."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use the website & my husband and I both use the app. It works very well & helps us keep track of our money and stay on top of things. We've been using the website and app for over a year. In that time we've paid off debt, saved money, and still had money for fun"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you keep up to date with receipts it is easy to find what you are spending. There needs to be a function to let you adjust how much is in the account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is keeping me on track, clean interface & easy to use. I picked this up after some time away, and I'm very glad I did."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app, I wish it has little bit more reports"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use it regularly. It is really great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great expense tracking tool to help keep us on budget. Only app I have used that allows my husband and I to  use the same account which was a big plus for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had been a contented user of YNAB until they changed their whole system. I researched a lot of budgeting apps and found this one to be most suitable for my needs. The app and the desktop software all very configurable. It just does what I want. Appear to be a friendly bunch too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We use to use real paper envelopes for budgeting when we were first married and it was helpful.  So this digital format is helping us once again."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Must use for home management."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Plus a lot of other cool features and a lot of options for refilling/expensing your budget. Never tried the premium but I don't need anything else. No crashes either."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay within my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool for keeping a budget, helps to see where money is going and what needs adjusting, love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Need more practice on distributing funds on each envelope. Maybe it is good if you provide tips to have more efficient exercise."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I needed a budgeting solution that we could share. It needed to fit our complex finances while being simple and intuitive. Goodbudget hits all of these points."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"By far the best app I have tried so far, however I have yet to find an app that allows for my use of the credit card, because paying with the credit card is easier tax whise we do most of our payments via CC but all the apps for budgets assume cash or debit transactions, I wish that an app would allow for choosing the type of method used for the payment of the transactions. Also because we pay with the CC our payments are different than what it's proposed in most financial apps and this app had carry over.."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like the way this app syncs in real-time, so that my husband and I are able to spend within our agreed budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"simple to use and functional but I dislike that you can not budget bi-weekly. you can only do a monthly budget.                                 Edit: ohh I see! Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.  It makes budgeting less stressful."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not sure if it's just me not being able to find it, but id like to be able to set my month start and end dates. I'd like to plan my budget and track expenses according to my pay day - so I'd like to set the start of the month to the 13* ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"this app really helps me budget and stay in control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once I figured out some of the finer points of filling envelopes, it became quite easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to set up and also to modify.  First time I tried it I was making it too complicated.  Start first just setting up the envelopes with your budget numbers and then just put in your transactions as they occur.  It will feel great to see instantly if you are on track.  No need to link with your real accounts.  If you do want to connect them, do it a little later when you really are comfortable with the system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me get my life together"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I do not want to give access to my accounts and there is no functionality around this. What a shame."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to use. Hard part is understand the core concept of it and online web versions. But when you will understant those, you will find how easy and useful app this is. Free vesion is totally ad free."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use...we enjoy it...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The premium version is worth the upgrade, but used the free one no problem for two years back when it was EEBA... thanks for helping us stay on track! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for explaining how to do something I couldn't figure out, now I am super happy with this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I love Good budget."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over 2 years now. App really helps me try to stay within my buget. I like that there's a built in calculator, rollover for next month and the dark theme. Really like the addition of sceduled payments. I highly recommend this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice but a could improve documentation"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My family and I have been following an envelope system for years and I always hated carrying around envelopes.  And switching around then forgetting...Good Budget is better than any envelope budget or any budget at that! I paid for the extras and am so glad i did! It takes a little getting used to so I recommend reading all of the information on what and how to start and be successful at it.  Thanks!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this all the time to keep us on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to work with and does the job. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This a great tool. Simple and efficient. If you want an app to keep track of everyday family finances, this is the one you want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great and free!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the way it helps keep track of everything I spend. It me balance my check book better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use it daily. It works wonders for me. Some functions are easier via web access but overall the app is great for keeping track of your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If it wasn't for the manual entry of this app, I would overspend. This app keeps me very disciplined. I have an extremely low income but I was able to pay off my student debt, move out, pay a downtown rent, AND at the same time go out and enjoy the pricey, unique restaurants. I've used this app since it was called EEBA back in 2012. This isn't for everyone because it's very, very manual and tedious -which is the reason I LOVE it. This app or Excel. GREAT APP FOR BUDGET TRAVELLERS. Thank you so much!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the multi device and ability to use on a desk top too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps with simple budgeting, and has flexibility to keep goals realistic."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Bug: Adding to envelope and topping up envelope do the same thing. If this works correctly on the website I will still use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The main difference between this budget app and others is that, instead of showing you how much you have spent, its focus is on how much you have left to spend. I was skeptical but it really changed my mindset! I think budgeting is half planning half mindset so this app is really valuable. The free version gives you 20 categories (10 monthly, 10 yearly savings) and 1 cash account. I'm single with just a checking, savings, and credit card so this version has worked well for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ties in with the web site really well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to personalize and use without the excess."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps us organize our budget every month. It's so easy to enter receipts as soon as you get them and stay on target."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I found this app to be an excellent tool to help me get into better spending and budgeting habits. Since installing this app, I have not had any trouble with overspending or missing due dates. I highly recommend, especially for teenagers/young adults who are first getting out on their own. My only advice is that you need to be diligent in recording your purchases in a timely manner or it will throw your entire budget until it's corrected."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has absolutely become a mainstay in my daily routines. Easy simple and effective. Has saved me many times from spending too much..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wish I could change the colour theme. I personally really hate the exact colour (Turqoise/Aqua-ish) of the interface. Dark Theme is way too morbid. Nonetheless, I won't allow this to affect the app's true performance... Another thing this is that I wish it has more graphic details (in minimalistic way). All I can see is words and words and words. Too bottle-necking, overwhelming the eyes. Overall, it's great. Keep it up!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps keep me on track with my budget. I do Dave Ramsey and use this app for it. Perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"GoodBudget helps keep us mindful of our spending and trying to stay within budget. Reminds meet of the actual envelopes my Mom used."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best budgeting app ever made. Clever UI, great experience, amazing collaboration between accounts and envelopes, everything perfect! This app made us realize what exactly we are making and where to improve our spending habits. We went for the paid subscription so we could keep track of cash spending too. No regrets!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and easy way to start budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and extremely customizable. I'd recommend this to all looking for a budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Another all in one finance manager to help sort out the finer details of the trusted ""envelope"" system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well and is all you need to manage a balanced budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the interface, very easy to use once you get it set up. Been using it for a year now.  Great job on this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works exactly as described and flawlessly at that! I use this for personal and business accounts. Great for contractors who need to allocate money in and out for separate customers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great on tracking expenses monthly. I don't use it much for budgeting per se but helps me categorise expenses and watch if we go over board. The reports and charts help too .... this is good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"While other apps might be  excelling at personal expense tracking, this one is quite unparalleled in keeping track of your family budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple app that doesn't require me to link my banking info.  Syncs up to 2 devices for this free version. Update: still using."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've using this more than 1 year. Find this app useful and help me to manage my money. Keep me on track. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is so very helpful to our family. I find it easier to use than Mint."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"works well, does what we need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep my money in order, been using this for quite a while now and has really sorted out my finances. Hopefully ones day it will tie in with my contactless payments, that would make me very happy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been waiting for a cloud-based envelope-style budgeting system with good mobile access and synchronization. This one finally meets my standard. Thanks GoodBudget! I am looking forward to the ongoing development of an already-great product."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Kept our budgeting on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helped us to manage our budget and finally get set up to buy a house!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not automated enough"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome for keeping track of debit card expenses and setting money aside for special items."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can manage my income wisely"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Although not perfect, this app has been wonderful to record a budget track our spending and have open conversations about our finances. To improve, I wish you could easily see how you're envelope is going this month alone. Adding some of the graphs available online to this app would improve it also. On the whole an awesome app and I would recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool, more manual than other options but I prefer that so I stay aware of what is happening with my money. This app and the website are easy to use and can effectively keep you on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I finally found an app that actually helps me with my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Converted over from Dave Ramsey's money envelope system. Easy to use and keeps our family budget on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's just what I needed! Hope this app stays like this and never starts displaying one particular currency symbol ($/£) before the figures like other apps do. This allows and encourages people globally and especially from developing countries to use it. If you guys have any plans of making currency symbol visible, please give users the choice to choose their currency symbol. And make sure you guys put up symbols of developing countries also."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use and no adds!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep the budget on track... Easy to use with great features!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic envelope system app! Just wish it was easier for me to reset them each month. And I wish that we could have just a few more envelopes without fees. But really a very helpful, simple tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just wish it was a little more intuitive when adding monthly funds. Might need some tweaking. Overall, it's very handy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So happy with how goodbudget allows you to track both your budget and your account balances. Also love that I can add transactions quickly on multiple phones, then go to my computer and work with a full keyboard to check against my bank statements. Update: keeps getting better steadily too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for couples"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, website is very good too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not so user friendly but it's the best budget app I have used,  and yes I have used quite a few"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the envelopes that help separate each budget category."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tells me how I am doing. Easy to use. Much nicer than being lost on where your money is going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you're not budgeting your money you'll only be left wondering where it went!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like where the app is going but I have many requests and suggestions I hope to see fulfilled :)"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Sync feature always showing a popup telling you to try later."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Let's you budget categorically in advance."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 3 years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have reccommended it to friends and family and will continue to do so. I also upgraded to the paid version for unlimited envelopes. I think this app is even better than YNAB and it's cheaper!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have found this very easy to use. Excellent HELP menu gives step by step instructions how to set things up. If you're needing to budget better this app is for you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The free version is usable with two devices and the new graphs is a good step in the right direction to add functionality to the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! We love it. Have used it for 3 years now. Much easier than paper envelopes, but with the same results. We can use our budget to rein in some spending while making sure we follow through on long term investing goals ( education, retirement)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So organized."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been an excellent program, helps keep me on budget. I tell everyone about it."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use Goodbudget every day. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Intuitive interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for months to track my monthly budgets and expenses, and it has been a lifesaver. It is easy to learn and doesn't have a ton of unnecessary features to sift through. However, I wish it had a ""transfer funds"" option to move money from one budget to another, which I do a lot at the end of the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best budgeting system out there. Great customer and technical support and accessable through the web as well. Why it's relatively unknown is a mystery!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Great way to budget! A few little glitches but still great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app allows you to see where you are every month to make your goals and budget possible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have yet to find an app to just keep up with checking account(that I like and don't have to link to my accounts).  I don't necessarily  use this for budgeting but just for money spent.  Being able to straight out link it to two devices  (no Dropbox etc) is perfect for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I'd learnt to do from an early age through the local 'Credit Union' who would help you budget out your funds for the year. Fantastic system. Only suggestion would be more detailed examples once people have paid for the pro service - what to perhaps group together, what to include you maybe hadn't thought of yet like yearly costs such as registration or rates. Still a fantastic APP and helped me convert my BF into a budgeted for life! &lt;3"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I would like to be able to use more envelopes on the free version but at this point I should just buy it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budgeting app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Still awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Needs a little self discipline each day but it's a wonderful concept, easy to track your expenses and plan your savings"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've been using cash for about 4 years now and it got significantly easier when we started using GoodBudget. The fact that it communicates between 2 smartphones and the website makes it easy for my husband and me to communicate about where our money is going, even if we aren't having frequent budget meetings. Even the free version is a great product!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love how it syncs to other users"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has helped me keep a lid on my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Relatively simple to use and very helpful in tracking spending; very satisfied with the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes a bit of getting used to filling the envelopes properly but works well and simple enough..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A practical budgeting app, the most highly rated personal budget app that can be shared online."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple efficient and fun"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great basic budgeting app. I've tried mint and another that connect to my bank account,  but they were frustrating to me because they didn't show what you were putting on credit cards, and they mis - categorized many purchases. With this app, I use it like I would with cash, and withdraw money like I'm spending it then and there,  even if I'm putting on credit.  Wish there were more envelopes,  but this is free so can't complain."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for almost a year now. I wish a few things were different, but overall great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelopes allows you to see exactly how much you have left for each specified item."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great one"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this application"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My family has been using this app every day for a few years now. We manage our constant spending budgets like blow money, eating out, and groceries. I never have to wonder if we have the money for xyz anymore. I know instantly with this awesome app!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The feature to add #tag to an expense is absolutely brilliant!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'd be stuffed without this app. Highly recommended. Once I'd set up my budget it's so easy to record all my transactions and account transfers. Particularly useful to see at a glance how each envelope is doing against the budget period so I know when to rein in my spending a bit. The free version was good enough to record most of my spending, and therefore keep my finances on track. But the extra accounts and annual envelopes are well worth the subscription fee."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very practical, very usable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It gives me perfect data each time! Fast loading and easy to mange. Great app."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good budget app with lots of features including web access and backup."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This works great across users and is perfect for my son and wife who are currently  in two different locations working off one checkbook.  Syncs great with the computer also. All questions I've had have been answered as links from the help menu. Haven't used any features to sync to my bank but so far I love this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hey, I don't mind ads. Please add an option to have unlimited envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app is simple yo usr but I have more bills than it aklows me to put in, without payong for the service currently five dollars a month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is easy to use and it has the features that i like. i think it is best if a feature like BUDGETING SUGGESTION based on your expense history will be generated by the app like ""spend less 10 on snack to cope up with the budget within 30 days"""
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would have given it 5 but account balance is not recognisable and keeps changing without any new transactions!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Goodbudget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a phenomenal app. I've recommended it to everyone I know. The best way to really keep track of expenses and financial goals. Plus there's a mobile app, and it doesn't have to be directly tied to bank accounts, so there's security. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Crashed twice in a row on my phone after adding a couple envelopes. Opened it on my tablet and my envelopes were gone. Tried to add an income account and it said I had reached my limit. Considered the Pro version but reconsidered when I saw that it was $5.00 a month. If the envelope method was that hard Grandma never would've used it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Would be good if upcoming transactions could show in the envelope total..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Generally good. Sometimes when using the split into multiple envelopes  feature, the balance computation wasn't done or system hang."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"essential part of my budgeting strategy... I love this app! simple to use and easy to access"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Paid version with every penny to keep accounts and budgets synced up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Never had a budgeting issue since we installed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple. I know I'm not using it to its full potential. But so far I'm loving having my spendings tracked without always looking at my bank account or losing track/interest of using pen and paper"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use and extremely useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works well with how I like to organize and overall it's pretty user friendly ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So perfect......"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Using free version and although could do with a few more envelopes it works really well for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Hands down, best app I've ever downloaded"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loving this, used for a year now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love being able to track my budget and spending on the go!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use; also good for synchronizing between my phone and the web. EDIT 9/4/2016 - just noticed that I can finally view scheduled future transactions on the app; this helps a lot!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like the fact that it doesn't carry a dollar sign and its js nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I can keep track of everything and it is very accurate"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app lets us see exactly where the money goes.  We use it for everything we consciously spend money on.  It is useful for everyone for something - kids, adults, couples, young and old."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: I can see all of my upcoming transactions! Awesome! I absolutely love this app! It's the only budgeting software that I've ever been able to keep. It's great that I can manually add my expenses as I make them - so I know my budget is up to date. Plus, the update has great report capabilities, so I can more easily manage my budget when I'm on  the go!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome software"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I have come across for simple budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I installed this app in my android phone in this hope that there will be widget for quick entries.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good budget maintenance app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what we needed. We've been on the weekly envelope system 4 weeks now and haven't broken our budget once. The best part is being able to share it. My husband and I can birth update it, so we always know how we're doing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app out there bar none. Others have more sophistication but simplicity is what is needed for a tried and true method of Budgeting envelope method."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is really good. Bought the premium version. The transition month to month is a little challenging."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Got it because husband and I can both access it. Use it. Love it. It's revolutionised our budgeting and finally made it possible to save properly. Great stuff."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The syncing between devices is one of its best features. The ability to have budgets and envelopes is a better way of handling money.  I recommend this to anyone needing to control their finances.  Duane They added reports making it even better. D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Rated good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like it but wish you could have more envelopes without paying"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GoodBudget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I just couldn't figure out how to fill envelopes. And the app by itself wasn't very intuitive. For e.g. I did not understand what the black line meant, Although I figured it out later. However it's a brilliant app for budgeting. I have never kept track of my finances this keenly before and it actually helps me curb a lot of my impluses. So that's a lot of money saved.!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy way to bring envelope system into the 21st century. Millennial approved!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very helpful. This is exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Trying it out & it's very practical thus far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's excellent in the free version. Create your envelopes and manage your budget. No more looking for bills or pay slips. Just add it and you'll have a permanent overview."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.  Very useful runs well on multiple versions of android.  Keeps multiple people in sync with where our budget stands in real time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best Money Management I've had by far"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! I think it does many things that it has to, and has the ever useful web app to look at different graphs. Since it's free it's definitely a good start for serious budgeting.   There are some things I think would be even better. For one, being able to change the start of the month (to the 23rd, when paychecks arrive?). Another is a way to treat savings and investments. I think savings should be a default, and there should be a way to distinguish this from other forms of expenditure. This also means being able to move ""leftovers"" from the other envelopes into a savings envelope.   Manually doing it is fine, so thank you so much for the capacity to do this in the first place! Love your app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best one that I've tried so far!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you use it you can really help yourself stay on budget. I love that my husband and I can both log our transactions throughout the day from our phones!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall this helps my husband and I keep track of our expenses but there's no way to easily start over with it. It would help to have some way to completely wipe the slate clean and start over without deleting everything."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple and useful app that help me budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of spending and you can view it and make reports with graphs which really helps. Having multiple allocations in the one account is really useful for managing finances aswell."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using this app for a year. Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband is have found it easy to use, and it has helped change our spending habits!  We upgraded to the pro version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great syncs between iphone and android flawlessly easy to input data quickly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple. Really great budget tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using the free version, and so far it's an excellent tool. When learning how to budget, it's better to have to manually enter your expenses as you spend because you're actively involved every day. The envelopes get ""sad"" when you're spending too much or too fast. It automatically distributes a monthly envelope's budget across the month and estimates how much you should be spending based on how much time is left - very useful for keeping track of grocery expenses! Add sync: A++"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"When I choose ""set to budget amount"", it rolls over the previous balance instead of just setting the envelope balance to what I want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Still enjoying this! One thing which would really take it above and beyond would be to have receipt tracking. Some times I'm not able to immediately input expenses on the go which leaves mr with a ""chore"" at the end of the month. Scanning receipts would address this pain."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelope format with easy drop in, take out logging."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"EEBA helps my family keep track. of exactly where our money is spent.  Its also helps us plan for the future month and stay current with our expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried out quite few and I love this one!! I'm pretty much obsessed with logging my spending now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what you need in an electronic envelope system!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how Good Budget lets me not only set a budget and track income and expenses, but also use the envelope system to assign certain amount of money to certain places. I love that I can choose whether or not amounts roll over, and that I can have ""goal"" envelopes without specified fill amounts per month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used it for ages and it's been so helpful. Especially as both my husband and I can access the same info so we know what our budget looks like every day. Only thing I'd  change is different colors for different envelopes ☺"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't know what I would do without this app. I have used it daily sents I got it on my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have absolutely loved using this app! For the first time both my husband and I are on the same page and both in the know with our finances. We love adding to the savings envelope and seeing it have a party!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes it so easy to keep track of spending and saving and gives you a visual way to track progress. (I mean, what's better than getting confetti when you reach your savings goals?!)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple. Love that 2 people can contribute to the same budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"2nd fav budget app so far. Nice and simple. However, there needs to be a tutorial. I have no idea how unallocated money works. I have money remaining, but the remaining money doesnt automatically go to unallocated money.  *Edit: Company promptly responds to questions which is a plus. Remaining money still doesnt automatically go into unalloacted. I have uninstalled and found a different app that has a tutorial and fits my needs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I don't understand exactly why everything's set up the way it is. Maybe I'm dumb idk, it's very confusing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps me stay financially organized"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Daily app user here."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for a couple trying to start budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great little app. Easy to use and only location as a permission!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an easy to use daily budget app, this is the best app for that purpose. I am very happy with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's superb!! Mind blowing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have it on out phones and can update when we spend and it provides a great look at our spending habits"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for keeping track of your budget month to month. I have been using it for almost a year now and could not be happier. Easy to use and great for organizing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My family recently started budgeting, and after trying several other apps, this one is a winner.  It is rewarding to use, and actually encourages us to keep budgeting.  Highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Pain to use and adjust budgets with the stupid ""envelopes"" uninstalled, use EveryDollar instead"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent to use, simply great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"super helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how we can set up our envelopes and use the app on multiple devices simultaneously."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I used to budget on paper and would have to remember to check it and update it while at home. Now we can check it before purchases where ever we are!                                              We still LOVE this app! We have been using it for 3 years now. I love the reports and being able to compare our spending to previous years. I cannot imagine not having this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's super easy to use and helps me stay on track with my budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can keep track of EVERYTHING with this awesome app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an app to track my purchases against my monthly budget.  This app does more than that, but that's all I use it for, and it's perfect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We now keep track of our money better than ever. I love that the app syncs across all devices so wherever we are and whatever we're doing we can keep track of spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This budget app keeps my spending in check...if I don't cheat and remember to input my expenses. Any discrepancies between Goodbudget and my bank account is entirely my fault."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So much easier than actual envelopes. We've used this app for about a year. It helps us stay on budget and is very easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps me budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried the free one, bought the full version, and we love it. I takes a bit to figure it out, but once you do it helps a lot. I recommend this to everyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and a great way for multiple devices to use the same budget system. The spilt option is very helpful for quick recordings of expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really like this app. Keep coming back to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have a shared bank account with my wife and this app helps us manage our spending. Knowing how much is left to spend after bills saves us so much headaches."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried several budgeting apps and this one is by far the most user friendly with the same results as others! Highly recommended!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've used envelope budgeting before, but none as easy and simple as good budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps me save my money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I have on my phone!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and simple, no ads"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for family budget to track together"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Eagerly awaited the arrival of everydollar for android from the Dave Ramsey team thinking I'd replace Goodbudget and I have to say, Goodbudget blows everydollar out of the water along with every other app out there including Mint.  I'll definitely continue to use this app.  Dev, you did a wonderful job on this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works just like QuickBudget app I had for my Treo phone, only this is even better! Thank u for a great app that even my daughters use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please add weekly budgeting to the list."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good way to budget, love the splitting everything in to envelopes and having every $ allocated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The concept of this app is great and i like the visual of the bars, but it's a little tricky to figure out and i end up having to do stuff on my pc because of how it's set up. So far so good though! I wish it would automatically take any leftover money in envelopes and put them either in savings or goals though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for couples. The sharing of expenses across multiple persons is really great. Would like to see more instructions as far as usage of app's steps. Other than that it's stellar."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Practical & useful app that helps manage your finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was simple to learn and can be used for a basic envelopes budget. It also has higher functionality for a more detailed budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We used it to keep track of our ""cash"" envelopes and it helps us stay organized"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I might upgrade to premium"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super app. A real help with budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Tells us when the other person spent money. Much better than looking at the bank balance. Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I won't say it again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The Best budget system out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Lowest I could choose was monthly. I get paid weekly and would like to go off of that. Looks like it would've been great; it's just not for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works very well and does exactly as described."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I feel like I finally have a grasp on where my money is going!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not the most instinctive concept"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app and the web page.  Easily split pay checks across designated envelopes and budgets.  Also gives great visual and reports on finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"App is helpful, simple, and a great way to track expenses and progress toward sticking to a budget. Much easier to use than another envelope-based budget app I tried."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"User interface not quite as smooth as ios version but otherwise very good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I charge almost everything and this program makes it so easy to keep track of where those charges should be allocated in my budget. It's so easy to use that I manage to keep it up to date, something I haven't been doing with my other budgeting solutions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for budgeting. It helps you save money and spend on what is important. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really hard to understand initially but once u get it it is really comprehensive!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how this app allows you to create easy to use envelopes for your budget.   My family used cash envelopes in the past, but they were never easy to refill. With this system we can easily fill the digital envelopes and keep track of how much money is left in each category.   I love the convenience and the fact it can sync so quickly with the rest of my family members."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is what my family wanted. The old style house budget keeping app using each envelope and sync with every family member enabled my family to keep track expenses hence efficient budget management. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easier than real envelopes... Helps us a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love! Only budgeting program I've used that makes sense. I love that you can put in your monthly amount for a bill and it will tell you how much you need out of each paycheck weekly or every 2 weeks to pay that bill. LOVE IT!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has really helped me keep my spending in check."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just Amazing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its functional but it looks a little drab"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budgeting app. Simple to use and works well syncing between two users and different devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelopes without using cash - fantastic!! Saved a few hundred in the first month already. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, and the form for each transaction is super quick to fill out. I would recommend it to others. 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a bit tricky to get started, annual budget amounts are presented a bit awkwardly, and the transfer/fill envelope process could benefit from being a bit more visual and clear."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little confusing and takes some getting use to but not a bad app. Using free version but I would say the paid version would probably make more sense having more options/abilities."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because it doesn't allow multiple households from one email account. So I have to log out and log in to second household. I have one for home and one for my sideline business."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me fine tune my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app, easy to use, need more accounts but good basics"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good for small household"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and sync with pc and iphone nicely"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The only add that would.make it better, is another account on the free app for debt or credit cards so we have a full picture"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that my fiance and I can see the same budget on our own phones. It is not overly complicated like other budget apps I have used. It allows for 2 incomes that deposit at different times, such as bi-weekly and weekly. It lets you make and name your own envelopes and allows for a ""long term"" savings goal, such as for a savings or saving up for school tuition. Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly. Would be easier to setup reoccurring income and expenses like rent, cable, etc. Couldn't even setup the income so uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for over a year now and it really helps me budget my money. My only problem is lately it has not been syncing to my husband's phone or our computer so those devices are not accurate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and the little envelopes make funny faces if you spend too much or too little, which makes budgeting ever so slightly exciting. What sets it apart from other apps for me is how flexible it is. It lets me input things manually, which takes some getting used to, but ultimately helped a lot. I actually felt like I was spending money, which never happened when I would just swipe my card. Makes it feel more real when I have to input it here."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like this app because my husband and I can share the endless more easily than carrying cash, but I don't think the app is very user friendly. Every time we refill our envelopes, it takes us a good five minutes to remember how. My husband days the website is a little easier to use, but what's the point of having an app if I'm just going to go online to do my budget?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best managing app for personal bugdet"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A bit of a learning curve & it is cumbersome to move unallocated to envelopes  (easier online), but otherwise I like it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Enveloping method is much better than just looking at the past or cash forecasting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good tool to track, drill down and throw a chart in face of everyone to show they over spent. Keep up the good work. Any option to integrate with existing services like google drive?  Just a flat for should be suffice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like my title says: it's good, man. If you keep your envelopes up to date with all your transactions it paints a clear and concise picture of where your money goes each month. It's good to know that stuff, man."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Like how it categorized everything.  I forget everytime to fill my envelopes n have to learn it all over... But it maybe just me being forgetful :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Intuitively laid out. Great program!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is  helpful. I found that checking out the website and help articles was necessary for working out how to use it for variable income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I never give app reviews, but I logged on specifically to say how much I love this app. Great design, easy to use. Made budgeting such a low-commitment habit to start. It tracks how much you've spent compared to how much time you have before your paychecking, letting you know of you're ahead of the curb or suggesting you don't spend for a certain number of days to stay on schedule. Now an integral part of my life."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"When it comes to saving money i am bad. But with this app I have saved money and stayed on budget. Its a excellent app. Using the full version now and its excellent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for what I needed. Allows me to track my spending and clearly see where my money goes each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app was ok. A bit hard to navigate for what I was trying to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I had this years ago and I like the updates but I could've sworn there was a way to distribute money evenly when filling envelopes. It helps when it's not a lot you're adding at one time and you don't need it in specific envelopes but rather to boost them all a bit. Is there still a way to do this without manually dividing it up that I'm missing?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed to track how I was doing on vacation. Love being able to see individual transactions and see how much is left in food vs souvenirs envelopes. Really helped my family make good choices and return from vacation happy. No big bill waiting for us due to overspending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really useful to keep an eye on our finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried other apps. Nothing else helps me budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My favorite budgeting tool, and I've tried them all!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Saves me money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for budgeting, available for iPhone too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to track progress throughout the month, and free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Such budget!  Very wow!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very easy to set up and use. My husband and I have tried several other ways to budget, but this is super easy and convenient because you can quickly enter in spendings and check how much money you have left to spend on the go. I would like it if the reports could be broken down by week as well as by month, so you can track how you're going in the short term."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am a college student, wanting to stay out of debt and become self-reliant. The coolest part of my day is going into the app and realizing I CAN budget and that it is so simple. I love that you can customize the envelopes and also see all your transactions. I recommend this app for anyone who isn't familiar with budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelope system. It's convenient and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've found this app to be remarkably easy to use. There is also a website for days when you have more work to do. Obviously it only works if your track everything, but that is the point of an envelope system. You can have up to twenty evelopes, which is more than I need. The evelopes can be set to refill whenever you want. They can also be set on a yearly or goal basis."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this software but will want an offline password added to the features. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"it works real well for my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very useful"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very helpful in organizing finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Grear"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use it several times a day anf it works flawlessly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just started using it last month and it has helped me to save alot!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it... most of the time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a budget app, bi-weekly budgeting especially. The only 2 things I need now is the same level of account editing as the web version and a protection pin for the phone. Then it'll be perfect. Thanks again for your hard work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Find Goodbudget very helpful to keep track of spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Took some time to figure out unallocated but works like a dream now"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am not any better at saving it. But at least I know where is it going. 10/10"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budget made simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thumbs up to the developers"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Efficient and effective!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Intuitive organization and incredibly easy to use. I'd give it 5 stars if you put back the option to auto-fill your envelopes with their budgeted amounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that both my husband and I can enter our purchases and both see the changes right away. It is helping us stay on budget. I love that if I have a large expense one month, I can save up for months and it shows overages next month when I overspend so that I am forced to get back on budget. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for more than 5 years. I even subscribe for its premium service. Couldn't live without it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The envelope system is good, but the add transaction interface is terrible. I shouldn't have to explain to you. Just go try some other apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love being able to share envelopes with my spouse without having physical envelopes#"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's ok enough"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool for keeping up with your spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GoodBudget is my favourite app by a mile. I've been using it since early 2015 and I'm in a daily rhythm with it now. It helps me track my finances in such a quick and easy way and it's helping me pay off my overdraft while still having fun! I love you so much, GoodBudget. I think we'll have many more happy years together!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like that i have a list of everything I'm spending. It makes me think twice about what I'm buying and if I really need it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for about 6 months now, and I've finally been able to keep a budget. It's really easy to use, and I've never had a problem with it at all."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Wish though it had multi currency..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had always wanted to monitor what things I spend my money on to enable me save and allocate monies appropriately.Thank goodness I found this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A perfect budget app. Exactly what I've been looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, fantastic for all those careful budgeters like myself"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This digital envelope system is so simple, I can budget various categories and track my spending!! Its amazing how simple an idea this is but how effect it actually helps you avoid over spending! - app was a little tricky at first to full setup but now it's 100% accurate! Also love the sync feature which allows our household to stay on budget in real time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"A little cumbersome to use and understand- maybe a tutorial would work nicely. However it's still nice to have a picture of what's going on in my finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been looking at a lot of different apps trying to find something as customizable as this one. I can edit the time period between envelope fill ups. If I have 30$ left in an envelope for gas that has a beginning budget $60 I can either add $30 to get back to $60 or add $60 to have $90 in there and jus accrue an extra balance for emergencies. This App is very functional and easy to use. I wish I could though maybe change a theme? Tht would make it more fun."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"That's nicer app to management of budget for sure"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good for budgeting, keeping track of expenses and synchronizing with bank expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app. I suggest to make it zero-knowledge though"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After playing around with Goodbudget for a bit, I realized how much it would help me. So I paid for the subscription. I now have more money in my account on a monthly basis than I did before because I can see when I should not be spending anymore and where my money is going. My husband gets paid every other Friday so my primary envelopes are set to every two weeks. In the other section I have envelopes for the various bills and Goodbudget tells me how much to put in the envelopes every pay day!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The most simple yet most customizable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app helps me a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful! Has helped me stay on budget for about a year now. I think the website is easier to use then the app though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for helping me keep track of my purchases!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's like a virtual fpu!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a phenomenal app. Really helps my husband and I keep track of our expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever used"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the fact that we can now be on the same page when it comes to our budget. Thank you for making it so easy to use! ☺"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have always been very neglectful concerning designing and consistently following a budget.  Our family has suffered as a result.  This app is the practical answer that we have needed.  We are now consistently budgeting and looking forward to better financial days ahead. I cannot sufficiently state how thankful I am for this app and its accompanying website.  I want to express my profound appreciation to  its designers.  I consider this app to be the most valuable app on my smartphone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You don't have to enter private bank info like other apps. Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful!        Have been using for several months now, key issue is that it has trouble splitting one transaction into multiple envelopes,  hopefully this can get fixed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It took me a bit to figure out because I was trying to make my old way work with this. Once I focused just on Good Budget it has worked so well. We are finally staying on track with our money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping up with what money your spending and what your saving. Help my family realize our money  problem and helped organize it. 😍😍😍😍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped our family stay on budget. I love that it syncs across all devices and is customizable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this program. I use the full version and include business expenses. I am recommending it to EVERY client to help them with their budgeting. I am a financial adviser."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a big help to me.  It helps me stay within my budget and shows me where I am spending my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It would be great if you didn't need to buy extra envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can sync my expenses online and it helps me keep on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, helps me keep a monthly budget and stay on track."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It works very well for my wife and me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app! I love it! Simple, intuitive, and a definite recommendation. Must use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! I love how you can see everything all at once!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you stay on top of your finances! Highly recommend it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"But needs work, changing money from one envelope to another is difficult, and so is automated salary fill"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's helping keep eye on your budget. No problem with sync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great little app.  Keeps me straight on my money and budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love this app in our household, both mine and hubby's phones are sync'd to the app so we can both log in what we've bought, so it keeps our spending under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budget app, no permission to account information needed, powerful tools to help control your spending and syncs across multiple devices!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"THIS APP IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST APP FOR ANDROID EVER MADE! Every Android user that is serious about keeping track of their money NEEDS to get this app!  Thanks Goodbudget!~Samsung S5"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keep track of your expenses. Went ahead and paid  for the unlimited envelopes so that it can be of even better use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been very helpful, as I am able to adjust it to my exact situation."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Whatever prediction algorithm they use, it doesn't work. Account always ends up a few dollars off by the end of the pay period. Interface is simple and straightforward, though I would prefer if they had a real two week budgeting system, and customizable options for the start of your pay cycle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps you on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A bit confusing here and there but it does it job"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been experimenting with various budget apps and this one is my favorite! Been using it for 2 years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brings back the joy in budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I initially entered a couple things wrong and I could never find a way too fix them. Nothing seem to balance out. Transfers were hard to understand, for instance what if I wanted to put money in an envelope from my account. Never could figure that out.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use once set up and has allowed me to balance life, mortgages, and salary changes easily. Know how you are spending every last dollar with ease."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and the synchronized function is a seller!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm giving 5 stars based on previous experience. I've missed you EEBA!!! You'll always be EEBA to me. I've tried multiple other apps but I'm coming back because the concept is unbeatable and the execution incomparable...from what I remember. It's been a few years. I'll add to this after an entire budget month. Putting in on my calendar. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy-to-use and has help us save money while paying all our bills on time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm so happy to have this app it makes my life so much easier"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An easy way to use an envelope system without actually having to use envelopes. This app will save you money and it is fun to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Please put a bulk editing feature for a more convenient selection of items. Would very much appreciate it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Why does every app wants people to create an account on their server? So they can store all my spending records /data?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Wants money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Although it sometimes needs to be corrected with some numbers, it's better than the other apps I've tried. And it's free!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The new update is fantastic.   A little harder to use than the first one but the report is a great feature and it was about time you added that bit.  Well done on an excellent app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm so pathetic at maths and any kind of accounting. Totally number phobic so this app is a godsend! Took a few days to figure out from the help section but totally worth it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"love it. I've never budgeted before and this makes it so easy. only problem is I wish there was an easier way to reset envelopes to budget amount from paycheck each month. maybe I'm just doing it wrong."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A good and user friendly tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is so easy to use and lets me keep track of where I'm spending my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using Goodbudget for years (since before it was even called Goodbudget). I love how it lets me take control of managing my money. I can track every dollar I spend and set my limits. I highly recommend it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app with a simple interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps to keep in track with budget. Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes it so easy to keep track of family spending. I've used a few budgeting apps in the past but this is the only one I've ever really stuck with. It's easy to use and has a simple concept. Some folks want a lot of bells and whistles, but in my experience, that just makes keeping track of everything much more confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, just what I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Takes a little bit to get the hang of it, but works well once you learn it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Well built app. Easy to use. I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this site. I been looking for something for finance for the family and it does help alot to be in a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Had a bit of a learning curve but now I think it is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I don't like it bc it refuses to fix my budget amount,  it always reverts back to the one they started me with :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for about a month, best to start a month ahead if you can. You divide up your monthly or weekly income into envelopes and you spend money on things out of the envelopes and try not to go over. The idea is you are supposed to see how much you have left and try to keep it in the envelope. Whatever is leftover rolls over to the next month. One thing I'd like to see is an auto savings. Instead of rolling over have the option to move the leftovers to savings on a set day and for unallocated too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good to track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have used this app for several years and it is on my home page because I use it so much.  Easy to enter bills, it remembers commonly used names, very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good to do everyday budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need it to and can share the acct w my husband!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Free&Efficient, with the widget. Up to 2016.04, no bugs on Xperia 2a lollipop."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Linked between PC and both mobiles to help keep budget on track. Thanks guys"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I just feel sometimes that a few things are not that straight forward as they're supposed to be.. Being a geek I hardly could run with it, but a lot of people wouldn't I believe"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the app and web version easy,clean,simple.  Works great for both of us.  Only wish would be to have tablet version, will not rotate screen when tab is docked to keyboard."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Find a lot of budget Apps and this is the best so far!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Especially for those who want to manage their spending themselves"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It took me too long to figure out how to set it all up. I had to go through and redo things a few times. However, now that I've learned how it works, I'm very pleased with it. One thing I really like about Goodbudget is that it doesn't require me to do more than I want to in order to get what I want out of it. I don't want to connect my bank account or log incoming paychecks, and with this app I don't have to, but that doesn't take away from any of other features I actually want to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use & helps us keep track of our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple. Love the multiple device feature."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I no longer need to take cash out of my checking account and use paper envelopes to keep track of what money goes where. I now just add my weekly pay in and fill each envelope I want to budget for the week. Since we pay our regular bills with my husband's income, I use this app for my irregular weekly pay and misc. expenses. I'm actually excited now to keep track because when I have leftover money after the week is over, I can put it in our entertainment fund. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It does what I want, and it's nicely put together.  BTW: I just moved to the Android, and the interface isn't quite as robust as on the iPhone, but I passed my feedback on to tech support, so let's see what happens."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly. Counter intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its a handy app, I did not have to read a manual, its user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Easy to keep a budget with goodbudget.  Little bit hard to figure out how to set up your income and filling envelopes, but once that's done... so easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Now i know where my money went.. thanks developer!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Im a budgeting freak.... this makes this fact ring true."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use the widget to quickly open the app when I'm considering a big purchase and want to see if I have the money budgeted for it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has made it easy to bring our budget to life.  We know what we have spent, where we spent it and what we can afford."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome options for free use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app.  Simple interface and lots of support"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"May not have amazing graphics, but one of the most flexible and customizable money managing apps!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a huge help in tracking expenses each month!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great to see where the money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works flawless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Goodbudget is very flexible, in fact I believe it's a little bit too flexible. It looks like the developers integrated every single feature request under the sun.. thereby sacrificing ease of use. I'd be okay with the having all these unused options, but when I realized it's not an option to leave the 'payee' text field blank I decided this app was not for me. I did go through the entire budget creation process, though, which took me a good while. Any way, good luck on an otherwise very promising product, guys! I hope you can find a way to make the app a little less clunky."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keeps me on track. I love this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This makes it super easy to plan financially."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used this app for ages and loved it! I always had money left over every pay period. Gave it a break for a while and guess what? Short of money before the next pay. Well, if you stick to it you will see the benefit of even tracking what you spend not just the reminder that a certain bill is due soon. Give it a go. Five bucks ain't much if it saves you fifty. Common sense."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I'm sure it has its place and I'm sure some people may find it useful.  However, I found it to be quite confusing and fairly limited in its features."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Once you understand the envelope style of money managing it's great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"works great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's been great for the past couple of years, but now it's glitching and not syncing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It takes a little time to get used to it but ho man really good app !!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is life changing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you're looking for an app to help you budget this is the easiest app to use I'm so glad i found it so i can know how much money ill have left over at the end of the month after paying bills."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The biggest flaw with the app is that it won't allow splitting purchases into more categories.  For example when you shop at Costco and need to split the purchase into 4 categories it won't."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"There is no option to set budget envelopes for bi-weekly budgeting. Had to delete it, this won't work for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Using it for more than. 2 years.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"There is no reason I should need to give my email I just want to make my own list and have it do the math"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 7 months to stay on track for wedding savings.  Has been super helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was a little tricky getting used to doing the unallocated thingy. But once I figured it out. I love the app even more! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Mint isn't connecting anymore, so I'm looking for another app. I just moved into an apartment, I'm not sure how things will go, I will use this App for sure  if I need to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but would really like ORC capability to make transactions record in a snap!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an easy to use, great finance app. Perfect for tracking your expenses and keeping your finance in check. I love how it is sync'd between multiple devices"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazeballs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"One of the better, clearer free apps but still overcomplicates in places"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that the app syncs with the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My only request is that you make your app compatible with the split screen option on my phone so I can open good budget and my bank account and see them both side by side."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Worked good. My wife and i used it daily. Factory reset my phone now it says I can only have two users and won't let me log in, even after ""revoking access"" on the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We decided how much we needed in the envelopes to take care of our needs and allow us to pay a certain amount extra toward debt.  When you can see everyday how much you have to spend in your different categories like groceries and entertainment, you stay motivated and in control of your dollars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really love this app. It lets me know when I go over or almost over my budget. Pla add more free envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect app to kesp track of expenditure n budgets. Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I need an app for everything and I'm not even proud of it but I need to leave this review how this helped me achieve my goals to save up after just 2 months of using it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I find this very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well. A little bit confusing in parts, not too intuitive to figure out. Would be 5 stars otherwise."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy & Simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use & gets the job done."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app but id like a 4 digit pass code option when opening. Just to keep our details and $$$ private. Cheers"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have premium and like the Accounts feature without having to give up password access to my bank accounts (unlike Mint). It's the only reason I've stayed. May have to leave if they don't add important features paying customers have been asking for, like multi-currency support and printing customized reports. The scheduled transactions cause some glitches, but I love the customer service - Becky is topnotch!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Been using goodbudget (eeba) for more than 5 years now. Would love to see fingerprint security implemented to open the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Don't spend money you don't have. That's my number one rule to honor God, but its so hard to see where it is and keep track. Free version has everything I need to do it though.  I've tried Mint app, but this is the easiest while still making me be conscious of my spending. Physical envelopes just aren't realistic for me. This is the way to go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. Doesn't do what I thought I wanted, but does nearly everything it turns out I actually want. Do wish you could set regular income to be added automatically though..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a budget tracker to help me figure out how much I could save and from where I could pinch the pennies. This app helped me focus on the details and determine where my wasted spending was coming from. I've started a per paycheck, auto transfer, savings regimen because of what I've learned from Goodbudget. I send my thanks to the developers, and wish to say, 'Job Well Done.'"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great so far"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helping a lot.  Can't stop looking at it.  My wife hates me.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app works well for me and family on a 1st time budget. I give it 4 stars because  not able to do weekly and monthly income at the same time. Also  line items dont match in order as seen on website to phone app. Other then that great app for single person or family.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Saves me so much money! And I am able to go without any cash since the app allows me to track exactly what I have in the bank! I have made serious changes to my spending habits due to the report ""spending by payee"" I was spending almost 20% of my paycheck at a local gas station and had no idea! Instantly after seeing that the very next paycheck reported 2%. THANKS GOODBUDGET!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have started saving alot more! Just don't like how it doesn't automatically reset budget each month.                         EDIT* thanks for speedy response! I will set that up! Was 4 but is now a 5 star app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Apps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Add decimal to calculator main screen not secondary"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been able to stay in budget, and it's been great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps us stay on track and see where money is going"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you want to budget your income and expenses this is the PERFECT app, hands down. There is a very short learning period but with their comprehensive, organized and easy to access help data you can easily plow through any minor confusion. Once past the learning curve, I am amazed at how intuitive the app can be. It works perfectly. It is personable. It makes boring budgeting fun. Every time I say to myself, if only they did this task this way, it pops up, as though there is some form of AI on board.👍👍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is just what I needed to keep track of all my categories of monthly spending and savings goals. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have the paid version and this makes it so easy to use, as long as you commit to it!  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of syncing up with your bank account, but the envelope method is a great way of virtually splitting your money and planning!  Unfortunately it makes me see how much money I DON'T have, but that means it's doing its job right?!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Loved it for the first month of using it. Very difficult to figure out the allocating area and unallocated. I simply wanted to keep track of my spending, bills, and paychecks. I do not need to have anything rolled over to the next month. Obviously I am not an accountant. Just wanted to see where I was going wrong with my spending. Very close to uninstalling it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app and tech support is super helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use across multiple devices. Using the free version but might upgrade to unlimited envelopes. Wish you could schedule recurring payments on mobile devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Find it very useful. I can stop asking ""where does my money goes?"" and I can track where all of it goes.  Haven't  mastered my savings portion as yet, but I'll get there soon enough."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It keeps me on track and really lays out where my money is going.  It's like the jar system, without the jars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fab programme"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me kept track of my budget.  I like this better than other apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It doesn't account for spending once a month. Like rent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app it keeps track of my budget and I know where my money is going. The only thing I don't know how to do is how to delete everything every month to restart your month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep me in budget and to help me know better how all my $ disappears."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not functional for budgeting. Asks you to setup your expenses as envelopes & what your monthly budget for each one is. You fill in your weekly income and it calculates your monthly income but then it does nothing with this figure. You must still manually fill each envelope but you can't do it from your monthly calculated wage, the filling must come from ""credits""  you must manually enter. It asks for saving goals but treats them as expenses still and puts you ""into the red"" if you save towards your goal."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been budgeting with this kind of system through Excell but good budget makes it soooo much easier. It's great to be able to access the account on multiple  devices so my wife and I can both enter transactions while we're out. This is such a great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very handy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's not as good as my old app but that couldn't follow me to Android."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Crashes whenever I try to open my unallocated entry, and has a pop up error telling me that it cannot sync online and will try again later (which it has not done successfully yet). I reported the error so hopefully they fix it for other users."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to track where your money is going"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I can see the status of my money at any time. It helps me to stay within my budget. Kudos to the developer. Well done."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. Crap"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helpful tool for monthly expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"My computer and my phone aren't syncing. It took me a bit to understand and it seems really complicated when simpler would be easier for a beginner budgeter to understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like the design and all the things that I can put into this. However, it keeps on saying that it is forced to closed when I press the back button on the top of the screen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"First time Ibhave ever budgeted but the application makes it simple and straight forward. The little mascot is cute as well and I like how it tells you the remainder of your income when you put what you want to spend for month. I also love it's free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like using this app to track my day to day expenses. It works very well and has lots of options. I will consider the paid version for more envelopes, and love that it syncs with other devices!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Solid, functional app with great customer service. Takes a bit to learn, but it's worth it. I can now have a much better overview of my spending and saving. Great stuff!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very practical and simple to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use was lost at first but app is amazing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There are many functions that work better on the website, but this app is great for entering in transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was a little tricky at first getting the unallocated worked out but I got it now and am track to reach my goals. DEBT FREE in 2016"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app works well and syncs good too"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps you make a budget you  can stick to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is very helpful with saving and also can take place of a check register. Love the feature of tracking your spending by envelope helps you figure out what may need adjusting in your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Love that I can sync multiple devices. It's made budgeting and reaching my goals easy, and even kinda fun."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Disliked the features, had a difficult time using it from month to month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I think the app is great and is pretty user friendly.  I've been using it for years and it definitely helps us stay on budget. My only complaint is that the widget is less then 3 icons wide but it is a 4 x 1 widget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app!  It helps me keep track of my spending and bills.  Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best and easiest budgeting aid!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app, helping me keep track :-)  Only problems are limited number of envelopes and all have to be same time period but it seems fair enough that they keep some features for the paid version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great personal finance app for everyone!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice simple app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very simple. Good job."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps us in track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easily the best budget tool available.  Highly recommended!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like this app. It's easy to use, but I don't like that it only gives you 10 monthly envelopes and you have to purchase a yearly subscription to get more. Every other app I've looked at so far gives you unlimited categories. It would also be nice if it had the carry over feature to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having to record each purchase has helped me spend less because I feel the money leaving my ""pocket"". It makes me accountable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's got some quirks to it; like it won't reliably give you additional envelopes when you are trying to split a transaction between more than 2 envelopes, forcing you to go to the computer. But it does exactly what we want and presents it in a useful way. We were so pleased with it that we bought a subscription. But I'm downgrading to 3 stars because the envelope problem is infuriating and it's been a problem long enough that they should have fixed it by now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very well designed and easy to use. My only complaint is that it's hard to reconcile both week-based and month-based expenses. They say this feature is on the way, and with that improvement it would definitely be 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has really been good for monitoring our family budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Didn't stop crashing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes the envelope system easy to manage"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works beautifully."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really works for us to keep our finances in check"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works as expected with no dissapointments"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Only app i have found that both my husband and i find easy enough to use on a regular basis,  but detailed enough to have a good handle on our funds and keep us on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm terrible at managing personal finances and this app just makes it so easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This an abandoned product in an awful state. Very basic, full of bugs, avoid. Ie if enter an expense while offline the transaction is not saved when data connection is restored. Not even a very basic income and expense report included. Moving buttons to top was a bad choice, most people have their hands at bottom. Dev recommended to swipe, however swipe requires even more hand movement and is only available for switching between tabs, i.e. not for new transaction. Controls should be optimized so that the least hand movement is required to reach them."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have struggled with budgeting using loads of other apps. Have been successful with this one. Would totally recommend it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm using the free version. And it has been so so helpful. For some reason it has trouble syncing with the online version. But that's OK. I wish the free version would give us two or three more free monthly envelopes. But. It's nothing that can't be worked around."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The regular ( read unpaid) app if so limited! At least two accounts can be allowed (this will also help get a taste of what paid app is like). Plus the envelopes are really confusing, UI isn't user friendly AT ALL and it's hard to even do the simple task of adding an expense, adding an income and adding a budget limit! Couldn't even find an option to export the data to pdf/csv or any other external backup!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The only l budget management App that I still use of the many Apps that I tried. The concept of envelops is amazing,  the web backed is feature reach."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is such a handy app and easily incorporated and used in my days. The only faults I can find it is that there isn't any instructions or quick help guides to figure it all out at the beginning.  Also the balances seem to carry over to the next month, can't seem to restart the folders for each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Thanks for the help!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best tool on my phone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My bride and I are able to keep up with our purchases easily with the phone apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used the app for budgeting for about 2 weeks. Really useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"One minor thing is that it should allow for weekly budgeting ,not only monthly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Let's me keep track of what I am spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps re-enforce positive habits."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its been two years now and eeba (now good budget) has been very helpful for keeping budget and accounting. Now that I'm married, we're using the premium version. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and understand. Easy to edit. Flexible but keeps me on track. LOVE!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"What an excellent application. This would be further enhanced by being able to group envelopes in the mobile app. As the web based version does a great job of this. Being able to sort envelopes alphabetically on both the web and mobile platforms would be very useful. Controlling the sync time on the mobile app would also come in handy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have the upgraded version which allows me to have unlimited envelopes. it really makes budgeting and planning for future expenses super easy. This app takes the confusion out of how much I need to save and when in order to acheive my goals. This app is a financial life saver!!! :-D I LOVE IT!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has helped my family stay within budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.. have used for years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"User friendly and reliable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Give you more than expected"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It took a while to get used to but i ended up buying the subscription and think it was money well spent. Just use the help guide and their contact us section."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My wife and I can link together and set up budgets for different accounts and try to maintain so we can save! Works well when you can allocate your fund properley."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting easier"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Me and my wife are actually enjoying ourselves. It's really easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Limited use for free users"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use when compared to my other app. I am confused because I went and edited the envelopes when I realized I made a mistake and now both the old and new budget is showing, but the app is tracking based off the old budget. If this was better explained then i would be happy to give it 4 stars!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really love this system so easy to use and we are saving money because of it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best financial app I've found. It's so comprehensive and just the right amount of information."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for beginner with budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for people trying to keep a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Great idea. Not user friendly. Unable to reset budget without making it look like you spent a shiz load of money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tracks stuff well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Some jobs pay on a weekly, or even on a daily basis. I find it hard to use since i can only have one (1) income transaction per month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Reminds me of Dave Ramsey's envelope system. Great way to budget, I like this tracking method. Not crazy about cloud system for my budget information"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app has made a huge difference in my finances. I highly recommend it every chance I get. However, I do wish they'd do an update so I could add income, fill envelopes selectively, and make adjustments to my bank totals through the app. With that addition, I'd give five stars. :::EDIT::: Thanks for the info! I didn't realize I could add my income that way, since I'm used to doing it as a transaction on the computer, which doesn't work the same way on the app. I should have been more clear about my issue with filling envelopes from the app: I can't seem to fill without sweeping my remaining unallocated income somewhere. That isn't ideal for me, but it's a pretty minor complaint and if that's the one thing I have to access a computer for I can live with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's really an amazing way to use the envelope budgeting system without having to take money out of your acct and carry around cash.... It's helped me get myself out of debt and easier to see if I have the money to do so or not. Would recommend this app to anyone who needs help budgeting and keeping their head above water."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Doesn't calculate the amount left over correctly. I add them to the envelopes and its states I have x amount left I go to the next page and the amount left is double. Could just be me haven't got the time to be guessing what each menu is doing and why it's doing it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I think that you don't have to link an account. But adding the funds dose not always work some times it will come up with a negative value so think that can be worked. But I'm keeping the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works as expected, very good features. Only complaint is there is no way to set which day is the ""end of the month"" because not everyone's ""month end""  is the last day of the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Seriously the best budget app ever! We've been using it since it was called Eeba. It puts your finances into perspective & instantly makes you feel like you have more money. Definitely gives you piece of mind."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, used for 3 years. Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Recently upgraded to pro bcse i used it successfully for two years and it kept me on track. With more accounts I have easier control transferring money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Add my income ""Paycheck"" and fill envelopes, but it is not saying that I have no income and all my envelopes are in the negative?!?! What am I doing wrong?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Who ever made this app your awesome keep on the great work and add a donate button"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's helped me stick to a budget, and prevented my finances from spiraling to Hell. Thanks Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I'm trying this app because I need to switch over from Toshl because of sync issues. I like this but now when I try to sync it only shows an error message. Is this a known problem? Will it get fixed?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it every week when shopping.  Great app and so helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I liked the app, I use the free version and I'm thinking of enhancing the app adding check capture feature. Thanks for the development team to reply."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you for developing this app. This is giving me a great start for saving. I don't need above 10 envelopes yet, however will definitely purchase it for more in the future. The app is very easy to use and organized. I've encountered a bug while entering regular income, where it duplicated lines byitself when I pressed save. It was fixed by pressing back button instead of save though. Hope this app will get even better, I see myself using this for a looong time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for running a budget. Well worth paying for the full version, and more convenient than I gave it credit for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, lots of good features. Makes budgeting easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple solution to my budget needs. Easy to use with a clean interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I pay for the subscription -- I really think the unlimited envelopes are a necessity to use this system effectively -- and it's worth every penny for what we've saved in the first month alone. This app has legitimately helped us ""trim the fat."" Wrapping your mind around the envelope concept initially can be a slight challenge, but the app itself is well designed, intuitive, and reliable. Sync is great--my wife uses iPhone and I'm on Android, and we see each other's transactions instantaneously."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Free version has plenty of flexibility."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great for keeping a handle on our account & love that my husband & I can both access from our phones & it is real time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says. No bugs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, and a great way to keep track of spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great family budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time.  Intuitive and adaptable. Hubby and I share an account and keep track separately.  So helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 is due to the lack of ability to add receipts. I would also like to be able to set my budget based on income source, but works fine as is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I would not live life without this app now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple. Very good web interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally i've found this amazing app. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I actually loved this app and would like the pro version, but it refuses to sync on my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm using this apps for a while and what I can find out is the simplicity. You don't have to be a finance expert to do it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I would give it 5 stars but 10 envelopes is just not enough otherwise no complaints"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an app that was simple and could sync across devices, as I need my wife to use it too. Goodbudget is incredibly simple yet powerful: the envelope system is very solid and understandable, the reports, while basic, answer all needs except the most refined, the transactions recording is clear and quick. I recommend it warmly to anyone who's struggling with their finances or wants to get in control of their money. My only concern is with the price: 5$ a month seems to be on the expensive side of things, if you are really on a budget. I might want to contribute some money in the future (I just started using it) and get the premium version. But for 5$ a month I'm afraid I'll be a free user forever, which is a pity somehow."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, Practically  does all the work for you,Cute mascot BUT the icon COULD look Cuter, All it needs is a password protected lock, then it would be PERFECT"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love sharing envelopes with wife. Works perfect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has all the features you want to keep track of your finances yet remains simple enough that it doesn't get in your way when budgeting. I love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not bad, needs a back button"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Of its kind by far!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works flawlessly between phones and the website; life saver!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has saved our marriage!  Now we always know where we are financially!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its great i can keep track of my money easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to put all your different bills as envelopes. You can see money going in and out. It holds you accountable. Plus since it's on your phone it's so easy to add transactions, especially the ones you do with your card that are so easy to forget and go over budget with."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Never used a budget app before but this one's great. Only reason there's not a 5th star is because filling the envelopes every two weeks with the budget for the month makes it a little tricky to see what you've put in each envelope so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best alternative to the Every Dollar app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's annoying that going back to fix an incorrect amount by hitting the backspace key causes the entire value to clear. It's also annoying we can no longer enter a carriage return for the Note textbox using the Google keyboard."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I was excited to use this app until I discovered you can only have 10 items. It would be more honest and Christian to be up front and charge for the app instead of stringing people along. Who only has 10 items?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use... Keeps me on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We found this app just over a year ago and started using it. It makes keeping track of our expenses between me and my wife simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helps me manage my budget. No app could do any better!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a snap when I am budgeting and tracking my spending. Very easy system to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app is straightforward, built on the useful envelope-based budgeting, and stable. One of those rare, helpful apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for using envelope system in today's world.  Virtual envelopes are awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So far the best method for me to budget. The app itself is fine"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool, in conjunction  with Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like that it's easy to instantly put in a purchase. This helps me stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful for keeping track of your budget and is really user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My biggest problem is how it handles credit cards. Another issue is how much you have to do online instead of in the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has really kept me aware of my expenses,  so easy to input!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it. It tells you where all your money goes and makes you think before buying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It crashes all thw time in android 4.1.2"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly I was looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for 4+ years and LOVE it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best finance tracking and managing app ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I think this is the answer to budgeting that I have been looking for. Very easy to use and keep using!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"so easy to use, especially if you get paid biweekly. also great to not have to enter in sensitive account info. also ca force you to get in the habit of checking your budget and staying involved. great learning tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Maybe I was using it wrong but it only let me put in 10 monthly expenses which is a lot less than I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fab"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good idea but you cant add money in at different times which is why i need help as i get weekly, monthly and three monthly payments Edit: will be keeping my eye out for future updates"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Yeah!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app (the free version) for several months now and I think it's great! :) Highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use and change as needed. Great for implementing a budget for the first time or using as an e-register to balance accounts/verify transactions. Seriously recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like it so much we may purchase.  Great App."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps us on track, every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Tool to Keep a Budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has helped me save so much money and not overspend. I have more money in my savings and now I can work on paying off debt. The only thing with this app is the confusion of some of the settings for my biweekly paycheck."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is nice app that helps keep track of what little I make."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped us so much! It does take time to understand and figure out but I recommend 100%"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finance"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app but you'll likely need the paid version for more features."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to do monthly & annual budgets and track spending. I like the status report & pie chart also. Best Ive used."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Helps keep my wife and i on the same financial page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is very simple to use and gives you a great method of maintaining a budget with a digital envelope system. The app is enjouable to use and designed well with a android as well as a fully accessible version online. Be sure to follow the steps listed when you set up your accounts especially if you are adding new accounts with the premium features."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive to use. It's helped me to budget and keep track of my money so much better. I would like the option be able to enter a purchase and pay out of multiple envelopes,but that is just a personal preference. The app is just as good (probably better) without it. EDIT: They added the split ti multiple envelopes feature :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic. The biggest drawback in keeping the budget balanced is me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best budgeting tool I've found after years of searching. Simple, accurate, and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and easy to manage."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far I like it. I hope I can stay on my budget. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple yet very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple interface, clean and easy. Importing of transduction could be made easier, especially remembering the Merchant's name and automatically assigning Envelope to it. It's pain to go through each transaction especially and selecting Envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Never had any issues with it, does exactly what we want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. Only some things that are annoying. Transactions should run month to month. Has delayed sync option."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Bit complicated but once you figure it out its good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been a great help in setting a monthly family budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good method, pretty good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent for keeping track of actual spend to budget by category. Helps me keep on track and have sufficient for each type of expense. Couldn't do without it now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've always struggled to manage my money and I've generally always spent everything in a day (I'm only a student working part time so not big money) but still... anyways, I now have money coming in and I can keep hold of it and track it. It's a brilliant app. As I'm a student, I've divided my spending saving and rent. I used to use separate bank accounts but it was getting ridiculous. It feels so much better knowing where you are up with your finances. Thank you goodbudget 😊"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic I am currently going through a divorce right now and I recently moved into my own place so I have to keep track of every last penny that I spend. Right after I buy something I put it in this planner and it works out really well. I'm able to keep track of every penny that I spend and I'm also able to save too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I try tons of budgeting apps and never seem to get a budget under control. The best part of this app is the positive feedback. It makes me want to keep going. Although I still haven't kept a good budget yet, I am getting closer than I ever have. Thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! But the date format when entering items has changed from: DAY-DD-MMM to a standard DD-MM-YYYY. Sounds minor but having that day (ie MON, TUE etc) prompt really helped when entering items retrospectively. Can you change it back pls?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best way to keep expenses in check even my kids use it and love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app was very confusing, it is not user friendly and then when you make a mistake, you can't go back and fix it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"In the help section it says I can change my budgeting period in settings, but I see no option in settings where I can do this, please help!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for helping my wife and me stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps track our spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy tracking, easy use, love that we can both use it and it updates instantly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app allows my husband and I to manage our account and do our budget with out having to use paper and pencil! I can put in a credit or debit on my phone and he can see it. Great app to go with those who are doing Financial Peace! We have been using this app for a while and love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App not working for me. Won't sync.  It's been confusing and frustrating.  I'm done."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It takes a while to get used to but its allll worth it. And part of the excitement anyway! Makes you want to stick to it. Envelope system works exaacttlyy (and better of course) as how I used to like to keep my expenses. Love the interphase n graphics too! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app available! I have used it for years with no problems!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really loved it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"ive tried many budget apps, this one by far is the easiest to use!! helps you keep track of where your money goes and helps you stay on a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I need it weekly their is onley monthly and yearly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app it keeps all of my account straight. It does so much more than help me stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best budgeting tool on Android period. Also available in the Apple store."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is very simple but has helped me a lot in managing my finance and keep me on budget. No super advanced skills are required."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Worth the wait!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Works great to track spending. Still stupidly difficult to change envelopes and add money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for more than two years now. It has proven to be extremely useful and reliable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and helps to track all the family's expenditures."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful and easy tool with automatic transactions and the ability to split transactions between envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works for my very simple budget. I don't need the premium version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Is as able to sync multiple family members spending to keep everyone in the know of the budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works great and perfectly fits my family's budgeting style (based on an envelope system) and supports our financial planning philosophy.  Very easy to use and understand.  Some improvement s could be made, but I see the developers continuously providing support and taking (and acting on) suggestions from users.  Great app, great developers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I hated the idea of withdrawing money and carrying so much cash with me or my husband not having the correct envelope when he went somewhere. This has the same concept but I can keep my bank accounts and not withdraw cash. It is really well implemented. I used only the free version for a while, but upgraded to the paid version a couple years ago. I recently tried other budgeting software/apps just to see what else was out there and came back in a hurry."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I both like it we can stay on the same page with our finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Had it in my previous phone so loved it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this for years, it is great to see the history and changes between high school and now. It helps keep my wife and I on track with our spending as we are now saving for a house"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally able to keep track of my finances. Nothing bad to say. Top notch. Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful but not super intuitive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does just what I need, helps me keep track of my spending. Makes you realize the wasteful spending one does."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great support."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps my husband and I in sync"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Growing up without a lot of money breeds some bad financial habits; this app is helping me get a grip on my stuff and manage several budgets at once. Great for anyone trying to make saving a habit"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like that you can use the envelopes to set different budgets for rent, bills etc and then transfer money you haven't spent from envelope to envelope. Never syncs though"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so awesome! It let's my husband & I know what our budget is & how we're doing. So easy to use! Makes my life so much easier!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I SERIOUSLY love my EEBA (Now GoodBudget)!! It has helped me be more attentive to the way I manage my finances and my overall budget!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to add in my receipts as I shop, lets me know how much I have left right then. I always had a hard time entering it on the computer when I got home. Then the receipts would pile up,and I would over spend each month. Thanks for the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried way too many budgeting and expense tracking apps (YNAB, Spendee, etc., etc.), Goodbudget stands out for its ease of use but you can also get pretty precise and in-depth on your finances if you wanted to, too. Best of all? They have the best support for any app I've ever bought here. To get the most out of it, you gotta buy into it but it is so worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best apps ever"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good one for you budget keeping"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My budgeting needs and wishes come true. At least most of it. I'm told the solutions to other needs are on the way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've tried a few different budget apps and this was the best for my needs. It would be ideal if there was a one time fee to purchase the app with more envelopes. I would like to see bar graphs for the reports to see trends for envelope spending over time (instead of pie charts for overall spending per envelope)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app ever"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful budgeting tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"But simple interfsce"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Pretty Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works well for our family. Makes it easy to log & track expenses in real time so both my wife and I know where we stand with the monthly budget all the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I've used this app for 4+ years. Overall, I love it! EXCEPT - The option to ""hide"" is not available via web or iPad. I understand the limit on envelopes, but I don't understand why I'm able to hide envelopes on my phone (droid), but not on my iPad or online. This makes editing transactions from older envelopes impossible, since you're only able to do that online & when you log in online you're prompted to delete envelopes to get down to the limit of 10. Requirements need to be the same across all platforms."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped us completely turn our finances around. Easy to use and intuitive. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It feels like I got a raise because my money doesn't disappear by itself. I track everything and I found I have more at the end of the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years. I found it after a Dave Ramsey class. I just couldn't do cash and actual envelopes. This has been a blessing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Forced to make a 5star comment...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep an eye on the budget. Easy to share same budget with the family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been able to track expenses and see where my money is going. Easy to use, easy to track trends, and keeps me on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy and useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This tool suites us well for managing our envelope-style budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am terrible when it comes to saving and spending. One day I look in my account and wonder where all the money went. So, I looked up some help and found this awesome app. Pretty much the old school envelope system, but mobile. You don't have to hook up any credit card numbers or personal information. Its hooked up on their website, just in case app crashes or phone is messed up!  You treat it like your bank and you'll know what you have in your account and what you can and can't touch. It's simple to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I keep a separate checkbook register, but use this to track my budget. I love the envelope method & the reports you have quick access to. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's taken me a while to find a budget that works for me, but I doubt I couldn't have done it without Goodbudget. I find Goodbudget simple enough to follow - more detailed budgeting solutions just make me feel frustrated!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Our budget is tight and this app helps me keep track of everything... I know how I'm doing and when I need to hold back... It gives me peace!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The free version fills all my needs and I love that it syncs with my wife's iphone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has helped me keep track of my spending by categories. Love the bar graph which tells you how you are doing within the month. And being mobile, you can log receipts as you spend. Plus, you can access from the computer. I use that for setting the year's budget. LOVE."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great graphical interface"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great. No crashing. Simple UI, very useful. Syncs with my wife on her iPhone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using it for years. Very convenient and helpful app indeed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Handy but expensive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple quick and makes budgeting easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use! My only complaint is that I wish I could keep track of monthly payments with my biweekly wages. It keeps thinking I'm low if I don't have the full amount when I put only half in the envelopes. But other than that, it works exactly like its supposed to!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool! Would recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's all I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I consistently use good budget and it has helped me track my finances and keep a good budget for some time now. I would get the paid version since I use it so much but it is just too expensive. I'm sorry but I'm not budgeting my budget ap. I've learned to use the limited envelopes with the free version. It's fairly simple to use and gets easier the more you use it. The only thing I really wish it had was a way to reconcile"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app. Classic budgeting, simple, yet flexible. Could not keep a budget wout it. Too much work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent and helps me stay on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best way to keep track of budget without using envelopes.  Been using it for several years with great success."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I  was looking for in a budget tracker:  custom start date, split transactions, spent & balance on each category.  Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have been using this app for over a year now to help keep our budget on track. It works great for us :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps myself and my wife keep on track with smaller items of our budget such as gas budget.  Changing and adding funds to categories could use a little refinement as she's never been able to figure it out"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It just gets better"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Quick way to create, organize and manage a budget.  I really like the flexibility to split a purchase into multiple envelopes and the built in calculator that allows me to total individual items without leaving that record."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's very good, but I wish it were a little more customizable - - maybe being able to manually set your own budget time line, as in how often it refreshes (30 days vs weeks etc)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The reports tab they added is really neat"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep spending in control"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app I've ever used. Real simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this religiously. We would be lost in a hole of over spending if we didn't use this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The function I liken the most is that my wife and I can see and map out our spending whiteout constantly discussing. What we spent is very clear before our eyes once we turn it on."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Some things are confusing. Helps overall though for our household."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has revolutionized our budgeting! So easy and so simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has a few quirks (things that are more easily set up on a computer) but it has saved us a ton of money this year.  Great tool and I have recommended it to everyone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app, really usefull"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Uninstalled after a few days."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Live using this app! So easy to budget and keep track of where you are."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This is my third try with this app. It crashed several times before I finished doing the initial setup, and I still can't figure out how to set an initial balance for my account (or to edit the account in any way, for that matter). Edit: apparently you have to do that on the web or an iPhone; so android app seems pretty limited. The idea seems to be really good, which made me keep trying to get it working, but it just didn't work out for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great envelope based budgeting app. Syncs online and across multiple devices. My wife and I can always check our spending to make sure we're on-budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Stopped using quicken. Enough said"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would like ability to mark expenses as cleared vs not cleared to check with my bank statements."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"have to do a trasaction twice to so it transfered from savings to checking or cash. income has to come from its own envelope"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Very difficult and could not understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"... An electronic envelop system.  It is not an end all, be all budgeting tool, but a great supplement in our budgeting toolbox.  We use for discretionary expenses like eating out, groceries (above and beyond the basis) entertainment, clothing, personal care items, etc. as a way to communicate available funds in the family budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It just keeps getting better and better. Love how they added transaction button in lower right corner."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can't praise this app enough. By all means, I still spend a little too much on clothing, but now it's TRACKED. I love being able to keep everything organized♡♡"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just don't really understand everything yet!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like how easy it is to use. Still getting my head around filling the envelopes but so far I'm loving this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful app.  Helps keep us on budget.  Would give five stars if you could upload csv files."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great simple app that doesn't force you to put credit card information"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Actually works!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Went on a cash budget to pay off some credit card debt.  This is great.  Easy to track all expenditures and stay on target."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There a few things that are missing that the web app has. One of those things being able to transfer funds between envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Is there any way I can delete all the transactions and start freshly again?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great! Synced with my girlfriends phone its awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I couldn't find the feature in which i could replenish my salary and envelopes for the month. When i did try it just added it to my last months envelopes. I needed it to start from scratch.  I used the app for 1 month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great to keep track with daily expenses. Really like the graph as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easier to manage n use. Keep it up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, just works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It works great and it was just what I needed to get my finances organized."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app if you like a lightweight but flexible budget tracker.  Whole thing is web-based, so it's great for what I need it for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps organize finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"i like this app but it is not best..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've used this for awhile and found it helps keep us on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app is very useful but needs some improvements and to be more clear"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use, nice interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I couldn't check my previous month spending report. Someone please enlighten me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Easy to understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I LOVE this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use and we'll developed. Love the sync options between phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I use to manage tha cash coming in via my wife home business. Easy and really helpful. I was thinking to go pro, but it is expensive. I would prefere a one-of fee or a lower monthly fee."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budget tracker"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a butey :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Bit too simple?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Completely transformed the way we look at our spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I wish this had option for a food stamp card. Being a single parent I have to keep a close eye on my food card. And this doesn't give me an option for that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I are really enjoying using this App. It has helped to alleviate much financial stress between us and enabled us to keep better track of where our money is going. We only fill the envelopes from a paycheck that has cleared and spend and save only from that. Any funds in our account prior to starting with Goodbudget have become padding! We are using information we learned from Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and from YNAB as well as some finance tips we've picked up from various blogs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It lets me keep virtual envelopes so I don't have to carry around cash. It's very flexible with different pay cycles and I have never had any problems syncing with the website. I have been using this app for over a year and will continue to use it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Greatest app out there for keeping you on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With this app I managed to get our family ahead a whole month, in just a month! No more paycheck to paycheck! I do wish you could link your bank account though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"A few days in and I was trying to change my initial fill to the correct amount (so it stopped claiming I has unaccounted money when I didnt). Very clunky user interface which didn't let me change things easily. Don't believe I did anything drastic but suddenly all my envelopes got deleted. The payments are still logged but they appear as ""user deleted envelope"". Incredibly frustrating!! Really don't want to have to go back and manually log every single entry again..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful and reliable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"That works well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Everyone needs this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Has been a good tool to keep me on track of my savings goal and help make me stop and think before I spend any money. Takes some learning as you go. Like don't start on the first of the month, but start with the first paycheck of the month and end the day before your first paycheck of the following month. Maybe the website has a tutorial? Or maybe some hints?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"why need my location to use budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works well. I did paper envelopes in the past, but this app makes it easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"App is decent, some things I like include: clean interface, cloud based so I can see online, family based so wife and I can both update. Room for improvement though: 1)can't manage recurring transactions from the app, only online. 2) no way to ""add another"" when you're adding a transaction-- you add one, return to the list view, then click add again, annoying. 3) when ""filling envelopes"" you can't auto fill them to a preset amount, it's a pain. I use this as a checkbook, but it works for that, so I like."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"From crawling myself at the end of the month because I spent all of it, to finding myself with a surplus, this is a must have for anyone willing to save."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's basic. I would pay for the program, but it's a monthly fee. Worth $10, but they want that much every 2 months. Ridiculous. Also, the rating is probably artificially elevated by constant prompts to rate it at 5 stars. A few small tweaks to the problems mentioned would make this a worthwhile app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app helps me every single day. I absolutely love it. The only reason I give it 4/5 is it can be a tad clunky with certain features but overall easy to use and budget. I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good straightforward budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been tremendously helpful to me and my family. We've now got a far, far better grasp on how much we can spend and where it's all going. We've begun to save and feel secure thanks to this app and personal discipline!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The app is great, but it won't sync and I got a new phone and can't transfer my data to my new phone. Very annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Worth trying!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My hubby and I can both  keep track and update our budget on our separate phones and it syncs. LOVE IT. My only complaint is that when i need to choose multiple envelopes on my phone, it only goes up to 2. I can do more than 2 online and it would be nice to choose more than 2 on my phone too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"what does my location habe to do with a budget? Carpy App shuts off unless I allow my location access over the Internet. The sun don't shine in certain places and that's where this belongs 😆"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"In order for anything to work, you have to make a practice of using it. The envelopes are so easy and I share it with my husband so we can both enter our expenses as we create them. I've tried many things on the computer online and on my phone and this is the one that we use the most"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Any chance you can add a widget to show balance of a selected envelope?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Feature rich but still simple enough to use with no major learning curve. Keeps synched between me and my wife. She loves she doesn't have to call and see if we have the money for some this month because her phone always can show her."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that this is presented as an envelope system. Takes a little getting used to, but also love that it's an app and online. Has saved my finances!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I installed the app in hopes that I could keep track of my budget. It uses ""encelopes"" to keep track of your funds. Who has ever heard of this type of budgeting? And on top of that I get unsolicited emails from their company on top of it all. If you are looking for a better way to budget, stay away from this app. It's nothing but a glorified version of someone's mother's budgeting system. I found the app very confusing and not very easy to share. And on top of it I get emails from their company. Don't use!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Difficult to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works pretty well, it's simple, does what it needs to. Great budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple but useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Difficult to figure out. But incredibly useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been looking for this type of app to monitor spending between me and my husband, so glad i found this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I have been using it for years and it has helped me to stop living paycheck to paycheck."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelopes are the ultimate budgeting tool and Goodbudget does it so well. Both my wife and I can see the budget in real-time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this for our monthly budgeting. It sync's to both of our phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helps!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for a simple budget that is easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for a free app. Takes a little getting use to, but definitely helps keep me on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This makes the envelope system so easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect solution for us. We wanted to do the envelope system of budgeting, but we're so used to using our debit card and I wasn't comfortable carrying a lot of cash around. This app allows us to continue with cashless transactions, yet keep careful track of everything and stay organized. What a blessing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Precisely what I need in an envelope budgeting app. Sleek, useful, with enough features, but doesn't feel bogged down or confusing. I also love that it syncs with the website account, so I can budget anywhere!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I am using it and it has made me much more aware of my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I suppose you have to be familiar with the envelope system to use this. I was looking for more of a ledger system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really useful and simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, just gets better and better"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app for budgeting on the go, helps keep track of spending habits and makes me feel good when I save money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful free app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the app, it helps me with everyday budgeting. Also, love the personality that comes along with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The main reason why I'm trying to budget is because I have a limited income, and get paid bi-weekly. Would be really useful to budget weekly and monthly. I realize I can just calculate it all into monthly but I rather just have an app that can do weekly budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The problem is getting used to it, and the lack of features as compared to what you can do with the web version. But I have started saving again thanks to this app. Wish you can make the interface easier to use and more flexible, but other than that, a fabulous app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a while to track my spending. The latest redesign is awesome and much more appealing than the darker interface. Good work!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great tool to stay out of debt and build wealth!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and figure out. You can enter data from the website or from the tablet or phone  recommend this to every one!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"i wish it were possible to track income in the same way, for people who don't have consistent income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!!  I can keep up with my budget even while I'm away from the computer. Makes it super easy to see how much I have left and where money is going. Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like visual. Aids! This will change my spending habits. I actually deleted the app a long time ago cuz I really didn't understand it. But I  have it set up again and think it will work this time. At least I  understand it now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like this app but I would like it to have  weekly income budget period aside from  monthly ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Would benefit from a ""how to use this app"" intro."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sometimes it's hard to understand how it works, but I like that it's linked to a website"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you're having problems keeping a lid on your spending, this app is amazing. A bit of a learning curve, but If you can read and follow directions, it's not a problem. Thanks developers, and God bless."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very easy to use and easy to keep up on a budget. I've tried sticking to a budget before, but thanks to Goodbudget this is the first time I've been able to keep up on it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just started using it this week. So far so good. The free version 10 envelope limit is pretty limiting. App will not let you add transaction from unallocated. Also some things are awkward. For example I filled my envelopes before rearranging them, and had to delete everything and start over, instead of the app automatically redistributing the money. Overall a great app for being free, and no ads. ☺"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a few years now. It's simple, but it works, which is exactly what I wanted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I truly want to love this app, but simple concepts are made difficult. I.e., add to budget/set budget/ set specific budget -ugh!   Sometimes you just want a budget to start fresh each month.  This app is extremely advanced and requires you to read community support for for the basics, sheesh.  I paid for it so will continue to use it, but the app needs more hints on the app so its user friendly.  I mean, you shouldn't have to go to the web to figure out how to reset your acct..  So frustrating at times"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was reading about mint and other good tools with web and smartphone app, but in Europe you cannot sign up, no chance to try. GoodBudget has a usable free plan, nice reports, logical and fast UI"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love it but I need more than 10 monthly envelopes with means paying $4 to $5 a month depending if you pay monthly or yearly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"most salaries paid fortnightly hence would be a lot better the budget cycle is “paid fortnightly” and with a “pay start date ” so that the budget period can be align with each persons pay date. With the expenses we have some expenses paid weekly , some paid fortnightly and some paid yearly would be good if we can enter the lumsum amt (”1000”) and choose payment frequency (“yrly”) and the app can calculate avg weekly, monthly , fortnightly and monthly exp, depending on the frequency we want to view."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Found this app a few months into my marriage after we overspent on the honeymoon. Goodbudget is a life saver!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like this I have been keep track on my budget lately but this is better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really love the computer based version of goodbudget and it's accessibility. I rarely use the phone app but i enjoy the ability to check my standings on the go if i need to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Getting finances in order... Having the app lets me budget on the go~"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It either automatically added my paychecks into the envelopes, or it said they were empty. I thought this was an app that would set a budget for each category, then let me add transactions to each one and then show me how much left I could spend on ""Groceries"" etc. This app is very confusing and I don't like how its set up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Such a great tool; I've never been better at tracking my spending and staying within my budget than with this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wish it was a little more user friendly, but so far it's keeping me accountable!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like this application. .it has helped me a lot..at any time  I can track down my expenses. ..it is very user friendly. .."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It simply works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. The update has stats which are great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app I've ever used. It has helped my wife and I stay on track as we can sync up to three devices with the free subscription."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I didn't know what I was missing until I got this app.  It's worth the 45$ just to be able to synchronize the whole families spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Our budget has been so much easier to handle since having this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Graphs depicting income vs spending were a long time coming... Good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and beautiful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm terrible at keeping up with a budget, but having this on my phone makes it easy to keep track of my spending. Not too fond of the new format. I preferred to have the new transaction button at the top instead of over the envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great tool to get a handle where the money is going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm someone who likes a lot of user control over an app. It's a lot of information input the way I do it, but it gives the most information for my spending habits regardless of whether I use cash or card. I also have my student loans in here, and it's always telling me I'm in the red. But it's helped me and my wife be able to see what our budget actually is and now we're saving money when we were running a loss every month before that and didn't really know it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There are some weird quirks that make this hard to customize, but overall it's a great little app that has helped us slowly crawl out of debt. Yea, Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Functionality suffers from another poor Google material design update. I click ""fill envelopes"" and select ""fill each envelope"" and all my envelopes are 0.00$. So, I try again and again. Now my bank account shows some 6k and my envelopes are still 0."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"After using this App for several years I've finally decided to subscribe to the plus service. The developers have. made some real improvements during that time and it does the job really well. I'd like to see the option of 6 monthly targets in the future!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A well designed app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does the job of keeping your budget in order in an easy to understand way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to use. I tried a few other apps but this one is the best.  Got the upgrade so I could get unlimited envelopes but worth it. They were great with all my questions, responded quickly to them."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has made budgeting between multiple devices so simple. My husband and I both use it and love it. Thanks so much"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app works very well,  the $5 per month subscription is well worth it for the unlimited envelopes feature. It's the envelope system for the avid app user."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is my first budget tool. I don't think I will switch.  Works great for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without this app now brilliant for keeping an eye on your spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This was a good app until I decided to reconcile.  Apparently it doesnèt know how to add and subtract.  Even after finding variance and making the adjustment, it still did not show the right bank balance.  Not sure what I will do now other than be very disapppointed that I finally found an app that was suppose to help me accomplish the envelope system the way that it promised.  I have spent more that 8 hours on this app between set -up and reconciliation, and I only used it for 3 weeks.  By the way, I have an Accountant background and was once a QuickBooks Advisor and trainer, so I know what I am doing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My budgeting has always taken aturn for the complicated, but this app is helping me stay on track very simply.  It's easy to just check in and type it up at the end of the day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Of all of the different budgeting apps I've tried, this one is far superior."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is wonderful, and works great for transitioning from a cash envelope system to something easier to maintain. The biggest downside is that you get only 10 envelopes for free, which is not quite enough for us. The paid version didn't seem to offer much except more envelopes, and is an expensive subscription model rather than a one-time purchase. They should add a paid option that is a one time payment to access a few more envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use this app everyday for the past couple years."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping organized so easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it's supposed to do, doesn't try to do anything else, and does its job exceptionally well. Very solid piece of software."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great and helps more than you'll ever know"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Well designed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"THIS APP IS AMAZING"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Only way to keep my husband on track.  Hasn't gone in  over draft since we started using it ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app is very user-unfriendly. It's extremely difficult and confusing to use. Even for me, and I grew up in the generation that grew up with technology! If anyone should understand how to use it, it's me... I suggest a complete overhaul of the app design because it's absolutely horrible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What a boon. Wife and I run the app on the phones and I master it from the website. Works perfectly. Great concept brilliantly executed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a good app to help keep track if where your money goes, and plan some future expenses. With the latest updates even some statistics are now available in the app. Very satisfied overall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really good budgeting app complimenting the Web interface, easily track expenses, do budgeting and see expense reports across accounts. Would love to be able to see pending expenses on mobile app with notification."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a year and it works well, it's easy to edit, and it is simple enough that I spend more time tracking my money than figuring out how to use an app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not what im looking for. Wouldnt let me budget by the week."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it promises, and is my go to budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Managing my money better than anyone I know"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super effective in keeping budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"First it did not sync at all. Then I did as the website suggest. Next it synced but not correctly. Said I had zero in my envelopes even though I filled them. The website also is very confusing and not user friendly. I'm not anywhere close to a new computer user so if it's not easy for me to comprehend, I am not sure many will be able to. Family budgets should be easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Help us keep on track with our budget. Very flexible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to use with your spouse!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really well designed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used the Goodbudget website to set up my budget and I use my phone to enter my transactions. The app has several envelops/categories so I can keep track of everything in once place. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Your app is fantastic. Now I can see when and what I have spent on specifically everything.  There are two suggestions for you, hope you like it. 1, please put an option of money at bank and money in hand. So that we would be aware what we have in hand and what is saved in bank. It will also be easy to reconcile everything.  2, your premium features are costly. Please decrease the amount so that a large number of customers influenced to buy these features. You must have very less paid customers. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant for keeping on top of family expenses, staying on budget and living within our means. Only app I've ever found useful enough to upgrade from free to paid."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Product! Worth Every Penny!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Maybe this latest update fixed it, but it used to not record some of the changes I made. This would mess up my budget, but it can get fixed each time with some effort."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've tried almost all the budgeting apps and this is one of the best. I use the app daily to track my finances and could not live without out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"More manual than others in the market, but also more flexible"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way for my family to track the budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The interface is simple and clear, and as a beginner at budgeting I found that I quickly got a handle how to organise my income and spend more responsibly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Don't know what I'd do without it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was a little bit of a learning curve since I was new to budgeting, but I love it. I love the new in app reports."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"New version... No difference for me... Still like this app and still recommend it. Simple and effective. If you commit to use it you'll see results. Split your budget for different projects and needs (spending or savings according to the envelopes you create) get a routine to put your info and see where the money really goes.  Get it and explore. Why still 4 stars and not five... There's a possible bug that doesn't let the alerts work with certain calendar apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great!  I have used it for years.  First it help me understand where my money was going.  Then I used it to get out of debt.   $6,000 in credit card debt gone in 9 months.  Now I'm using it to focus on savings goals like emergencies,  vacations,  tuition, and even retirement.  I used to use all 10 envelopes for different bills and expenses.  Now I have made it my own using the 50/20/30 budgeting system.  The reports are very helpful and are an easy way to understand your spending on large scales"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping track as convenient as possible!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Money tracking made easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for over a year to keep my expenses in check and I have no complains at all."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not a 5 star because I'd pay $100 for lifetime subscription if available!! Such a brilliant and beautiful app!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works fantastically for me any my wife"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. If you are a Dave Ramesy user and want to use debit card instead of cash this is the app... This app makes it easy for couples"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We love this app. We were using a paper envelope/cash system but it was problematic and this is brilliant. Allow me to set budgets to 4-weekly (shows monthly so I can't tell how far ahead/behind I am) and it'd be 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need to keep me in line with my discretionary spending each month! Easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Have been using this app for years. Simple and gets the job done. The UI is a little dated though..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for a while now, and it's a very useful tool for home budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Always helps me keep track. Never had any issues."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The categories are very customizable. The app lets you know when you are off budget.  Easy to review and search transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app itself won't save your money, you have to use it as a tool and it's a very useful tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does what it says... Just wish there were more envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting app!  Helps our family stay on track.   Please remove the blue ""add button "" at the bottom.   It's distracting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'll give it a try for a month or two. Will report back my review"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget is a great app. My wife and I both have it on our phones. When I update our budget we can both see in real time the balance in each envelope. When she is out shopping she can look at Goodbudget to decide what she can spend in each category. Couldn't be more pleased with Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, just what we were looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Visually simple, practically effective!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its great for seeing where my spending is going and reminding me of the bills I have to spend my money on so that I leave that money in the bank."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to import transactions from your bank and match existing transactions. This helps me make sure I don't miss anything. Thanks for the great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't know what I ever did without this. If you're working from a budget, you NEED this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just wish I wasn't a shopaholic... but at least I know where it's all going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good one!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I love the concept, the interface, and the graphics. I finally have a budget that works and an app that I love to use that helps me to stick to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent for managing my expenses with instant online synch!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very very helpful. works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app is great and really helped us budget better.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because in order to get more than 10 envelopes and use it on more than 2 devices, you have to pay like $5 a month....  $60 a year is a little much for something you could do on paper, esp when you are budgeting to save money.  But for free I can't complain."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me and my family on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using good budget for about 6 months now. We can't live without. The instant shared drive is amazing. Best budgeting system I have ever tried and see no reason to try any other budgeting program again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It works. I keep up with it. Got my own system for it. Keep up the good work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use and is an excellent tool to track your household income and expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"...And love it. Fantastic app for budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this daily. It's easily organized, simple to use, and an excellent way to keep track. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use the website as well and it's lovely to find an app that doesn't feel like a downgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"One of my most useful apps. It really helps our family stay on budget. Love that it syncs between droids, iPhones and computers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What a life saver! My husband and I tried using a cash envelope system but with being on opposite work schedules it didn't work out. We never saw each other to get the cash when we needed it. Now we use these electronic envelopes and it works wonderfully for our situation."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up and entering transactions transactions take mere seconds. Great little app, makes tracking every cent of your budget a chore of less than 30 seconds a day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful app that is really easy to use, encode expenses on the fly and provide great factual data that Rosalyn and I use to discuss money matters. It's a big help to our couple!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is the best budgeting app there is I'm currently living on 33% of my income and saving the rest."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, I have been using it for a year and it has really helped me get myself organized.  Really simple to use but has everything you need to start budgeting. I would suggest to anyone trying to put a budget together. Love new report section!                                                                                                        -The only thing that would make this app better would be if the Goodbudget Plus with unlimited envelopes was a one time fee you pay, not monthly or yearly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed to keep myself in track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sinse I use this application, I can control my expense. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If you're looking for a way to keep up with finances in the modern world there isn't a better app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couldn't live without it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love to use this app for all my budgeting needs. It's easy to use and if I switch phones I don't have to worry about losing any of the data I have saved on it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helps my husband and me stay on the same page with our separate accounts. Not so great at utilizing the envelopes to the fullest, but we're learning. We have had no overdrafts since using Goodbudget! Yipee!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great to coordinate spending with spouse."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if there's a way to save backups, not just sync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely easy to use and helps my wife and I stay on the same page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good for simple household budgeting. Would recommend to anyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use. I've only had it for a fortnight and it's really focusing my mind on budgeting for the first time ever! I lumped all my bills together in one envelope as I pay them by direct debit, so I have bills, groceries, petrol, credit card payments, savings, my stuff, my husband's stuff, kids' stuff and miscellaneous. No need to pay for the upgrade, or not yet!                        Update: have now been using the app for 3 months and I still love it. Syncing with my husband's device is brilliant"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track for the month. Love the sliding scales."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This really helps my wife and I to stay on track to budget and save money every month. Excellent budget tool. I love that it syncs between our two phones"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Budget App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great App!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't use this to do a budget, track my bills or my income. But this app is GREAT for managing all of my spending and savings categories in the budget I already have so I always know how much money I have left to spend, or how far along I am towards a saving goal. Doesn't need to connect to a bank so I get to just tell it how much money I have for each item and load each transaction. Works just like the old envelope system but don't have to hassle with withdrawing money, and keeping it on you at all times"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps my family tremendously with budgeting our income!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm actually saving money, which has always been a problem for me!The mental image of the envelopes is just what my numerically-challenged brain can handle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Trying to balance all the family's accounts in two countries/currencies gets confusing at the best of times. This app has helped so much with understanding my current position. Particularly like the credit card account as i no longer have to think about putting aside money each month as it's done automatically through use of the envelopes. Plus new app ui brings it a much needed update."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me to stay within a budget with very little administration  for the first time in my life! Given me so much of peace of mind to have my finances sorted and keep me from overspending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely helping keep track of things"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for using the envelope System without carrying cash around everywhere."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sharing a budget is made easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It fits how I like to budget.  One of the very few apps I pay for and it's worth every penny. I even have an envelope for my annual Good budget fee!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for tracking where you are in your budget cycle. Love the sync ability too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use! It's been a boon to my financial situation.  No more wondering if I can afford something.  Just have to check my envelope, decision made."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love Good Budget for our budgeting. It has really helped us a lot to stay on budget, be accountable and set goals. I'm so glad I found it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that it allows for sharing so my wife and I can both track expenditures from our phones. Has made budgeting and holding ourselves accountable easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. I've always been useless at budgeting but now for the first time feel in control thanks to this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You still really have to train yourself to put any spending in manually, and it takes quite a bit of initial setup, but this app won't hold you back with forced features or trying to do things for you and doing it wrong. Basically a better checkbook because it does the math for you and let's you keep track of sections. Been using it for a year now and it's exactly what I was looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This app needs some improvement. It needs to auto fill transaction information based on GPS locations like YNAB does. I also wish they had a desktop version like YNAB. Paying $45 a year is just too much for someone like me. I'd rather pay $60 all at once with no recurring payments. Would be nicer to keep my finances personal like YNAB and be able to store unlimited years of history instead of storing data on the good budget server. Last but not least it needs better ways to deal with credit card accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You don't have to sync with your account. You can keep track of exactly what you're spending on. I recommend it to everyone. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is helping manage my money better.. Keeping track what I spend"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Really helps me stay on top of budgeting. Took a little while to get used to... A lot of trial and error, but once you're there its pretty straightforward"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'd be lost without this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We use this app for almost a year and we have been managing to see how our account is running at any given time..we owe big gratitude to the creators of this app!! Still needs few add ons like adding end date to scheduled expences for example.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love being able to track things on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can't tell you how much I love this app.  My wife and I can both keep track of our spending. A quick glance tells us if we have enough money to take the kids to a movie, buy a pair of shoes, or go on a vacation. If an envelope is low, we just have to wait for another paycheck to come in.  It's a budget conscious families best friend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Probably the best way to set up your future goals and how you want to pay your debt. It gives you a clear idea what you must do to live within your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app really helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried about 10 of the budget apps on the Google Play store and this one was the best.  It syncs effortlessly with my wife's phone and allows us to keep our finances on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app...I recommend it to everyone :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works as advertised, and then some."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for over 2 years and it has been extremely helpful. I'm not a fan of the most recent Android update, but even with that, there's not a better budget app out there in my opinion."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GUI updates are great!  Wife and I can share one budget that is always up to date. Easy to manage and to plan!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Hope you increase the number of envelops in free version..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for at least 2 years and it hasn't failed me yet!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and effective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget is a great app!!!! It really does help me manage my money so much better! Thanks guys for this great app!!! The material update is great as well!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Until now, I have not been able to find an internet budgeting solution based on the old envelopes budgeting method that is able to give real-time information.  Or is easy to see and track spending.  What makes this really work is how easy it is to reconcile bank and credit card accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app daily and it has totally helped me see my spending habits and even save some money.  Highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for over 3 years and it has absolutely changed the finances of my family forever!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It will be nice if I can categorized my spending habits"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app we use it everyday and it has helped us be accountable for where our money is going and save money!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"These guys have clearly had to budget their money before - it's like they got inside my and my husband's heads when they made this app. Easy, intuitive and thorough. Love it! (Update: not a huge fan of the floating '+' button, it's in a weird spot. Prefer to have the option of having it at the top...)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I are in love with this app! The sync feature is everything! It's really been a huge game changer for us in trying to stick to a budget and pay off debts! Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budget is easy to use and works well. My wife and I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Family has been using this app for 3 months works great... best free app out there. Better if you do the one year plan"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Name should be changed to Greatbudget. Awesome Budgeting app. Now comes with reports. Just love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I would be happy to pay more for unlimited envelopes if I could use Google play credit. Otherwise great app. Love the new look too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped my family out immensely!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App, but I hate the blue button over the envelopes, from the update. Before the update it was a plus in the control bar at the top of the screen. It was much better before the update. Now the control bar is too big also."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and really helping me to control my monthly budget and increase my savings unconsciously. Already use it for almost 4 years and this app never disappoint me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not worth the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome update!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the helpful reply. I hadn't thought of sweeping the remainder into a separate envelope. I'm happy to see a new Reports tab today too (Version 2.4.2). Keep up the wonderful work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using this app to keep our budget for over 5 years now. We love how we're able to see whether we're ahead or behind during a month--it helps us to spend consciously. Love the new in-app reports. We've always used the web-based reports, but these are handy to have on the go!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting app period. Great job guys!! Material design is excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Who would pay 45 a year on a subscription to add extra monthly expenses make it a one time dollar ammount say you charged 2 dollars maybe 1 percent of users yould pay the subscription but more than 40 percent would pay the 2 dollars with  a million subscribers that's 400,000$ not bad for a simple software make it paid all togelther now that you have your name out do a little advertising"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Could be a little more intuitive but all and all good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use once you get past the initial learning curve (which takes around 5-10 minutes). Pros: The only true budgeting app that allows full control of cash flow, mascot is an eye candy. Cons: Unable to view total amount spent in the phone app (only available in web view), unable to set sub-categories in envelopes, no multiple currency support, widget shows account balance (!!!) on the homescreen, only 1 account available for free version. Suggestion: Option should be included to view ads to ""unlock"" a few more accounts - still less than full subscription to encourage people who need more to pay for it. 4* for the free version, which is good for college students with a small budget. I won't bother for the paid version because you can get apps with more functionality at that price point."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love tracking were my money is actually going! Was an eye opener, who knew eating out was such a big expense.  App is really helping me to get things under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps track daily weekly monthly and yearly expenses very well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get the hang of it it is very easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have separate accounts. It use to take us hours to figure out our budget. Then I would wonder if he spent too much fun money. He would wonder if I spent too much fun money. Despite having a 'budget'..... there was a lot of confusion. With Goodbudget, we are on the same page. We can both look in one place and know how much is left in each envelope. It makes life simpler. We paid for the full version. Even budgeted for next years because I can't imagine going back to the old way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Need update to make savings envelope easier to deposit in.  Otherwise, a great app for basic budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With a little work, you can have a real time budget allowing you to plan, save and spend with confidence.  Account for every penny you ever earn!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the most intuitive and simple budgeting app! It takes me just a few seconds to enter the transaction even while I'm waiting for my credit/debit card to be charged at the store. I've been using it daily since 2012 and would highly recommend it to both single and married people!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great and gives the user lots of control"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I'm sarching for to get my budget up to date."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"May need Internet fot some functions. Overall good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the easy App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that my husband and I can see the envelope balances at a glance. And it tells us how many days to stop spending in a category if we've overspent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Live the options how to fill folders. Keeps me on track through the month!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a couple of years now and can't imagine functioning w/o it. Having all my accounts in  one place makes it extremely easy to see how much money I have with one click."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps us keep ourselves on budget. Highly recommend this easy to use app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couple little issues here and there, but it's probably my own fault for not reading the  tutorials. Absolutely great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love that my husband and I can use it together and see what we've both spent etc"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's OK not much to do on it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A well made app for recording transactions on the go and checking your budget before spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps me to be accountable for every purchase I make, and in turn build up my savings. Easy to use, with a good Help section if you do get stuck."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too complex to figure out and was a waste of time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Recently got married and this app has helped my husband and I get our finances in order now that they are all in one place! Definitely recommend!! Very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just had first successful budget month thanks to this!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Will not sync our apps. Logged into same account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"First time using an end envelope system.  Wish I'd started sooner! The app is amazingly easy to use of certain you git to grips with it..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I simply use this app to track my day to day spending as it was getting out of control. It's the best free app I found for my needs. I can see that if I had a family, I might want to buy the full version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice free app. I wanted to try the envelope system, but don't really want to deal with cash nor envelope, so envelopes on an app is def the solution I need. Very Recommended !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It raped my mind"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the only app that I use now. Hard to get around at first, but the best once you get to know how to add in envelopes. Nice concept."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wish there was an export function but otherwise it's really useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Why it needs location?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wish you didn't have to pay for unlimited envelopes, but really it's nothing compared to the money you probably save using this thing. I love that you can add income later and distribute it between envelopes however you please. Good stuff!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Every time I try to make a change to one of my accounts if crashes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent envelope system that allows me and my wife to have immediate access to every envelope, even when we're miles apart. We love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for months now, and I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Waste of time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've only been using this app four weeks and just being able to see how much money we spend on unnecessary stuff has started growing quite a savings already."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to tap in your receipt or spend and keep on track. Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We log every purchase and it has really helped is stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a great free app that really helps you manage your money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Configurable, does pocket budgets just the way I need it to. Good transaction interface. Easy to-use interface over all. Nice  online tools/sync. I wish the Android app let you reconcile, but at least the online interface does."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app dies what us says and works great across devices. My only complaint is that its not easy to figure out the top-up methods."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wanted to see where my money goes every month because I was spending unconsciously. This helped me to become more economic."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect system for keeping track of your money and forcing yourself to think about where each dollar goes. Cloud-based so everything is synced across all devices. Very nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"But what a fantastic ap otherwise"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only lets me input 10 monthly  envelopes, I have way more then 10. Didnt work out for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easiest way to keep track of your spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is the most useful budgetting app I could find. Now if only I can have some analysis with it..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like how we can just use it without going crazy with bank accounts and stuff."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app is great once you get the ins and outs learned. Hard to figure at first and still learning but once I got the basics down I was off and running. Saved $500 in the first month just being able to split up my funds so it didn't seem like I had one big number to look at forgetting all the little things that cash needed to go towards. Great app!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my needs!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Needs to be more user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly and easy way to keep on top of my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"data entry is easy.  But reporting is quite limiting.  I need to do a lot of work every month in excel to get a good summary view."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was never able to stick to a budget before GoodBudget. I love that the app syncs with both phones and my computer ... and it's FREE! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been a long time good budget user, but I used to keep an Excel spreadsheet for the monthly stuff, and use the app for the more frequent transactions. I finally decided to take a leap of faith and upgrade to premium and now I can use good budget for all my categories, accounts, debts, and it's so easy to use by simply importing my transactions from my bank."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app is vary basic, bare bones.  Not a lot of flash, bells or whistles, but it gets the job done.  With the free version, it's fairly easy to manage a single person's lifestyle and expenses.  If one were managing a small business or a family, I personally do not think this free app would cut it, nor would I recommend paying for the unlimited accounts.  There is much better software out there like YNAB or mint to name a few."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keeps me on track. I like it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The app will not let me complete the setup for a household. It will not accept my email and refuses to let me exit that screen of the setup. I am also unable to exit the app, I have to restart my phone to get out of it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Adding income and separating it into separate envelopes... just too complicated. I just wanted something to track what I spend. This is NOT that app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's fantastic. I love that it links two phones so my husband and I can keep track together. Makes you watch where your money goes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It definitely brings awareness to where you're spending your money even if you don't need to be on a budget! The result, you do end up spending money more wisely!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what i needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall it works great. It took some playing around with to figure out all the features, like how to split a purchase between many envelopes, as it wasn't always intuitive. My wife and I are much more organized with this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good for coordinating with my wife. We have our own ""fun money"" envelopes so we can buy stuff for ourselves"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its great app. It has so far helped me quite a bit with budgeting. (corrected) I just wish it had a option for the envlopes it would let you set them to every 2 weeks but I can work around it by making bigger calculations"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it becuse its simple without having to add your bank account information or credit card to me people that do that are lazy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelop system is the best way for me personally to keep track of what I'm spending and what my budget is. Good Budget is a great way to do this without having to keep cash, and they do all the number crunching for you! Plus it's easy to review transactions if your bank account and good budget don't match up. It takes some time to learn how to use it but that's the same for any app. Great job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I just installed this app 20 minutes ago and it already has me growling!! I love its concept which is what earned it the two stars it's getting from me but beyond that it is ridiculous... I can't switch between this app and any other app on my tablet to be able to get details to enter, so I would have to write down all the info I need from other sources to enter them into this app so it won't crash, which TOTALLY defeats the purpose of a digital system. No thanks. I'll try a different app instead."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I would love to see envelopes with a percentage of my income in setup mode. If I could also choose a percentage when funding my envelopes that would be cool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The envelope method doesn't work for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"it helps a lot..love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It was basic"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, it helps to keep track and control your expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It helps me stay on track. It's fantastic!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use good budget for the main risky categories.  I wanted to see where our problem areas were,  so I set up 5 envelopes to start.  Its been helpful to learn that we were spending too much money on household items and that we were right on track with groceries. It would be nice to have the ability to work on 4 devices., but the functionality has been great so far"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is great tool!! It makes it so easy to keep track of purchases and stay on budget! It syncs with multiple phones. Very useful tool for the Dave Ramsey plan!  My gripe with it after using it for a couple years now is that the phone app RARELY let's me split a total on more then 2 envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very handy app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Pleasing and professional design."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I have never been good with money and never really knew how or where to begin to learn the concept of budgeting my money. This app was perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is simple and easy to use, I love it. However, you only get 10 free envelopes, I need maybe another five. But it costs $5 a month to get more! Obviously, I'm learning to live on a budget and $5 a month for an imaginary envelope is the opposite of that. I would maybe pay $1."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not incredibly fancy but a really good app for what it is supposed to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It takes some investigation to learn, but something new always does. Support feedback is on the ball. I would love to see a ""Getting Started Video"". A good narrated one that explains the definitions of terms use in Goodbudget as a new budget is being set up. Great app guys...good job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"First app I installed on my replacement phone, one of those apps that your always using and that you feel lost without."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Muy bueno! Te permite ser más organizado  Y te muestra lo que realmente te estas gastando en cada campo de ti vida."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works for me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget helps me to see where my money is going and get instant encouragement as I track my progress in getting closer to my goals to get the things that I want/ need. It's easy to use and gives me more freedom and control. I've used one from a national bank that wasn't as good (Ex. If I got household items at the grocery store, it would still be in my food category with their system.)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best budget app available, user friendly and really helpful for budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Once you fill the envelope there is no option to edit again ..every data you enter can't edit ..old style. .uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not very clear"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I find this has really helped me keep track of my money and stick to my budgets better"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is exactly what I need, using envelope model and have features like setting financial goals and tackling debt. What I don't like right now is the charging model. $5 a month is too much for me, but I give it a try and let's see if I'm still subscribing in the next 2 month. One time charge option will be great. With a reasonable price of course."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It does what it says, nothing special..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Difficult at first to get the hang of filling envelopes (I ended up with double in there some months by mistake and it was fiddly to undo) but once cracked, a brilliant app. I can't afford the ongoing fee though so can't add a credit card account which is annoying. This app does really help with keeping me accountable overall - thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Over complicated budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It won't update to the server so my wife and I can share. Please fix"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was looking for something that would let me keep track of my ever changing needs and income and this app is it! It is so simple and adjustable and I love that I can view my budget on different devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I've had it on here for three weeks and cannot understand how it works. So bad that we decided to just write down what we spend instead."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and deleted all my envelopes after I spent an hour making them"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and aesthetic"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This would be a great app if it did not limit the amount of expense deductions inputted by the user. If I only had 10 deductions monthly why would I need this app. Thanks but I'll move on!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great features implemented well. Like the rollover and that negative balances are allowed. USP is the ability to sync with one more device."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpfull tool for saving"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has helped our family save tons of money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been such a great asset to our family. Before Goodbudget we rarely paid attention to what we were spending. Now, every penny is accounted for and I'm excited to see how things will look for us at the end of the month!!! I also love the little feedback phrases the app gives you if you make good spending choices. This will definitely be an app that I'll recommend to friends and family!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, everyone should use a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app once you get used to it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is true to the concept of managing budgets through ""envelopes"" and if followed faithfully, will help maby people.  Being able to sync across multiple platforms makes it easy to check the balances in your envelopes before spending the corresponding money.  I would have given it 5 stars but there are areas where it doesn't seem very intuitive and can get a tad clumsy if you do things a little different that the normal (in our case, it's when we split envelopes across two accounts.)  But we still use it and I recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I were looking for a budget app we could each access from our phones, and this one is perfect for that. I also love the envelopes because I used to use real envelopes with cash to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app, it has a great layout to see your budget and log spending. The only downside is that some things are time consuming, such as changing your account income, editing envelopes, and adjusting the fill. Some things can only be done from the website. It is user friendly but not necessarily very intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent plan that helps to keep track of your finances in real time from multiple devices. Very helpful to avoid ""doing finances"" for 2 hours a week when you can stay on top of your finances every day. We are very glad we found it and will be requiring our children to establish their budget with the Goodbudget system before they leave home!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome and handy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, makes tracking expenses mobile and easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is simple enough to be quick for easy budget tracking, but also lets you keep track of accounts as well.  So now I can track everything on my phone and my husband can input his stuff and we all see the updates.  I've used excel and quicken in the past, but for household budgeting I find this app to be the easiest and most effective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love being able to easily keep track of my expenses...clean and easy to use interface"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For those wanting to budget the envelope way, this is simple and clean. You can also access stats via the web browser version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Keeping me on track. Really great. Could be slightly more intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the better budget apps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Won't let me do monthly outgoings.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I thought this was going to be a great app until I started entering our bills and half way through it wouldn't let me add any more because the limit had been reached, if I didn't have a lot of bill I wouldn't need an app...hello!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Until I realized there's a limit to how many free envelopes are allowed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I find that this app is really good. I already use the envelope system physically for the cash that I have each month. But now by using this app, I can apply it to the different categories I have for my account that I pay by card."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Berry good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, no ads, doesn't crash on my MotoX. Was using Budget Book but this app is MUCH better. Has the features I need with one exception: after moving money between envelopes, you can't tell on the home screen - looks like you stayed on budget when you didn't and the envelope total doesn't update in that view."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has really helped visualize monthly spending and all the results of 'breaking the rules'.  Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"So far what bothers me is the inability to label the folders with my own names or to have more than one in the same category. Plus that despite talk of the paid version of this app, I can't find it in the play store to check out what additional features are included to decide about trying that version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying using this app. Very simple and helping me keep on top of my finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, especially because it helps all who need access to finances can see where the money is going and what is left!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It really does help you know where all your money is going and where you need to make adjustments I love the envelope idea."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting tool ever!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This may be great for many, but we just didn't click. I found YNAB, and they offer a 34-day free trial software to try out. (and free classes on how to budget) Great value."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Goodbudget is really easy to use and syncs between my phone and desktop."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love how easy it was to create a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is great if used properly! It's easy to manage and because of the tracking of every transaction it has helped me save more money than I actually budgeted to save."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's been really helpful to have our envelopes sync between devices! That way my wife and I can each be in different places using the same envelope! Thank you for developing this very helpful (and encouraging!) app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I can't find a way to purchase more, plus there should be sub categories, such as groceries: food, non- food, and an itemized list of utilities etc."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app. Pretty limited with free version. The paid version much more versatile. Good paid customer service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app if you'd like to find out how much money you waste every month. Made a huge difference for me and my wife. As newlyweds we rely on this always to keep track of how much money we've each spent and how much we still have to spend. Syncs between our phone perfectly. Very well built and designed website and app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and simple design"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that it is shareable with my husband,  so we can stay on track, and know at a moments notice what's available.  I also love that you don't link specific banking information. Thanks good budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app and connected web service. Now I can still follow the envelope system without needing to carry actual cash and envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has already helped me save over $1,000. I love how easy it is to get started."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you  I love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I could vary on weekly/monthly/annual expenses/income, but it does the job"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app is definitely headed in the right direction, just lacking in the user interface category. It just isnt as intuitive as I would like.. also, as far as I can tell, missing the ability to add a reoccurring payment.. I know how much my insurance is every month and I know when they take it out of my account, so why not let the app handle that for me? I could see my self paying for this a couple updates down the road, but as is it's a solid app, with a TON of potential."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you want simple envelopes with no access to your accounts then this is the app. It's a virtual wallet, you just have to remember to add transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It keeps on crashing. Interface is not so user friendly. Sorry guys! But keep on improving. I'll check it back."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the most used apps on my phone. Great for organizing money and coordinating tracking between multiple people (free for two users on same account) . Aligns with Dave Ramsay's philosophy of giving a name for every dollar. Lots of flexibility in how to setup and use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is a great app but it lacks the option of having a 4 weeks pay income... rendering it useless to me. But apart from that it is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is so easy to record and see. Also, UI is user-friendly, so you can easily get used to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helps me to save money for large purchases. Very simple interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its simple to use and direct to the point. You budget your money into like virtual money putting into envelops of expenses. Simple! There are some features that is confusing but once you started using you'll get the hang of it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Finally, an app where I manage my different spendings. I love it. 4 star, because it took time to figure out how to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love this app for our budget. Simple and very easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is so easy and intuitive, has all the options I need and nothing more."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and i love how easy this app makes following our budget. Even the free version!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent, simple to use app. Very useful to keep running balances in all of your budget categories. Easily enter and allocate deposits to each category and enter expenses to each category. Very intuitive to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this to keep track of my budget every month.  I made my plan in excel and then keep track of where I am with my purchases in the app.  It is very useful and super easy...You just enter in the purchase in the app right after you buy something.  Definitely recommend.  You also can manage your money on your own unlike how many budget apps need your bank account information in order for the app to be useful.  But with this app I don't have to share that sensitive information in order to leverage the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely the best budget tool I've used. It's simple to use yet complex. However for some reason,the folders on my phone show up out of order. My wife's phone is fine and the online tool is fine. Note 4"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helping me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What a great app to keep everyone on the same page with where you are on your budget. Fits quite well with the Dave Ramsey program! Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a terrific app with a nice interface and many good features. The mobile app is great for entering information on the go, and the web-based site has  reports and other tools to keep track of your budget. When I had a question, it was answered by email by an actual person within 24 hours. You do have to get used to the concept of the envelopes and how to fill them, but once you understand that, this is a wonderful tool. Can't imagine being without it now. Totally worth purchasing the upgraded version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My life would be so much harder without this APP. There are some things that could be better in terms of reports etc. But they generally bring out some great changes with each version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Literally the best app for money-budgeting ever. I tried using Mynt but this was 10 times better for me and easier to use too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is a nice and simple app like I am looking for.  However, you can only split your income (paycheck) into two envelopes.  I did not see anyway to spread them across all evenly.  I do not want to put a whole paycheck in only one or two envelopes (items) of my budget.         Edit: Is that after I add the paycheck as a credit and put in my ""savings""?  I will look into it later.  I am only looking to make a budget, not fully track all my finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps me stay on budget! Pretty easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not as detailed as some of the other applications but easy to use.  Since it is easy to use, I am more likely to stick with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Good app but only for those who live like this. I don't keep envelopes. Maybe because I'm single. This app has very limited audience."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used a few programs. This one seems to work best for my needs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Needed a family budget app in which we can record expenses together. GoodBudget does just that and is easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps i ever used"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I set this up and needed to change envelopes and whole system went to zero. It's not user friendly even if you go online to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works great for us to keep track of money without actually handling cash"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best budgeting app I have used so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I liked the app. Good UI, features and easy to use. It isn't until completing all the details and setting up the whole budget list that we are informed about the pricing. I would be ok of I knew beforehand that for more than 10 types of expenses you need a 5€ MONTHLY. Uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped my wife and I to both account and budget. The result has been greater savings over the fee months we have been using the app and as such, greater financial freedom. This app is easy to use and aesthetically appealing. The best part of the app is that both my wife and I can access our data from our smartphones. I always have tabs on my finances. I recommend this program enthusiastically to all of my friends! Well done"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loving good budget. For the first time in years we know where our money is - and have made a savings plan. We're feeling like we can actually get somewhere now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Really helps me stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, a little confusing at first"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Its simple design is also very flexible. Makes budgeting that much easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You can't go wrong with this one"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not available on Windows. If 5 friends have to connect and 1 friend has a Windows phone the App becomes Useless."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple but functional"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Have to work around a few things to make it work the way I want it to, but there are lots of options that make that easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy this app and it is completely worth the annual subscription if you want to sync between two or more phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelopes! Our favorite part is how easy and fast it is to enter transactions. It's so easy that you go ahead and enter it before you leave the store!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Everything is great except the sync experience isnt seemless. Many times i have to sync manually. Also, reports on the mobile itself, or atleast a link to the web reports in the app would be nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It could be a little easier to navigate for certain things, but overall this is a good app that will help you set a budget and see where your money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app to keep track of the different categories we save for within our savings accounts. I've been using it for at least three years and have never had any trouble, although I only input manually."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a daily app for me. I can plan out my money long before it even hits the account and I'm always aware of where money is. Recommend for EVERYONE."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Second week using it and it's simple format is very easy to use and is helping me keep up with our spending. No bugs yet. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what a college student like me needs. The free version is available without limiting too much features (great job with this one), and the ability to sync with another devices is just brilliant. The UI could get more polishing (it looks a bit cluttered and confusing at first) but it still works for me. I can not recommend this enough. Use it. 9/10"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Lacks automatic envelop fill.. need to report on a monthly basis.. but good app in general. . Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping track of your spending as you spend it. No need to keep receipts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have tried to find an app or program that is better than this one. I have failed. It's simple in design which makes it manageable, and offers a financially relieving opportunity if you have the discipline."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, it helped me stay on budget last month (my first month using it)!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you are disciplined, this can help you a long way"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loving thé simplicity !@"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has everything I need to budget. I have been using it for 3-4 years and literally don't know what I would do without it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Liked it! It helps me see cleary where my money is going and helps me to stay in my budget. The interface was nice and simple. I also enjoyed the website linked to the app, which show all the details in beautiful figures."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Those who really want to budget, i'm suggest this apps. It also can update through internet too... Thumbs up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super helpful with keeping me on track with a tight college kid budget. Thanks to this I feel like I'm not just getting by, I'm making productive financial choices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Allowed us to organize our budget and to get  our spending under control.  We now have a name for every dollar that is spent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried both YNAB & Mvelopes, but this is the only software that provides the necessary tools to manage bimonthly pay periods.  It took some trial & error to get things set up initially, but now I couldn't imagine not using Goodbudget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect little budget tool for couples for everyday purchases."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Saving lots of money by keeping track of my finances. Wish it allowed more free envelopes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Until I saw that theres a limit as to how many bills you can add each month. Uninstalling."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app it works in real time and keeps everything balanced"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"couldnt tell what i was doing. instantly uninstalled sorry i will stick with my notebook"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome App, takes a bit to learn how to use, but great layout. Would be happy to pay money for added features if it was one off payment instead of subscription. Keep up the great work developers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nothing but excellent. Great way to stay in sync between husband and wife concerning the money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to track expenses in real time between my husband and myself"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is pretty much the only tool that has kept me on budget. The envelope system is great and works really well to keep you aware of your spending and allow you to move money around."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use it to help inform our purchases based off our weekly budget. Syncs perfectly between our two phones. Good visual design."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to record income and expenses to keep all members on same page"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's easy to organize with goodbudget, and helps me and my wife keep track of what we spend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I wanted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is simple and effective. Easy to use and keeps you accountable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very good thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can't use Dave Ramsey 's evrrydollar and the other budget apps are not what I need, this is just like using real envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good for budgeting monthly and knowing where our money had been spent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for a whole month now and it has been very beneficial. I was able to keep money in my savings account for the first time in a while."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love using this app. Being able to work from their web client and sync across phones is great. I have had a few crashes when adding transactions but nothing major."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great. It's really helping me save money and run my money instead of my money running me. Great budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and helps me stay on my household budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that the hubby and I can both track together!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I knew as I was setting up the account that I would need more ""envelopes"", so I intended to purchase a subscription. However, they want $45 per year! No way this is worth that! I would maybe entertain paying a $30 one-time license fee. Perhaps the developer could offer different packages. I have no need for the online version. I really just need unlimited envelopes, and maybe a simple export/backup function."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Wish it was unlimited folders but it's still plenty for budgeting purposes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I am very computer & Tech Savvy, yet I struggle with the use of this app. An optional quick tutorial to figuer out the use on the main web page would be very useful. Until than I am using other apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Goodbudget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use! Keeps me on track each month. I like that both my husband and I can use the same account and keep track together!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The app won't sync between my phone and my husband's.  It keeps saying it will try again later but it hasn't worked once.  The app would be good if it actually worked."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Title says it all"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use it everyday! Keeps us working together towards our financial goals. Highly recommended"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am so happy with this app!! The best feature is that it syncs between my android and my husband's iphone! So far it has worked perfectly, and I have been able to make it work using the free version. I will definitely think about upgrading to be able to further detail our expenses. I even had an issue and called customer service. They talked through my specific situation and solved my issue! Wow, who gives great and personal customer service anymore?! I'm super impressed with this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great,  simple app that does exactly what you need it to.  I only woah o could just buy a full version to get more envelopes instead of paying a monthly subscription"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful to keep my mindfulness of my own money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and edit monthly.  I do wish that you could check out the reports available on the website in the app.  It would also be nice to ""budget"" a monthly amount towards your goal envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I have more than 10 things to account for monthly so this otherwise great app is pointless for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For years I've struggled to keep track of our family's spending. This app makes it so easy - I always know where we're at and my stress level is at an all time low due to the feeling of control. Three years later and I still love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me track all my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the exact same concept as the envelope system that Dave Ramsey teaches. What's better is that it's electronic and on the device. I have been able to better track expenses because its where I need it when I need. The envelopes were challenging because either my wife had the cash or I had the cash. In this case, its based in your bank account balance so there is no need worry about cash envelopes. This app is great. Plus scheduled budget and scheduled expenses huge! Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Absolutely love this app. I've tried every other budgeting app including mint which automatically takes it out of your banking account. By manually entering all of my expenses, I truly understand where I am spending my money. The #1 feature that would perfect this app for me would be the ability to attach a picture of the receipt with each transaction. Manually entering the information is completely fine but having a photo for proof would be great. Would pay for that feature - easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for staying on top of your budget.  It's not perfect but the issues are minor (there's no ability to delete old business names so we have a couple of annoying misspelled names that continue to pop up, and it would be useful to have more envelopes available)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Only using the free features and so far it's great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A bit of a learning curve but worth the effort. Between the app on our phones and the web interface on our computers we have taken control of our finances and no longer have to ask each other ""where did the money go"" or ""do we have enough for money for (blank)."" To us it is well worth the $45 per year."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Does a great job of keeping me financially organized."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Control your money, control your life"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is very good for people wanting a simple way to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget is the BEST budget app! Very easy and effective!! Even my free spirit spouse uses it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need for my budget. 10 free categories, and since I had registered online when I switched phones, it all transferred seamlessly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its a great, simple app that does exactly what it says!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like it. It has been great with helping me keep my budget, but one thing i would like to be able to do is edit how much money is in my account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This was just what I was looking for.   My wife and I wanted to track our spending money, fuel and grocery shopping every month, so we can better stay on track with our big-picture budget.   We've tried several before, but never managed to stick with it.   The strength of GoodBudget is that we can use it from the PC, I use it on Android and the wife uses it on iOS - and everything all syncs up seamlessly.  I can check whether I'm ahead or behind of my spending budget for the month and we know when we've got to start switching to economy fish fingers and Supernoodles in our food shop. At the end of the month, we hit a single ""fill"" routine and all our totals are reset ready for the next month,   It looks a little dated and there are a couple of gurgles - behaviour's slightly different on each platform - but overall it's great for what we wanted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful and friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Stacking and racking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Hi! I really want to use this app but after account setup, on the main screen, when I click an envelope, the app force closes. Please help! Thanks! Galaxy e5 stock unrooted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I didn't understand this app at all. I put in $200 savings per month and it said I only accumulated  about $8."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used this for years and it's latest iteration is superb. Simplicity itself."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps keep us on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Had to up grade to the plus but it is great for keeping track of rental expenses. The program is great for my personal spending as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've been using this for a couple years now and it really helped us keep track of where our money went. It's given me hope since we've changed our money habits based on what we've learned from using it.  It also helps us know where we're at financially instead of guessing based on what the bank says at any given moment. We did decide to upgrade after using the free version consistently for a year."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The syncing feature makes budgeting as a couple so simple! Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used this for a year now, super helpful and easy to use! Our family finally maintains a budget now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful, simple, syncs well, love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app makes it much easier to set up and keep track of my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used EEBA (Goodbudget) for several years now, and my wife and I have been more than please. We believe, if you can't track it you cannot manage it. This tool let's me do both!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app really helps us to stay on track and in communication about our finances!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my once a month paycheck."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I think more envelopes should be available."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, web sync is awesome, pricing is a little high for the paid version, but the free version works well enough. $24/yr and it'd be a 5 star app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love love love this app. It lets me use the envelope system without having to literally carry around all the ""envelopes""... helps us stay on track and gives us the security of knowing where we stand financially at any time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you figure out how to use it,  it's great.  I use it for basic discretionary spending and I love that my husband and I can both access it. Also, i like that i use the website for setting up and making changes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app works fine...unfortunately"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Took me a bit to get all set up. And had to get the plus with canadian exchange which was fifteen dollars more. Not happy with that so already have a goodenvelop to save till next year but seriously need to rethink basically sixty a year?? Would agree as a one time fee or less."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app & program. If course with every program, it has it's minor glitches & issues, but over it us still awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is easy convient and just what a frugal person needs.  :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The envelope method is perfect for managing expenses in different areas of the household budget. The graphics let me know at a glance how much remains in each envelope. Just what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the perfect budgeting app for  me.  It is exactly what I have always looked for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You can only trial it fully if you only have a few expenses. If you want to add more you have to buy it. But I'm not going to buy it unless I can fully trial it. so it's a ridiculous limitation and I have to go to the next app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helping me balance my books easily"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I set up my budget but i now want to subtract what ive spent from that envelope,  how do i? It just says ""add specific amount. ."" I dont want to add I was to subtract."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After 10 Years of marriage we finally found what works for us. Thank GOODNESS. We've tried spreadsheets, envelopes of cash, & other systems, but this finally works for us. We are very happy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Notepad works too and also doesn't support reoccurring payments."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budgeting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app really help me stay on  budget and save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like the idea, but the limited amount of envelopes before you have to start paying a subscription, makes this app pointless. Give more envelopes and charge me $5 Month for something worth while."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has helped me stick to my budget and save 75% more effectively than before. Also allows me to move funds around when unexpected things come up. I do wish it would let me keep track of how much I put into savings as a seperate account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App! Has helped me budget tremendously!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for us. Used it since last October 2014 and helps tracking expenses and budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app does not allow you to make changes to your budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Syncs between my wife's and my phone pretty easy!..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Keeps doubling the incomes I set, I deleted and saved and they wont go away. Useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helped a lot on managing your money however small it is!  Haha! Thank you Goodbudget.  :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great envelope app that will keep you on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"this app helps us to keep track of our monthly budget and it syncs perfectly between our devices"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for several years it helps me keep tabs on my spending and where I'm bleeding money. The most user friendly one I've found"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just not quite what I wanted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app will make you be more in control and responsible of your budget! The syncing feature is an absolute best between myself and my wife! We're always on the same page"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No nonsense budgeting for busy people on the go. Highly recommended"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good to keep track of spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its great still i feel with this tool I'll finally get on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Will only allow ONE bank account. Will not allow a savings account or credit card account without subscription. I can understand subscription if the accounts synced to my bank. All I want to do is enter my balances manually on my Checking, savings and credit card accounts. But this app only offers ONE checking account for free and you have to pay $45.00 a year to add a savings account and credit account. This app is worthless without those essential accounts. Will delete!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best envelope style budgeting so I can get ahead of my bills. However it really needs a way to reconcile with my bank so I can make sure I'm but missing anything. A little check box at least so I can check off things that have cleared and keep track of things like checks that take longer. Maybe I'm missing this but it would make the app a 5 star."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped our family stay on track with our budget. I highly recommend it. My only complaint is that the app won't allow transfers between envelopes. I have to go to website for that. Other than that, it's very convenient."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for what I need it for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget tracking app hands down! This has made a huge difference in our lives.  My husband and I can stay on the same ""page"" with our spending via the shared app between smartphones. I love the cheeky personality of the envelope and its feedback on our entries--so exciting to see the numbers really working for us at long last. We recommended GB highly to all of our fellow Financial Peace University classmates.  Keep up the great work!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helps me keep track and allows better financial communication between me and the wife."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app each week for my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's really nice and helped me to monitor my expanses . I recommend to automatically add salary on specific date . Also by mistake I removed the saving envelope and don't know how to add it again"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect and simple, I'm so going to envelope system"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for daily and weekly budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to keep my husband and I on track. Love that you can sync it between devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Ability to sync across iPhone and Android is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app to track my daily expenses. Used together with the online version allows me to stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the fact that my husband and I can share it even when life gets busy we can see how we are doing with our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good, could be a bit snappier, but very good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love sync option"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it - easy to use, two devices and sync allows my wife and i to always be on the same page and avoid going over budget"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Changed my life"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use it to keep track of our budget. It syncs instantly between our phones so we always know how much money we have left for the month in each category we set up. We love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Minor tweaks could make  this app amazing. If you could take a picture of receipt that would ve awesome.  That way when you looked at who you paid you could remember what you bought that you may not have needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app every. I use it everyday and never have a bounced check lol."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, as budgets must be."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy for my partner and i to keep track of expenses. Only suggestion is to add regular income topups."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"You might struggle with how it works at first, but don't stop trying the app is really worth it in the end. Only you can really save money but at least you can see where its going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"At one glance , I know how much I have in each envelopes real time! Great tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that this app updates live  between my husband and myself. No problem using it over the last four months."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it should do, keeps track of your money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good Budget has been a big help in keeping us within our limits."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My favorite app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I can do the Dave Ramsey ""envelope"" approach virtually rather than dealing with cash filled envelopes. Now we can also have savings goals and I really enjoy watching that green line fill up the screen. May seem silly but it's motivational."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helped me a lot :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Widget is smart and easy too. Great tool."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app and support"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Get the job done, plus is free up to 10 envelopes, needs a little work to record transactions  cause of that 4 stars.update: I became a paying user. love the web app, I still feel mobile app is lacking something. Keeps 4 stars. New update: I love it,  I just feel is kind of expensive 3 dlls would be the sweet spot. 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm on the Dave Ramsey plan and used these ""envelopes"" to help pay off my student loans."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best app for keeping track of your expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, we were able to first record what we were doing to see where we were going wrong, adjust our expectancy and then monitor that we were spending correctly.  Fantastic app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Simple; sensical; and easy to use. Update 7/3/15 after two months of daily use: disappointed over not being able to make corrections and adjustments easily. For example, I'd like to be able to just delete the envelopes and payments for the week (I work on a weekly allowance) and start over. Can't seem to find the way to do that. It's turned into a big enough problem that it's worth starting again with another app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am a college freshman and this app has helped me out so much."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is a great app, it helps us to stay on track with our finances and have a shared budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Could be a little easier to edit but works well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried a lot of budgeting app, and so far this has been working wonders for me. Easy to use and understand. I've been using it for 2 months now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Like this app a lot for keeping track of expenses. Useful for the most part but it does have a few things that I find a little confusing but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's been my goto budget app for almost 3 years now. Simple and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've been using this program for a few years to help us plan and budget. It does require daily effort to make sure all expenditures are recorded, but any budget plan would require that. I have found this so helpful, that I paid for the premium program, although don't really need the features. My wife and I both have this in our phones, and so when either of us put in a expenditure, it syncs and both of us have the same info. Really we have learned to budget by using this program. It's great. Thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple design, easy to use, excellent app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"To keep track of your spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a while and can't do without it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this to track savings. Already from the fact that it shows I spend too much on beer, I have no complaints."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome Best yet.  Still using this a year later and our budget just keeps getting better saving money never so fun."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best system for envelopes and cash accounts.  GUI could be more intuitive."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice appln"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and has made budgeting fun!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has changed the way I live for the better. I suggest it to people all the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I find this app very useful but it's lacking functionality and that beautiful material design I've come to love."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for budgeting with the hubs!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for managing your spending...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for fans of Dave Ramsey"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps me so much with keeping up with my day to day expenses. I love it. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm rich; thanks to this service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I wish it was easier to edit and check real time expenses. I was going for simple but it miscalculates and there's no way to know what's going on"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps every day"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app every day to track my spending. The end of the month budget reports are awesome!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After four years of abortive budget attempts using all manner of weird and wonderful spreadsheets, FINALLY something simple which has allowed my wife and I to easily keep a budget and effectively save money. Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps keep track of my spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope design is very nice and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Could you please put in the ability to change to fortnightly and weekly instead of only monthly.  That would be awesome. Def 4 stars then."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app so far no problems,  maybe add a widget to show a running total of remaining money in budget for easy access on home screen or other screens."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It was a way to keep track of our expenses as a family so we can maintain a healthy balanced budget. Love that we both have access to it and it syncs immediately."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its so perfect for managing households finance. Wish its free or provide more envelopes for free"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using Goodbudget since February of 2013. It's very easy to use and very capable as well. This app (and on the Web) allows me to track (and coordinate with my wife) my spending, but more importantly, it makes it easy for me to decide how I am going to spend my money. I have a category for my gasoline costs, my car repairs, my entertainment, my clothes, utilities, mortgage, miscellaneous expenses, gifts, food, tithing, my personal allowance and more. I can't say more as I've run out of space!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. It helps me stay totally on top of all my income and expenses. I know where every cent is being spent/saved. It allows me to keep on top of my financial situation and plan for the future. It's simple and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great little app. We use a simple but effective envelope budget. This app let's us keep track of our budget online and on our cell phones with just a glance.  Very convenient and easy to keep track of our expenses versus our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hidden fees and charges"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This really helped me out when moving and trying to remember payments"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, very effective"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Budgets are dull and painful to start with it. This didn't help."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app,  but I wish the app would allow the same things as the website,  such as between envelope transfers."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been extremely useful for me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can use on laptop or phone, entries sync with hubbys.  Best budget for family use we've found.  Does everything we need, although we upgraded."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand instructions and web support makes this app my favorite budgeting tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Really helps keep of all your money. Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Goodbudget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The spending money part makes sense. The earning money part not so much. I guess I just need a little more instruction."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Exactly what I needed. Free version more than adequate. Minor bug, the ordering of annual/irregular envelopes is not working in the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes sticking to a strict budget and keeping your spending in check effortless. Especially great along the four You Need A Budget guidelines."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It was amazing help us, and more wisedom everything are save more budget planning."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use and keep track of budget envelopes. I cannot recommend it enough."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps keep our family communicating about money, and not over spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like this app and would rate it higher but I can't get the mobile app to sync with the website which makes it much less useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Does not support multiple currencies for different accounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I was enjoying it but the app sync wouldn't work so I signed out and when I signed back in all my saved information was lost..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app. My wife and I found it very easy to use and extremely helpful for keeping track of daily expense. If monthly fee is USD2, we will seriously consider subscription."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have multiple savings accounts and money tins to save for various things. I use this app a little differently - i open envelopes with a savings goal in mind and pop money in each one depending on account/tin deposits i make. Super easy to use and helps me to keep track of how much I have saved."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Using for over a year now.  Really helps me to understand and bound my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been  a life saver and a marriage saver."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Live it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, plenty of envelopes to keep track of different things"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I realized I had more expenses than envelopes...annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice and simple, but would prefer a one-time purchase over a subscription base plus service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We just started using it & I know there are other ways we can benefit from this app but just starting it has helped us visualize our spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the only envelope budgeting app I could find that allowed me to create a budget on a bi-monthly basis."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Been using it for years (since it was EEBA).  Simple to use.  Always one of the first apps I install on a new device."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"hope you update it into material design on your future update"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good system for budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"helped me to know my expenses and thus plan..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Pointless to have a budgeting program that doesn't even add right 2200 + 400 does not equal 7865"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Initial set up was a peice of cake. Later though, I had to make adjustments to my budget and found that to be tricky. Made a new envelope with -$70 in it. I left it that way and just focused on the rest. I have not mastered moving into next week with leftover cash. Ads in the free part are not excessive.  Once I get the transaction and adding mid week down I'll think of this app as a 5 star, but because the adding and transition is not clear...4."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app makes it easy to use the envelope budgeting system for two people - I love that it syncs immediately so my husband and I know exactly how much we have left in each envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"For some reason it will not sync, everything else for me is great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It should be easier to correct mistakes but overall great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I loved the app, had it back when it was Ebba and it worked fine then. When I reinstalled on this device, it's been having problems syncing since day 1 (I'm running 4.4.4 KitKat). I tried to fix this issue by myself since support was no help. Now it crashes every time I try to reload my envelopes. Delete!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple for my wife and I to transition from physical envelopes to this, and cross device sync is awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really i love this app...very  useful for me and my life..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Particularly appreciate that I can put aside money for those annual purchases that I would otherwise not budget for on a weekly basis."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the positive reinforcement pop ups! As silly as they are, they make you smile a little even when your budget looks grim!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"really helped me start getting G my finances in order"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really like this app and find the free one meets my needs which is great. Only thing I'd love to see is a summary of my running total monthly spend vs budget telling me how far ahead / behind I am in total as ultimately that's the most important thing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I had to start over a few times as I figured out how to use it, but it's been good and very helpful now that I have a system down. I only wish it had a place where it automatically calculated the budgeted total. It has the total $ in your envelopes for month and all envelopes. But I would like another total of the budgeted amount so I can see that I have not budgeted more than we make."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"PlugTheFunEnd"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy way to manage your money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So far so good, does everything I need it to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Started using both app and website. Great way to take care of finances :)"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for budgeting and tracking expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I want :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not what I wanted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you wanna do Dave Ramsey without going all cash, this is a great envelope system to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app. It is a budgeting concept we have always used but now my wife and I can sync wherever we are. Makes running a house much easier!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice format. Like that you can budget weekly instead of monthly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Cool app so far, buuuuut... sync is down. Heavy subscription cost! 45usd per year beware. Edit: Fixed sync issuea my logging out/in"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We were looking for an electronic envelope system that was easy enough for my husband :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have a hard time stito a budget, but one day I said, ""Enough!"" and went for it. I'm so glad I did because of the accuracy of this app! Once you get the hang it, It's also pretty easy to use. Remember to save your receipt and happy budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works perfect on my tablet. I love this app. I wish I could budget some of my envelopes as monthly and some bi-weekly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried and tried so many budgeting apps, and all of them required entering in your bank account info. I don't care how ""safe"" your info is, I won't enter that kind of stuff in. I just wanted something to keep track of my spending, and this is the perfect tool! I can fill envelopes, and it will take out the amount I spend. Just what I need! ❤"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I didn't like the auto fill feature and want my money back"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Keeping me focused on sticking to the budget on the go... I always pull the phone to check whether or not, I can afford using the spend categories and the limits set..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I just recently upgraded from the free profile and it is well worth it. I can see all my accounts now and track my spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used this back when it was Easy Envelop, makes it easy to stay in budget and not over draf my checking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand, does everything I need. Very well made app, highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use on a daily basis. Smooth interface, clear displays, and clean visuals. Has made me radically more responsible and aware of my money flow."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lovely app for budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app is great. I use it everyday, more than any other one really. But are there any plans to implement charts and graphs like on the website? It would be pretty convenient to have those at hand as opposed to having to go to the website every time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Perfect if you're good at entering your own spending ;)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I loved this app! It works really well, easy to use and assign envelopes and transactions. ....but LOVED. Not LOVE. It refuses to sync to server even with a constant full signal. So they advise to log out and log back in again. WHICH DELETED ALL PREVIOUS DATA. Needs a bug fix urgently!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just like evelope system but on my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Free with no ads, easy to use, very functional"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Take some time to adapt on the workflow, but when you do you realize that this is a pretty efficient methodology. The implementation is very good with hidden automation gems. The free plan is enough to start with."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It difficult to used, is difficult fill the envelopes from ur monthly budget, is not going to be possible to fill them or take to much time, will be better keep doing physically, but is a good concept hope get better and easy to use in future releases"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"After spending a great deal of time setting up, I realized hat there are ""limited""  number of envelopes for the budget. Very disappointing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I am paid every two weeks on Friday but I budget monthly because for instance I pay rent with one check, but the next one is used for other bills. Is there a way to budget monthly without having to designate a start date which is always changing?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is great for beeping me keep track of where I need to look more closely at my budget and keeping spending under control"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app... I can monitor my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Two problems.  One, they want you to sign up for their site.   I just want the info on my phone.  And two, you can only choose between monthly and semi monthly.  I have some expenses I want to pay monthly and some semi monthly.  No real way to do that on here."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"... And helps me stay on track. Great app, highly recommend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's great helps me see that if your spending ""extra"" money your taking it from something"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I have had to repeatedly uninstall this.  First it wouldn't synch with the website then it wouldn't fill the envelopes properly. Finally it wouldn't let me reset and start again. crap."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, really useful,practical budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have been using the envelope system for years, but it has really bothered me to be keeping a big amount of money outside the bank.. Thankfully, I was introduced to this app by a friend. I'd like to give it a 5 star, but the sort order of the envelopes annoys me. When selecting the envelope to get the budget from, it doesn't follow the sorting order set when editing the envelopes. It just follows the order of when the envelope was created. Fix this and a five star will be given.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"PERFECT app to help me keep track of my finances. Easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for 3 years and it rocks! I wanted something that linked between both my husband and my phones. This does exactly that! I could never do the Dave Ramsey cash envelope system but I can totally do this envelope system! We only use what is placed in each virtual envelope. So cool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Had everything I needed. Superior to the other budget apps I tried. BUT, the payed version is subscription. If you changed it to a one time payment I would be happy to buy. But 5 dollars a month isn't worth it. I only want a couple more envelopes (In the interest of your money I would suggest you make a payed version where you give the unlimited envelopes)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"For someone with zero financial savvy this app just frustrated me with how it worked. A tutorial would of been nice with easing you into it. -income - bills - daily expenses. Thats all I was after."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Was disappointed with this, it was what I was looking for, but when I logged in all my folders were gone and kept crashing. Although I am giving it another go (after trying a few more apps this seemed the easiest to understand and had the better options) crossing my fingers that I don't lose my folders again. Have kept with this and haven't had much more trouble with it. The only problem I had was trying to change my income and it wouldn't save. But I haven't lost anything. I'm really liking this app now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"My husband uses this app, and recommended it to me for keeping track of expenses while we were on vacation. It's easy to learn to use, and the sync with the web is a great feature, but for every day use I find the free version is not helpful enough and the subscription is more than I'm willing to pay. Back to Mint I go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and does exactaly what its suppose to, I recommend to anyone😆"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps my family keep track, love that it syncs across all our devices"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It can't even subract or anything right.   Whoever made this app needs to recheck the math.  Worst app ever!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for about a year now. And it had become a core of mine and my girlfriend finances. Works flawlessly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fair amount of features in free version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely the best budget app I've used!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for sharing a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you are familiar with the envelope budgeting system this is a great, safe way to manage your money! Instead of leaving envelopes of money in your house, you can keep it safely in the bank and still manage it virtually on your phone and on the web. The free version gives you one account and up to 10 envelopes, which for me it perfect! I may even consider paying for the better version which gives you unlimited accounts and envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Liked it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Still learning how to use it but, so far, it does everything I need done"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Thanks to Goodbudget, now managing my personal finances on the go is convenient & simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helped keep a perspective on your spending and savings goals. Great analytical tools on the website too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I have enjoyed using goodbudget, but there is still much room for incremental improvement. And unfortunately,  they don't seem to have much development going on. Their roadmap hasn't changed in 6 months and only a few minor fixes. Why pay for an app that doesn't have much invested to stay competitive?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice :-) finally got a good app for a small household. Easy, practical and still helpfull 👍"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very good app with an easy to follow approach to budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so simple to use. I love the graphics. I've been using it for more than a year and its the best free app I've found for tracking my spending and keeping a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Its a great app, however once I logged out I couldn't get back in no matter what I did nothing seemed to work"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Looks pretty good but far too complicated for what I'm doing. After filling out my monthly expenses and clicking Next I was just looking at ""envelopes"" of the expenses I'd already recorded and no clue how to go about managing anything."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It won't sync... I tried several things but had to redo everything on the Web & uninstall / reinstall app. Now it works."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Started using this and it is so easy. Would recommend to anyone trying to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is helpful, but I get paid monthly and would like to be able to set which date my months start. (Ex: Since I get paid the 27th, I'd like for it to start over the 27th of each month.)  If there is already a way to do this and I haven't found it, please let me know."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful.  We rely on it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpfull app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The account can be managed online and oso by apps, so far quite good, just tat not much function inside."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful with budget, though not especially user friendly and took a little to figure out"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Get error ""can't connect to internet cloud"", says it will try later, the app stops working and force closes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It simply and effectively does what it says it does."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I rate it four stars because I feel like it could be a little better. It definitely helps. And is a wonderful tool works well. I recommend it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app! I love that my husband can access it on his phone too! Just one question, how do I get it to refresh and the beginning of a new month? Mine wasn't doing that automatically."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With this app, I am now actually able to save! Knowing exactly where my money is going to (down to the last cent) is the best thing ever! Thank you, DaySpring Technology! 😀😀😀"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I was using real envelopes and receipts. This app saves time and paper! I love how i can keep track of my spending. The free version is good for me. The trick part i found was i fill my envelopes automatically in the beginning of the montj and my envelopes are negatice but when i age paychecks i get a surplus. If there was a way to fill envelopes and add income later id be happier"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Locking the user in portrait mode is not good,  especially on a tablet."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I was excited about this app.  Got all my envelopes set up and after I  registered all my envelopes disappeared and now force closes!  Sucks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Setting up and refilling the envelopes can be a bit confusing, but after getting the hang of it, I have a good rhythm. I've used this app for a year and feel like I have much more control over my spending habits. The trick is to use it and stick with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nicely done app...I've tried many like this ...this one is the winner."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"If I have to log into internet there is no point for the app. And everytine I gulled my envelopes the next time I tried to log money the envelopes were empty ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app is really great. I'm very pleased with it. The only thing that bothers me is that in the current design, the button for adding a transaction is all the way in the top instead of the bottom, and that switching from expense to credit takes two button presses instead of one.  These two problems didn't exist in the previous design"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So simple, we love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been working with this app for less than a month. I might not be utilizing all its functions, but I like that it keeps me aware of my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that I can share my envelope with my household and we all have access on our phone. probably not as good as using cash as you can still go over but we are much more aware of what we are sending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app that's incredibly simple to setup and easy to use with advanced features if you're looking for them!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would like to fill envelopes manually but not working well. Makes me identify total income and I don't want to. Just trying to track certain spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's quite good. We are actually considering getting the premium version if it works out well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Works without glitches!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful and easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Envelopes concept is amazing. However it should be possible to budget for future periods. It should be possible to check for old envelop budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it to track spending, not to track every penny. If you're willing to pay more to do that that's fine but this just helps my  wife and I keep spending in perspective."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"As a Dave Ramsey fan, this app helps us keep virtual envelopes. It is really the only app that allows you to mimic a physical envelope system accurately."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"An excellent budgeting app using the envelope method. Easy and clear to use. I paid for the annual subscription and not sure if I will renew after a year as it's quite steep after exchange rates to AUD. If it was a cheaper subscription or paying for the app once off i'll be happy to keep using this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app! its really helping me to figure out where my money is going an to stay on top of my bills. The only thing I cant figure out is that I get paid every 2 weeks an where I am supposed to put my check amounts. How i am supposed to make all this in line with my checking account also wondering if each month my envelopes start over automatically or how I refill them."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really useful love the envelopes and so easy/user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Generally helps us track money the way we want. It helps us out a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good thing, we can know how much we spent and how much left to spend.  Its good to be kept in the budget but not ober it like always"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and see how I am spending my money and track expenditures throughout the month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Doesn't allow me to add an envelope with a positive balance from my phone. Frustrating. Other than that, it's a very useful app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for planning"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My fiance and I both have this app on our phone. It helps us both always know what is going on financially. Very user friendly as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to create a budget and record expenses to help keep on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great app, although the filling of envolopes is a little clunky (and, for my purposes, unnecessary). Still, amazingly useful for day -to-day budget tracking."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"After using it for a month, I found manually filling envelope is inconvenient. It does not hav many functions like produce charts , incert photos, etc. The reason giving 2 stars is because it still provides fundamental functions for free unlike Toshl. I started to dislike it because it wanna charge monthly bill for extra envelopes and export???  FINALLY Pocket Expense has released its android version n DEFINITELY I LL BUY PRO caz it's really useful n only CHARGE ONCE FOR AMAZING FUNCTIONS."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app was perfect for my husband and I to communicate about our budget. I love that it uses visual bar graphs for me and it is easy to use. It is a way for us to accurately keep track of our finances. We each have it on our phone so we don't have to always talk about each purchase. I love it and would recommend it to anyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I think I'm using it wrong, as in not to its fullest potential, but it works just fine for what I need. Especially for free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best part of this app is its very efficient widget which makes it one touch budget app. I choose this one for the very reason that it can sync across two devices. Thx for giving this app. Budgeting can not be more effective. 10 +10 envelops are sufficient for normal budgeting. How ever if one time cost were there i would be happy to contribute. Though i would suggest to add functionality to give monthly, yearly total spending for each kind of item"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Turns budgeting into a bit of a game with each encouraging comment when you add an entry, it's got me keeping up with the plan where usually I would have lost interest by now... Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Worked fine until today when it started asking for money. Now I can't even see my budget unless I want to delete envelopes or pay them money. No thanks, plenty of free budget apps and programs out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's ok. I find the allocation of income difficult and time consuming. It's hard for me to locate my budgeted income anywhere,  app or Web. I'll stick it out a little longer to allow for the learning curve to level off, not as intuitive as I would like. Having tasks like selecting folders then a one button fill allocation would really help.  This task would not allow you to fill if the selected envelopes remaining fill amount (budgeted -  month's fill allocation)exceeded the amount to allocate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been the perfect tool to help us stay on budget  easy, and works across pc, droid, ios,"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app. Both my husband and I can see it because we've synced our account and it really works for us!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Luv the app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the function of the app and what it does but the part where you have to fill envelopes and your budget and name them all is confusing. Why can't I set monthly budgets and have it automatically refill unless otherwise directed?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app!!! Makes tracking my finances very easy! Very user friendly!  The only app I've found that I've liked. 5 star all the way!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me track my expenses and enabling me to save a lot..... Much needed app for everyone. The interface is so well thought...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I always considered my way of budgeting to be the best for me and i was really hesitant to try this because i like to stick to what works.  But this has seriously changed the way i was doing my bills overall. Definitely the best way to budget all bills and stuff you want to save for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a very useful and helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The transactions are so quick and easy! We really enjoy the accountability of the envelopes and the clarity of knowing how much extra (""unallocated"") we have at any given time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic way to keep your finances on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps me visualize where my money is going. Helps me busget. The little comments after entering a transaction need to go. Can't figure out how to fill envelopes to budgeted amount. Instead, it fills with budgeted amount + leftover. Needs reports like the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app... gave us control and awareness of our expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for getting back on track with your money. I love that my husband and I can enter transactions on the go and each can see what the other is spending on. It has created a new found marital harmony regarding finances that our paper budget lacked."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the best budget app avaliable. If you need an app to help you and your family  to stay on budget then this your app. It lacks rich reporting features and analysis tools, but for me they are more hip than useful. Also you mighr need to spend around half an hour on the website and on the app to be able to set your financial account and start to use the envelopes. But once done everything downside road is smooth and rewarding."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app that helps to monitor your expenses . Though, wish to have more options to view and analysis monthy expenses. Eg. More tools to generate monthy report..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easily becomes a good habit."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Encourages you to keep to the budget by making it clear how much you have left to spend in each category (envelope)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A very nice app for budgeting with the envelope concept. Also able to see statistics in the web version. There is a bug, though, in mobile version, in ""edit envelope"" view, in the annual/irregular sections, the envelope list cannot be swapped (actually it can, but it seems to be off by one index, causing the first envelope in that section to not be swappable)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Can be complicated for beginners but after some time playing around, the app should be manageable for all."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great little app and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using Goodbudget for more than a year now. My wife and I sync envelopes and have no issues staying on budget. We don't use the paid options as we only need envelopes and no sync with bank accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Monthly fee is kind of ridiculous, but I guess there is some server maintenance to consider?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good plans, takes a little bit to figure out how to make it all jive.  Not good if you want to import. I don't want to see it is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Diggit"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me to stay on track. Know exactly how much I can spend and save. Working towards a goal. Amazing app & easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Could use a little tinkering but once you get it started it gets the job done."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great program keep up good work with this program"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"When I fall behind on my records (and let's face it- who doesn't?), it's hell for me to update everything. Need something a little easier to comprehend and manage."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helps me stay on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I expect great things!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Shows me where the money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just learning the ins and outs.  I definitely enjoy the portability!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The free version works well enough for me but considering upgrading to have a longer history and to keep track of credit cards as well. We'll see how it goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Financial life master. Annual subscription totally worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Meh..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it a lot"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you succeed to get into the habit of inputting your expenses ( thank you for the widget)  it's a very good app to have. I'm using the free version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am so aware of my spending now...keep it up..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. .it's a a lil difficult  initially but once you get it. ..great app for managing your money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app consistently for a while now and my husband I both love it. I like how we can both enter purchases separately on our phones and it syncs them all together. I use the free version and have not had any issues with needing to upgrade to the paid version yet. This app has definitely been key for us keeping track of our monthly spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I'd like to see recurring transactions, so I don't have to put one by hand in every time I pay for my Netflix etc.  I like the ability to sync between 2 people, but I don't think the ""envelope method"" is for me. Setting a budget per tag, yes, but having to manually fill the envelopes with money is just unnecessary."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Geat app. I use it everyday"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Confusing as heck. And I have to buy to get more envelopes. And it doesn't automatically deduct from my accounts. No thanks. Not worth it. Deleted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"One of the better budget apps. I really like the envelope method. But It's hard to limit myself to just 1 account though. I wouldn't mind buying the upgrade, but for a flat fee. I'm not interested in a monthly subscription."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is really helpful.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It does so much more online but app is good for a snap shot. The sync between the both is immediate! So cool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been looking for an app just like this for a very long time thank you.  It has been a huge help!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Every time I click on one of my budget categories to open it and see the description the ""Goodbudget has stopped working"" window pops up. Why is it doing this?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's easy to use and only takes a second to input what I have spent so I will keep on top of my budget. I like the envelope idea because it reminds me of the TV show Til Debt Do Us Part"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Made a huge transformation of our household budget. We were unable to get on the same page with spending and when we implemented this app we are quickly getting out of debt. I love the multiple devise syncing. Manual entry helps keep track better. If they could add a tab for tracking debts similar to a debt snowball that would be amazing! Keep it up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app! My husband and I have done cash envelopes for 12 years but... who uses cash anymore? This is exactly the same but more convenient. It's awesome! I do have 2 small complaints. Personally, I'd sooner pay $100 one time than an ongoing $5 monthly subscription. And sometimes I have trouble splitting a purchase into more than 2 envelopes. It's supposed to automatically give you a third one if the first two don't add up to the purchase total. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. No biggie."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I and my wife are going to subscribe to it so we can budget better and see what wast we are spending on and build an emergency reserve!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great for keeping my husband and I up to date on our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Not free after 10 envelopes budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It was doing a simple job for me but then all of a sudden it started adding extra income to my budget. And now everything is getting screwed up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I'd put the info on one screen but on another screen it would be different. I found it confusing how to do things and how much money I had left to budget after bills. Won't be using anymore"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It constantly tells me it has a sync issue and it wont sync with server."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Needs a bill reminder.  Than i would consider paying for it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used many budgeting apps but this one suits me very well. It has been so many years. Back then only 100,000+ downloads. I'm happy to see the users grow. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that it syncs between two phones no more nagging my husband!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really wish the app could connect to my account so I didn't have to enter everything manually. The lack of this feature kind of makes the app a chore, which becomes a hassle."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its  very useful. Must try."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This being a free app, I was really hesitant to see if it would be something that I/we could use and stick with. It has been a lifesaver! The sync feature with another device is great too! Keeping up with our spending has never been eaiser. I am not a ""techy"" person and this is perfect for me. Thanks Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like it so much for the budget management. This apps help a lot. Like it so much."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've always done my budgeting on papwr because I couldn't find an app that allows me to allocate my money the way I wabt. The only thing that would be helpful would be to hVe an app that automatically syncs with my bank account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am really glad I found this app. It has helped me keep track of my spending. I would recommend this app to anyone that has trouble holding onto there money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that it syncs with my husband's phone so we have a current budget to work with."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The whole point of an app is to not have to use a website on my phone. Totally defeats the purpose."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Well I had issues. Deleted alllll my transactions and still couldn't get Unallocated to Zero out. On to the next :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Within the last 6 months I began using this app​ to keep track of my spending. I had known how to budget before but it often became too tedious to write down  everything I spent. This mobile app helps me to do just that. Every time I make a purchase (or receive money :) ) I can immediately put it into my phone. At the end of the month I can see where my money has gone and adjust my budget to suit. I feel as though Goodbudget is a wonderful and life-changing addition and I would recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great way for me and my wife to keep track of our spending/budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I accidentally deleted my last review. Basically it's a good app if you have simple needs. A developer replied about my comment about not being able to transfer money back to unallocated. He suggested to delete the fill. However, I still want the fill (don't want to delete the entire thing), I just want to moved the money from a single envelope back to unallocated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great!  It is very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Wife and I can keep track of budget without the logistics of actual cash envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like manually entering my credits and debits, so having an app that allows me to do so works for my personal needs, especially since my husband can enter debits too. I've also never used an envelope system, but I like it. Filling my envelopes gives me the same kind of satisfaction as paying something off or making a purchase, but without using my actual money. Will go a few months and then decide on whether to get the paid version so that we can track our savings and IRA contributions this way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budget spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Hello, I just downloaded this app and it seems good but what I would like to have is a envelope that just displays a single balance of money I have, through a custom number input, no bank sync necessary. And so when I fill in an envelope the balance also gets reduced and transfered to the envelope. This would be really great as I'm sure others would enjoy it as well. Thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Did it's job, was straight and to the point."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great way to stay on budget with rest of family"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just started our second month with this app (free version). It works! It would be great to automate filling envelopes at the beginning of each month, but pretty good overall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"There is not room for laziness with this app if you are serious about your budget! I personally don't include my families savings and live 'payslip to payslip' with envelopes dedicated to 'savings', 'gifts', 'holidays'. At the beginning of each month I allocate the budget into the envelopes (including a monthly estimate of bills that are paid quarterly and annually so we are prepared) and the total sits as a negative sum in 'unallocated money' and as we are paid I add it in. Works for us!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Awful.  Cannot organization nothing.  Difficult to understand.  I created a budget for each envelope and want each envelope to reset fresh. But it does not. Instead it takes my pay check amount and splits it into each evelope. I need just to set my budget so I can track if I am going over. App is bs. Do not waist time with this. Other then that I have no strong feelings :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Gives you flexibility and a nice interface to work your budget. Just robust enough without being complicated! Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app but paid version a little expensive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I found the controls to be unintuitive and restrictive. Its designed for linked-in automated filling of envelopes and little else.  If you want to do it by fortnight,  too bad. If you want to shuffle money from x envelope to y envelope,  too bad. You can't set a date for your paycheck in the future. It prompts you to distribute money even if all envelopes have reached budget.  There are better options."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to keep track of our expenses and whether they are ok for our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is simple to use and has all the features you need. Very impressed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful because one account can be easily accessed from multiple devices and they all sync up making it easy to know what is being done by other members of the family/group. Right now i am using the free version but am considering buying the full version in the future. Thanks to the developers for such a helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'll admit, it did take a while to get the hang of it, and I did put it down for a couple of months out of discouragement. BUT, I just recently gave it another go, and I am now loving it. I think this will be just what we need to get our spending back under control. I have tried a few other apps, but I think this is going to be the best. I'm considering whether or not to upgrade. Right now I am just using the free envelopes to track my problem areas."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have used this for several years and it has been the only way we've consistently budgeted. We love that it syncs between our phones so each of us always know where we stand with our expenses. The free version is sufficient for simple budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget (formerly EEBA) is hands down the best envelope style money management tool out there. and best of all it's free for most use cases (20 envelopes and 2 devices, not counting unlimited computers)  get it you won't regret it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Since I have to enter all transactions manually, this app has made me very conscious of how I'm spending. It has really helped my husband and I get on the same page with our budget. I agree with other reviewers that I would absolutely pay for this app if it were a one time buy, but I don't care for the subscription model. That is the only reason I gave this app 4 stars and not 5. Also, it was much easier to set up envelopes on the website rather than the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its a simple concept- that you have envelopes with money for various things. It's quick and easy to use, only gripe is that it can't seem to sync with the website (probably wouldn't take the time to do the website thing anyway), and if you put money in your envelopes and then mess up (like fill twice or too early), it's not easy to unfill them individually and change around. So I've had to completely restart the whole process from the beginning a few times."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what it should."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Free version u can only have 10 envelopes but works fine"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple. Useful. Create account and it becomes amazing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is invaluable to me now! I have various bills that come out of my account all the way through the month so I find it hard to know how much of the money in my account is available to spend and how much needs to be kept back for bills.  With the simple envelope system, I can split my monthly wage into different categories and set up all my monthly bills to go out automatically. This leaves me to see at a glance how much I've got left for buying lunch or little luxuries. I can record those on the go and everything stays up to date Brilliant!  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because scheduled payments clear automatically on Pacific Time which means it doesn't happen at midnight for me in the UK like it ought to. Add a timezone setting for the Household and this gets a full 5 stars!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I love this app, but the cost to get more than 10 envelopes is ridiculous, thus making the app's practicality, useless. As others have said, this should be a one time fee. Add in ads to the free version if you need to, but don't ask for a reoccurring $5 a month fee. That's kinda contradictive for a budgeting app... As I'd have to make a ""Goodbudget"" envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Yay"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps keep the budget on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I started many years ago with the envelope system.  I created my own way of doing it without the physical envelopes but it was very time consuming.   I was so happy to find goodbudget!  So easy to use and I love how my husband can help with his own app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has totally turned our financial situation around. I have tried budgeting on my own, but was never successful. Instead of going to my banks website to see my balance and figuring our how much is available, or searching for my budget notebook, I open the app and I can see exactly how much money we have for what. This totally exceeded my expectations!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best app of its kind!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Was a great app to replace my cash envelopes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Very easy to use, not complicated at all."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for two years now and it really helps you to get a handle on your family budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I'm like the way it encourages you whenever you add transactions, the way it calculates your rate of spending and suggests how long to slow spending down for. It also tells you when your ahead which intices you to try harder to save. Cool app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use the free version. Love that we can use on both our phones and we can stay synched. Has really helped us start a budget and see where our money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Trying to use this app again.  Can't get anything set up without a computer.  So, I can't do this and that and anything else on the app itself."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Is really helping my family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app... Very simple to use after playing with it a bit. Works perfectly. I've never experienced a glitch."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"All I need was a simple app to keep track of my money from paycheck to paycheck. This does it very well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It allows me to easily budget. I now tell my money where to go and each month I can see how much I have to spend. I also like the new addition of annual envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"There are many reasons to like it.  But I think I'm going to switch to an app that automatically pulls the data from my bank account so I don't have to enter the data manually.  My biggest issue is the price. I don't mind paying for an app but $5 a month is too much for what it does.  Many would complain about paying that much for their checking account.  Let alone an app that just tracks spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"2 limited!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but I use the free version because I would rather pay once than the subscription method used.  It's killing it for me, and I am actively looking for a replacement although the app is everything I really want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and understand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just what I was looking for.....With out using something like quicken."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me out of trouble with the book keeper (wife). Syncs to both of our phones so we always know how much we have. Never overdraw this way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to keep track of incoming and outgoing money!  Very easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps us stay on track financially. You can tell a lot of work and thought have gone into it. The app more than pays for itself. For a few dollars a month you get a tool that can help you save hundreds and truly understand your finances at all times... It's a no brainer.   We need to support more apps like this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A bit of work to set up but so far has been easy to use and working well for us.  It's quick to add a purchase as long as we remember to do it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing financial management tool. I use this one and Spendee, and find both of them extremely useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tryed evwry other app n this is the only one that let two people use the same acct for free"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget helps me manage my monthly budget pretty easily.  Apart from what it does, I love those short feedback messages.  Thanks a lot"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Seems easy to use and keep track of where we're at. Been looking for something like this for a while"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is great for helping me to budget my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not anything fancy but it suits my needs and I like that you can sync between two devices.  I don't need a lot of bells and whistles, I just want a simple budget app.  I wish you could set up more than 10 envelopes.  I was planning on doing a purchase in order to get more envelopes but I was expecting a 1 time purchase...looks like my only option is a subscription plan of $5/month.  Lame.  I'd rather do a one time purchase to get additional envelopes.  Looking for a new app that allows for that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like the overall system (online, app and sync) but the app needs some work to make it look and function like the website. The website is more intuitive and offers functionality that is not available on the app as far as I can tell (scheduled transactions, reports, the way income is handled). For $5 a month I would like better app functionality. I am looking forward to being able to choose the budget frequency of each envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app we have found."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Pretty good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's pricy for subscription and if you have a household full of expenses you'll need more envelopes.  If you're just getting started it looks good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We started budgeting with the envelope system and this is working pretty well so far too keep track. It would be good to have an easy way to differentiate cash vs card as it's hard to know how much cash I can take from the account vs leave it for the credit card withdrawal. Also it's hard to know my wife's vs my expenses. Otherwise is good :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use.   Good number of free features."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I now feel like  im in control of my money. This app has made me accountable for my spending and helped me set and acheive some financial goals. Took some time to figure out at first but was well worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does what it says, is relatively easy to use, if I need more functions in the future/ more envelopes this is an app I would pay for to upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great to keep you and spouse on budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Downloaded app, created all my envelopes, then it said it couldn't sync online even though I've got full signal on my phone.  Then when I try to do ANYTHING it crashes.  After doing this many times and essentially not letting me do anything I Uninstalled  and am looking for an app that will work.  Galaxy S5 active on AT&T"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"""Free"" app has limited envelopes,only 10, otherwise you have to purchase.  thanks for wasting my time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would give 5 states if I could take a picture of the receipts to include with keeping track of expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"And does it well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does what I need it to do"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"As long as you have a basic budget (no investment income so to speak or things like that) this is a great way to keep track of expenses and income"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It's stupid and spams ur email"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has the functions I was looking for, though it has a bit of a learning curve for me. It's a friendly little app, giving me positive affirmations to help motivate me !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up and use. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app lets my husband and I keep track of our budget while I'm at home and he's on the road for work. Easy to use, easy to make adjustments. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,":)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it!  I've been using this tool for years and it's my favorite"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for years.  Support has been great when I needed it.  Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you can stick to the system, this app is awesome!  I wouldn't change a thing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This program has been a wonderful tool!  We use it daily. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great, super easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I don't want my finances to be on their website.  Too bad,  could be a good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A great app for the disciples of envelope budgeting. This app lets you know when you're going over budget and comes with a handy calculator. It's also good that you can note all the things you spend money on.. This makes you reconsider what you buy when you can see it in print versus traditional envelope budgeting where you spend blindly til the allotted money finishes. However, you have to remember to input your expenses and inflows or it's useless."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need it to."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's handy & reliable, a good tool to track your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really help my family budgeting problem..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great upgrade from paper envelopes that only one person can have with them at a time. This has really helped us to keep track of things and feel hopeful about paying off debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Really helps me keep on track. I had a similar system in a spreadsheet on my computer but it's so much easier having it on my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app to keep track of a budget. Using a zero based budget is allowing me to tell my money where to go. I live on a variable  income so fill envolopes weekly, wish after spending filled envolopes there could be a paid stamp or symbol, instead of checking transactions for each envolope. Also while filling envolopes the menu should show you current balances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app.   Keeps the finances in check and full view at all times."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Superbe it changed my life!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"My wife and I tried to register on this app at least 30 times with two different mobiles. The app comes up with some excuse or the other. Sometimes we already have an account by that name. Sometimes this account already exists. Sometimes there is a network error. Didn't let us register at all."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Now we can use the envelope method with our bank cards."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and fast to update and modify!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried several other budgeting apps out there...many require you to link to your bank account which is not necessary.  The virtual envelopes are the key. Dave Ramsey would be proud of you developers!  Unfortunately, $45/year is way too much for what you get beyond the free version. Maybe if it was a one-time fee it'd be worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love that multiple users can live time use it simultaneously"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what we needed for our household budget. The synching between users is great. Simple and intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,".."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"A waste of my time! could only get 3 envelopes groceries, gas, savings. And when I try to put my grocery bill in it added to my account instead of subtracting from my balance period not what I'm looking for period"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like it. I wish you could update more on the phone versus having to use the computer. It definitely makes me more aware of where my paycheck goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I love that my husband and I can share this app and it syncs on the fly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use been using it for a year"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Its the best budgeting app I've came across. I like how it doesn't connect to your bank accounts. Those tend to be so complicated and glitchy, giving you false information, which enables you to spend what money you don't have, but are told you do have. This app took me a little getting used to, but I was good after a week or so. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great app. Just what I need. But I'm getting quite frustrated that I can't set envelopes to fill properly each week. It seems more complex than it needs to be :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"There is a monthly fee. Free version had limited envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"In a paid subscription, what happened to those budgets beyond 10 limit if I couldn't be able to pay the next subscription?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Like statistic, spending trend etc. Also monthly bill payment should be locked away with a simple tap once it's filled to discourage transfer bill money. Many little things could be improved upon this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you stay within a budget.  I tried Mint multiple times but it always had issues and errors.  The concept of syncing with your accounts and providing some level of automation seems great, but it never worked.  I have actually found that having to enter my transactions helps me keep better tabs on how well I am filling my busget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use this to track my receipts and budget monthly. I wish when you went back through transactions that it didn't automatically take you back to the most recent bc that it's irritating for budgeting later. Also, I would like it to auto refill at the beginning of the month. Otherwise I really like it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful and fairly simple once you've set it up and worked it out. Keeps me on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Requires a GoodBudget ac!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very effective for tracking spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you keep track of your expenses, this is a great app to help you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of my spending.  Love that you can split your budget into different spending categories.   And I always have it with me so I update it as soon as I leave the store, which is a good habit to get into!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Little hard to get used to at first, but once you get the hang of it its the best of its kind!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works as a checkbook register, too"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for my Bi-Weekly budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great when I remember to use it. Easy to use nice and simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its so easy to use and very appealing.  Love love love it. Way better than having envelopes around which really is the best way to keep up with finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is such a great app for me. Simple and effective. If you just want a way to keep track of spending without bank integration its perfect. 1/29/15 - still the best way to maintain a budget. Five stars again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"doesn't fit more than 8 envelopes on the screen!! so I couldn't continue with my whole budget.  interface really cool but pathetic app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I liked this app. It reminds me of an electronic version of Dave Ramseys fpu. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is isn't as user friendly as I thought it should be. I would like to see a video showing some of the features of the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Started off amazing. Logged out and lost all information. Refuses to sync. Pretty butt hurt about it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for creating a budget. It allows you to open your budget in the store and check how much you have left in your categories so you don't overspend. Works flawlessly on the galaxy S5."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Wasted time installing and setting up, to be told that more than ten outgoings requires a monthly subscription of stupid amounts of money. Waste of my time and anyone else's."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been able to work this in seamlessly with our fpu efforts. Our kids are even getting into it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My husband and I have only been using this app for 2 months, but there has been significant improvement in the way we spend our money. It is really eye-opening to see how much we spend on certain items. Great app for keeping track of spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great in conjunction with Dave Ramseys budget planning software"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's easy to master and use, and it's been helping me keep a close eye on my budget (I'm on a grad student budget) for two years now. Occasionally it does mess something up, but overall, it's a solid app. Just remember to record everything! It's a good habit to get into."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I wish to get the total expenses calculation and allowing to add more source of income like through investment.plz tel whether the salary value should be given before or after tax deduction. We should be allowed to enter yearly income. **Please explain calculation of left over amount under the label available**"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried free version for 3 months, the upgraded to paid version, additional functionality is well worth it. We have been looking for a tool like this for years to track and budget where the money goes. It is very handy with the app on the phone and detailed view on the computer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great job with the update...works well!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love how this app sincs to three devices and allows my husband and I to stay on the same page with our budget. Highly recommend this app because it's simular to the envelop system and gives you a gauge to follow so you don't overspend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This made keeping the family budget possible.  This has made managing our funds much easier.  Thinking about subscribing to unlimited envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Now we have our budget on track the way we want it to be. It has individual envelopes to categorize our expenses. My husband and I can add our transactions at any given time and all information are sync in website at the same time! Plus the app interface is friendly and well created. All the help and support is also provided. We definitely recommend this budgeting app. To all the developers, thank you for sharing your talent and time. Great job and God bless!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple.  Pretty intuitive.  I would love to pay you for the app...a one time payment...even if it were a little more costly than others.  I like it that much.   However...for it it to be a yearly commitment is ridiculous.   Someone else can -and eventually will-develop something that can replace this for a one w time purchase.    I wish it were you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use its great!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using this for a year or two, it's very intuitive and a great way to keep track of expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I am a fairly tech savvy individual,  but this app is missing some key information. Once you put in your income and fill you envelopes then what? I saved my financials several times and still could not tell what was expected next or how to proceed.  I am not sure if this is the app for me. #uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really practical and easy to use. Not perfect as refilling envelopes can lead to an unexpected surplus but that doesn't stop the app being a highly effective budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budgeting program"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Have been using this for over a year.  It's easy and love the multi user function."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just needs to ability to separate weekly and monthly envelopes. I love it otherwise, helping save over 10 percent of my income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday. Keeps my husband and I on the same page and helps us live within a budget. Love it! Thanks goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Well done ... It keeps the user on the track.. i strongly recommend it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I figured how to set up and running after spending a lot of time with the app... Started using online and after you set up... It's not so easy to make changes/edits."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Took me a minute to figure it out though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"How do you follow the envelope system when carrying a debit card has become the norm? GoodBudget! Set up electronic envelopes, put money in and log the spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's too complicated to understand the layout. I like when it's made easy to budget expenses, I could hardly understand how to operate around this app. I'm not knocking it, because it may work for the next person."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the easiest budgets I've ever worked with. Detailed oriented and encouraging to the user. I must add on that taxes are easier thanks to this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use.  Very helpful for keeping me on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it daily to keep track of our budget!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Much responsible knowing where any money is going and how it's being spent, plan on saving a lot more"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great budgeting tool and simple to use. Helps to keep me on track each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having this app on our phones has helped us track better as a couple. Highly recommended for couples who are working on being budget conscious and working together."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me ahead of the game!! Love it and so does my wallet! :) $$$"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Had potential but is just a way to make you spend your money to buy their ""FREE APP""."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app. Does mostly all I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the envelope system. Wooks awesome for us. We don't keep track of fixed expenses just variable ones and we find this program works great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Put all yout expenses in this. Easy to keep up with"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the app but compared to the website completing some tasks can be confusing or impossible. Like refilling your main account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"A little complicated  for me after  the first month of use. First month of use was very straightforward"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I used this app several years ago to help us save money and pay off a lot of debt. We've floundered a bit in the last year and so have returned to this app to get us back on track. I'm a bit disappointed that much of the website functionality hasn't made it to the app, even after 2 years. I would love to be able to see my sub groupings on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It's complicated to use. I put incomes in unallocated because it's easier than putting them in paycheck. Filling envelopes is very difficult to do through the app so I have to do it through the website. I only look at the app to take a gander at how much I have to spend. It would be easier to use if I can input my checks and fill envelopes without crazy incorrect calculations occurring. The HELP info isn't helpful and I'm looking for an easier app so I can uninstall"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app really helped us finacially. It took a little time to calculate a budget that worked for us, but once we set it up and started tracking, it has been awesome. No more of ""too much month at the end of the money"". We know exactly where we are every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great for fans of Dave Ramsey and the envelope budgeting system. Been using it for years. The best feature is it syncs between devices so my wife and I can record our transactions in the same place and view balances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has helped alot. I use about ten envelopes. Freeeeee"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only 10 envelopes I have way more monthly payments than 10.  Will not pay 5 dollars a month seems like wasted money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great for keeping your budget on you wherever you go. It allows you to add every expense right then and there. Makes it difficult to forget that you bought lunch yesterday or got a small from the machine. As long as you put it in your budget, then there's no harm, no foul."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Friggan awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You become quite surprised where your money goes when you track it like this. Helped with frivolous spending. Would love to see Android Wear be integrated at some point."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely helps me keep track of my spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is the easiest budget app to use that I have found. Works great and really helps you save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful and super easy. My husband and I have been using it for years.  It's helped us keep track of where everything goes, from small ""oh, it doesn't matter"" purchases that add up to larger expenses. Best thing is looking at that green bar and not feeling guilty anymore."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Cannot find a way to change home currency. It also doesn't have multiple currency features. I might have to stick with Toshl."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to keep track of a budget! Very happy with all the fixes and abilities."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of small everyday  expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good for being able to see what your spending and where, but it would be nice if you go over your budget in a certain area you could have the ability at the end of the month to reset to zero to refill easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Perfect app to combine with the website, but it should be completed with all features!  - I didn't see how to put incomes... - all graphics are not on the smartphone reachable...  and I have some ideas of features that could be useful for myself ;-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to stay organized!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I are into our second month using this app. It's simple to use and keeps us in track! My only suggestion would be a count down until the next envelope fill."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you learn how to fill the envelopes and enter transactions it is Great! It is really helping us stay on track so we can pay debt off faster."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for free for a year. Trying subscription now. P.S. Subscription absolutely worth it. Great idea and great app for it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm not an organized person, but Good Budget has helped me organize my finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helped me organize and and keep track off my budget. Definitely recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is my favorite app! It has allowed my husband and I to take control of our money and we have saved so much in the process! I love that we can sync devices and how easy it is to use. Plus the envelope is adorable. Thank you, Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its really good, they just need to make it a little more idiot proof, sometimes I find it hard to find some of the options that should be easy to find."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"App is great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Im trying to save money by budgeting not spend more by paying monthly for this app. There are other good free apps out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fast. Easy to use. Flexible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have found Goodbudget to be easy to use and very helpful in the development and management of our family's budget. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes me excited to budget. Usually I am not."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use it all the time top app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does all what you expect. Takes a bit to learn how  to use it smoothly. Handling of how the envelopes are filled could have been a  bit easier though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it too"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best and easiest budgeting app (and webpage) I've ever used!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless to me. Can only do 10 envelopes for weekly outgoings. Will be deleting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"As long as I track, it helps me big time. Great for making a plan and sticking to it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Приложение самое лучшее из всех но сложно сориентироваться что куда добавлять."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have long dreamed for such an app. so happy to use it. changes your life."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app ever! Helping keep our marriage intact. A lot fewer fights about money. A superb budgeting/ envelope tool for Dave Ramsey Financial Peace plan when we didn't want to carry cash but instead wanted to use only debit card purchases."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Like the concept. Refilling the envelopes is confusing process. Not sure if everything automatically restarts on the first of every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is my 2nd year using this app & I'm more than satisfied so far and highly recommend if you budget using envelopes.  The power is in data access across many platforms when connected to the Internet."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and keeps up with everything. Even the free option has enough envelopes to cover all my needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app/budget program on my devices and through the website for the past few years. It has really helped me to learn how to use my money correctly and how to spend only what I have designated for different things (most of the time). I purchased the ""accounts"" vesion once and didn't really like it, but I also didn't use it much. I definitely recommend Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what i need it to do"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well and has so many great features"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, very intuitive. Easy to use with multiple people"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Like the app so far but I haven't been able to sync to the servers for 2 days."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Budget and expenses simply tracked"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Seems cool, but tried to redo my income and now I can't....there's no option for adding income...if so, how is it done?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hard to use. Maybe it's me but I can figure other apps - just not this one."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great way to track expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used this app with multiple androids and iPhones for over for years and it has functioned as expected without flaw. This app has allowed my family to create an envelope budgeting system that syncs to show any user what is remaining in each folder. Great tool!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good for basic and quick budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this app to budget my money and its wonderful use it all the time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Installed this and have easily figured out. Love it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I struggle with sticking to my budget but this helps me get a visual of how I spend my money!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using Goodbudget for more than 3 years now and it fits exactly my needs to manage my monthly expenses, keep track of my budget and easily record my daily operations. I'm using the paid version and always I need any help, the support team is really responsive and provide valuable inputs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Looking for simple things like the ability to set up reoccurring transactions so I don't have to add them manually. And need better categories beyond just the envelopes so I have a better way to break down the summary."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it every day and it has helped us tremendously. Thanks for providing such a great product!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for envelope system budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely helps keep the budget in line."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Please add a checkbox feature in transactions so I can reconcile my entries with my bank account! I can't link the app with my bank account. This addition would change my rating to 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great for tracking spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has sorted family budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love using these virtual envelopes to track my spending.  Real cash envelopes were a constant headache.  My husband and I can work together better with this app too.  The web interface makes regular budget checkups a cinch."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Hate the color scheme"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. It helps to save money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best expense tracking system I have come across"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just got started with the first ten free envelopes and it is helping me to keep a better budget than my bank statements were doing.  I will have to re-rate this app in a few months  and tell you all how it is working"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"V useful tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Only way to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best so far"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife & I have used the free version for years.  It works for the same reasons your grandmother's envelope system worked.  It's effective because it's straightforward & accessible.  Better than physical envelopes because everyone has access to them all the time, not just the person holding the envelopes full of cash!  Goodbudget has been good for our budget...even back when it was called EEBA 😁"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years across several phones.  Best way to keep things synced for our entire family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful. Great for families since it allows synchronization. Exporting to text files is buggy, some reporting functions too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simply superb fr budgeting and home expense tracking. Have tried workin with many apps so far - this is the best. And web-mobile app combo is another big winner fr me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It's an ok concept but I can never fill envelopes from the app it makes me do it online. Ehhh"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I thought I'd try this app.  The free version won't let me edit any of the envelopes or change my payroll amounts.  Useless."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It wouldn't update my edits. Continually reroute me to login screen with incorrect info, even though I hit save. I AM VERY FRUSTRATED."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app very easy to use and can be shared by multiple family members. A couple of bugs when filling envelopes but nothing that can't be worked around easily."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to learn and easy to use. Exactly how I like to organise my money! This app keeps me afloat!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Free version useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps me to manage my money. I don't use it religiously to record every purchase, but the different envelopes for various types of transaction, such as shopping or travel, really helps me keep tabs on how much money I have to spend. A big thumbs up!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I can sync with my husband's phone, so I know we are always on the same page as far as our budget goes! Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Free version is stable and doesn't hog resources on my Android. Recent updates have made splitting and editting transactions easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"tried some other apps, sticked with this one, because it's fast, and has a web interface with detailed statistics. subscribed for pro account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having trouble entering the paycheck details sometimes.. make it more visible maybe?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what I have been looking for in terms of a budgeting with a virtual envelope system. No need to carry cash, just check your virtual envelopes. It is great to see how the money in our banking account is allocated. Definitely recommend this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome for keeping track of finances(its also free)! No problems ever, and its consistently updated!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app and very helpful to create and maintain a budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. It has worked beautifully without any trouble. Keeps data seamlessly synchronised between mobile & website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love using this app to track our everyday spending. Easy and reliable!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"In general I like how quick and easy this app is. The sync feature is awesome for keeping the wife and I on the same page. My only complaint is how the 'split into multiple envelopes' feature works. I don't know what the answer is but it's just not that intuitive, especially when you need to delete a category that you entered incorrectly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Trying it out. A little complicates at first but stick with it and read the tutorial. It could be very helpful setting up a budget over time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've had this before on a previous phone, but I can't find the one you pay for (which I had). 10 envelopes is not enough!! I need the other. Help?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budget is simple and easy and keeps me on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has transformed our family finances. It's great to be able to quickly check envelope balances and enter expenses on the go."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget application"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The wife and I have been using it for several years.  Works well, not complicated, and it's easy to input transactions on the go. I suggest starting with the free version and not as many envelopes, then upgrading and adding categories for better spending insights."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Can it be the app for budgetting as a high school student?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wife and I use this.  Easy to use after learning its functions.  Helps us stay on track every month especially in personal spending habits."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Fantastic interface for envelyope style budgeting.  Works great.  The setup and interface takes a little getting used to and allocating cash to your envelopes can be tricky unless you use the online service (completely free).   This app has helped me keep my finances in check and has saved me a ton of money.  Thumbs up!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Using this was so straightforward! My husband and I tried so many other apps including some that were a part of an expensive desktop program. This has been the most flexible, we can budget weekly, biweekly and so on."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget is exactly what we've needed. We've searched for an efficient way to keep track of our finances, and this is perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Totally changed the way I deal with money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does just as it says. I haven't quite mastered filling the envelopes but I assume that's user error. Our family will likely upgrade to the paid version because we find it so helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very well created app.  Really enjoy the layout and the functionality!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent budget tracker!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how easy it is to use.  You can go online or change things from the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love how it links to my husband's phone. We just can't figure out how to start a month at our pay period."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Update: they worked with me until my issue was resolved. Wonderful app with a wonderful development team!!!!                                                             Original comment: The only thing I don't like is that I have to go on the website to delete a transaction. Otherwise,  it is wonderful and had definitely helped my hubby and I be getter stewards of God's money."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app for people who hate budgeting. As simple or as detailed as you wanna make it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a year now, helps me stay on budget immensely."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really awesome and simple to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great concept.  Was able to take a screen shot of what I had done and delete and re download.  It works fine now. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"My app won't sync to the server so can't get it on pc and edit envelopes. Would like to be able to edit envelopes on app too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This works so well to keep family on same page with where money is going, etc. Helpful displays and plenty of categories. So thankful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Comitting yourself to using this app really is one of the great decisions that you can make in life, as an individual and/or as a household. Do it!!!  Goodbudget enabled me to finally start maintaining a budget. The app is not perfect though, but you can participate in the consumer satisfaction website they have and actually influence the course of development, if others have the same complaints and suggestions. There is no portrait orientation support, which is a minus for tablet use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use the app daily.  It really helps us to keep track of our finances and easily communicate about the in and out of our daily expenses."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well and helps me stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I only use it for budgeting, not for tracking my finances, but this is great for listing all of my budgets which I reset at the beginning of the month and track my expenses as they happen. The only thing better would be if I could scan my receipt total and have it auto populate a few fields."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An excellent app that has made keeping track of my money easy and convenient. Easy to use with great features. Customer support seems to be excellent looking at comments in the app store and forums on the site. Excellent product full 5 start rating from me, keep up the good work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been fairly seemless and very easy to use on multiple android devices as well as on the web."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app...really helps keep everything organized!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use it every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"App goes well with Dave Ramseys finance book/tips (I dont buy into everything from the course, but I like snippets of it). App def helps our family manage money better"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What you get in the free version is is good enough to do any normal household budget. I use it every day! The only thing I can suggest to add is something to organize things charged to different credit cards and some place to mark off when the transaction posts. Thank you for a great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good functionality, poor design"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Dave Ramsey friendly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app if you know how to budget. Helped me buy a house"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works as advertised"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It has really been helping my wife and I keep track of our expenses since we got married. But, I wish we didn't have to keep track of them manually. . . I wish that Goodbudget would somehow connect directly to our bank accounts and record our expenses automatically."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I finally have found something that keeps us on track. Easy and fun to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Handy, simple"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like knowing exactly where the money is going and it is very freeing to be able to look and know the money is there to buy that cute shirt and not be guessing and feeling guilty about it. Sometimes the multiple categories option freezes and you can't correctly enter your receipt until you get home and can do it on the computer, but that is really only if you have more than 2 categories on a receipt, which isn't often."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am not the best with budgeting,  but after 6 months with this app I am proud to say I am not only caught up with my bills,  I have savings!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It doesn't have a lot of features but what it has, it does best. Simple, fast and reliable!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday makes budgeting super easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app and it's awesome that it syncs with my husbands phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps organize those who want to be organized! Wish it was totally free!! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have tried a couple dozen different apps and systems and this is by far the most flexible and easy to understand. Great for families who want to keep on track together. Concepts are easy to understand, sync works really well, reports are helpful, the data is open so it's easy to import, export and backup your data and best (and most importantly) of all, the dev team is very active, always engaging their users and adding new and exciting features, fixing bugs, and generally being awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Definitely an awesome budgeting app. Simple and easy to use. Easy to sinc across devices and works seamlessly. I'd be more than willing to support this app by getting the full version, but the cost is ridiculous! A monthly fee for almost  no extra features, I'll use the perfectly good trial version thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful for envelope budgeting with auto payment feature and accessibility on multiple mobile devices. Would be greater if have net worth tracking on the same platform!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect. Thanks for a flawless app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app mostly because for the first time I have found a budgeting app that I keep up to date and use regularly. It's just what I needed and nothing more. That's a good thing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app. Was easy to use but I don't like being able to just budget Monthly or weekly or biweekly. I budget weekly but most bills I pay monthly and I can't figure out how to do that on this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the great tutorial online.   This seems like a great little app.   Can't wait to get started."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't open on my android. Getting notification that goodbudget has stopped working. Tried turning phone off.  Have used for two years and has never happened before"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Needs additional envelope options (monthly AND every 2wks AND every 4wks etc). I think I read you're working on this,  and the sooner the better. Plus you really need to make pending transactions viewable in the app,  not just online. To be able to see my acct balance and plan ahead I in the app I have to manually enter the transactions online then adjust the date to the correct future date."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Great idea but my month never started new on the 1st even though it was set to it. I have had the app for 2 months and it still says I am in month 1 (so basically saying I am over budget). It's a little confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Account balance keeps going negative even if i had deleted every transaction. No way to even set a starting amount for it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I never thought would be so easy to organize my budget. I just miss a place to put expenses that i have to pay in multiple months"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Why do some apps feel the need to force you to enter a payee?? I know what I'm spending it on if its grocery's then that's all I need to know I don't need to know what store it was at. Fix this"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"How can I change decimal numbers to three digits.bcuz I am living in Sultanate of Oman and we  are using 3decimal s.....eg: 1.000,"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Would've liked more capability in mobile version (so different from web) but no deal breaker. Support is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Since using this app it was the first time i have been diligent with recording my spending and sticking to a budget. Easy to use. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for a active couple trying to stay within budget amount"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Needed an app that syncs between two phones,  doesn't make us add our bank account,  and let's us do an envelope system without cash!   Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Working well again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My daughter recommended it and my husband and I have been using it about 6 weeks now. It is easy to use once the money is in the envelopes, but I feel like the procedure to get them filled is a bit tricky. It may be just me...once I have that set in my mind more firmly, it will be great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep on top of my budget. A great tool to have with me at all times"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Hard to figure out how to correctly redo each month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have used various versions of quicken, ynab, and other budgeting tools. This is my very favorite. Its so easy and helps me really save money! I have had a few troubles with it not opening on my phone, however."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps out a lot.  Never budgeted before and this helped me get back on track with my finances.  Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This really helps me budget. Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope systems are great, dealing with cash that's at home when you pick up a bottle of milk on the way home from work isn't. Goodbudget has made sticking to our budget much easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Updated (12/1/2014): Although the web app is still WAY better than the mobile app, at least it finally got a much needed facelift and the syncing issues have been fixed. 3 stars until mobile app and web app are equally good AND if you can find a way to incorporate installment payments. Otherwise, the app really helps you budget your money.  --- Since it became Goodbudget, it's awful. Can't sync from my smartphone at all. Outdated Android UI."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"wish they would add an auto recurring deposit, auto fill and a % fill features but still love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"unnessesair complicate for use 😐"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Indispensable!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very handy and a LOT easier to use than some others I've tried.  Would give it 5 stars if there was a way to see on an envelope that was partially filled, then emptied, how much is left in the budget for the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Food budget planning tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the first tool I have used to help budget.  I have had no issues with it whatsoever, and it works great for helping me realize how much money I spend per month. That realization, in turn, helps me save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used several budget tools and this is by far the best.  It is simple and easy to use.  It makes budgeting fun and effective!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy set up, but applying my paycheck and filling envelopes is sometimes confusing. I like how I can see where I over spend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I began to use the app and it has been very useful for my personal monthly finance, great and easy envelope management system. My only concern is regarding the UI, the colors, buttons and navigation can be improved and be well deserved for the money paid. Having a better UI, will deserve 5 and more stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little confusing getting set up but easy to use once I got going."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Basic use is free with NO ads.  Syncs across the android, ios, and web.  Has worked excellent on my Moto X."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting tool. Very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Our family uses it all the time, New interface is much more intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Envelopes are simple.  Goodbudget is not.  I don't need you to track checking account balances.  I don't need you to know what I spent $4.53 on.  I don't need to tell you which account i pulled the virtual $100 from.  I just need you to track the balance in an envelope.  Pretty simple concept, overly complicated implementation."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Easy enough to understand and use, but it just kept hanging, which was really annoying :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This app didn't work for my needs as it only gives you a limited amount of storage and envelopes. I would have to pay for more."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I love this app but seriously for the past couple days i have not been able to open it and it keeps forcing close!! This is maddening!! Please fix, i use an LG G2."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is so simple and the online usage from my tablet is awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly for my situation. Was living paycheck to paycheck, but good budget has helped me catch up and start saving."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app has been extremely easy to use so far. My only complaint is that you can't fill envelopes from your phone!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The payment for more folders is a little over the top.  You may be pricing yourself out of the market.  It just forced us to consolidate budget items.  Good app though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Does not sync to bank accounts. I really like the layout but I don't want to have to upload my transactions each time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is the best solution for family budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you read how to use, this is great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Had a hard time creating and when i did it didnt seem to work out.  Maybe i just understand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I can stay on budget all month and never wonder what we have left in each category."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So useful and really helping me manage my money. Where has this been all my life?!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app but can't register, all the names are taken"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful and easy to use. No problems"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The setup was really clunky so I mark it down... But it's worth persevering and once it's running it's a lifesaver"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have this syncing across my iphone, andoid tablet, and wife's phone.  Amazing app and its free!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This thing helps my wife and I stay on the same page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!A very handy one."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have used this for years now. It is really perfect for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good mobile companion to web site"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No more trips to bank for cash"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Nothing wrong with the app, no bugs so far what so ever. The fact that it allows so little 'envelopes' (accounts) and syncing with only two devices for the free version, is a shame. And the paid version is way too expensive for a handy app. If you really want to have a paid version, make it very affordable. And when I mean affordable, I mean not having to think twice for the purchase.  Allow more envelopes and more devices for the free version, if you would like to gain more users. Just my thought."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Its simple enough after you play around in the settings a bit. but I  havent been able to get it to sync in a weeeek"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sorts your finances out, easily. Stops you from wasting lots of money on random things. Really helpful to stay on track with your budget and savings goals. I wholeheartedly recommend this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great customer  support!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I don't need this app if I have to create an account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps is stay on track in the digital age using the idea of the old fashioned envelop system but I can use cash, check, debit or charge card!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Update: Great tech support. Responded to my issues within 24 hours and found the solution.  Like the concept of the app. But for some reason it won't update my revised amounts.  Making it look like I'm in the negatives and it won't sync to the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It makes tracking your expenses and income a breeze!  I used it for the entire month of October and I know exactly what I spent. I'm no longer afraid of budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its easy and convenient. No issues so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, helps me visualize my purchases. Still trying to figure out the cssh flow from end of month to start of month. Not sure how/where the surplus is accounted for. But for simple expense tracking its great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, effective and bug free"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my family and I up on what we do, and don't, have to spend. Makes budgeting so easy, and filling up the wallets after every paycheck - a breeze. Super fast syncing and all family mementos can use, and view, the app updated at once = A+++. Highly recommended for family use (and peace of mind)!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I consider myself quite savvy with technology. Yet this app is so confusing. I cannot even complete a task as simple as setting monthly income. Very very confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get the hang of using the system you'll be hooked."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well. Tough to make entries where you make money though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really like this app, what I've been looking for, but the apps version is limited like i have to log in to web to edit...thats not very convenient, and I cant change my account date.  I just downloaded the apps but I cant manage my current budget because I cant insert my oct salary."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get past the initial envelope fill, the app is so quick and easy.  Love the way it syncs immediately.  Makes it so easy to stay on top of debit card purchases, too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app that allows my wife and I to track a budget to the dollar :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for months now, and I find the simplicity to be a huge plus! Having a manual approach to budgeting is why I love this app so much."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like the sync feature so my wife and I instantly know when an account has been used and what the balance is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"we have Loved using this app ! ! ! !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple but powerful, it has helped me organize what was previously a less formal effort. The fact that it synchronizes across multiple devices is a winning feature - my wife and I are always on the same page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once in a while someone makes a program that is just what it should be. No more, no less; just a streamlined, purpose built program. Good Budget is a prime example of this. Now that I've used it, I feel guilty for getting such a good app for free. My wife and I can now easily keep track of things between us without the need to collect receipts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Only 3 envelopes are given and it doesn't have the feature to add more envelopes. Otherwise application is very good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting easy! Thanks for making this app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using it for almost 2 years now.  Just to show you how consistent it has been for us.  Our needs are changing so we may move to the paid version.  This app has been incredible in helping our family stay on budget.  I love the simplicity of the format, where you don't have to sync a bunch of accounts, you just add the purchases manually.  Incredibly simple but it will change the way you live if you stick to your budget.  And I also love being able to sync on all our devices.  So convenient."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A great app for managing the household budget. Syncs perfectly between Android and iPhone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helped us with our budgeting and keeping tabs on our spending! Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. My wife and I have it on each of our phones and when we walk out of the grocery store, we go on the app, take 3 seconds to enter the receipt and it instantaneously updates the other. Awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Would have been great if it had synced. But after days of trying, it jus would not. So useless."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It deleted all the envelopes I had created. Otherwise it would have been great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Im a ynab user who is frustrated at the fact that i can only shuffle my allocated budget around from my computer at home. The moment i receive my pay, my pay is already distributed into different accnts and etc. Yet, i cant budget what i have till i go home. Good budget works similarly along the same lines as ynab. But i can access it anywhere with internet and i csn transfer between envelopes on my android. Im switching over to goodbudget!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesomely useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wish I would have had this earlier. It would have saved me allot of time and heartache. Just wish I could add my savings account to the free edition."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app offers a lot of functionality for free and even more capacity for a subscription! I love the free version. My only issue is sometimes doing stuff in the app isn't as intuitive as I'd like."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wish I had something like this year's ago.  This has really helped us budget properly.  It's simple & easy to use.  Love it :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Kept saying I already had an account no matter what email I used. Have definitely never used this app before. Very strange."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really appreciated the recent changes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So convenient to use on my tablet, very quick to learn and set up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of your spending, especially when you can sync with your partner's phone. I've recommended it to loads of friends."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's great! Super easy to use, lots of envelopes for free(just need a couple more, but I make it work). It's sinked with my husband's app and our tablet.  So every one is aware what's going on. Dave Ramsey should be proud:)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Grocery Envelope is not subtracting when I add a Grocery transaction.  How do I get it to work?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This is very overpriced ($45/year!) given what it is capable of. Envelope budgeting with no subcategories - so, a lot of scrolling to get an overview. But the most serious limitation for me is that you are only every operating in the current month. Sure, you can set envelopes to refresh come the end of each month, but there's no ability to set budgets ahead of time, to say,  pre-allocate a pot of money for Christmas shopping come November.  The developers do seem responsive and there's a complementary website, but it's hard to see how this app could seriously help anyone's financial management beyond the most basic logging of day to day expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Just downloaded.  Been looking for budget app for a while now.   This app has great reviews.   I tried setting up with email but says already registered....   And let me tell you my email is unique with a made up word.....   I tried"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Just added the app. I was sold with all the awesome reviews. Have high expectations. Only gave a 3 so far because I haven't tested it out long enough... I've had it a few months now. It's pretty good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly the app I've been looking for!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It does perfectly, what it says"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I both use it, and we always know where we are in our monthly budget. We got ourselves inexpensive smartphones so that we could track our budget like this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does the job"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I wish i can tell how much is the expense per envelope beside the  balance of the money inside the envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried to use it. Said it would allow one account for banking. Logged in and it said i had already used the slot. Never got to add so was unable to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Had to uninstall after 4 unsuccessful attempts to use this app.  Would not let me add envelopes.  It kept stopping each time I tried.  I hate this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I've just set up the app, and finally have found a budget app that has a more flexible pay dates. Being able to set 2 pay periods in a month with the 15th and ""last"" day of the month is the most accurate option I've found yet in an app.    What would make it as accurate as I need it however would be if it was based on ""business days"", as in the 15  and last of the month, or the most recent business day if either day falls on a non business day. I don't get paid on weekends or holidays, and that can mean up to 3 days difference with a long weekend.   For example if the 31st is on a Saturday, pay day is on the 30th.  If the 15th is on a Sunday, payday is on the 13th."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You can't add more than one bank account or so many envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No problems with it, has been very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple concept and easy to us. Just one minor problem for me - my income is four-weekly as opposed to monthly; it would be nice if there was an option for this.  ETA: Thanks to the developer for replying but I really do need an app that allows me to budget in the manner I receive my money and pay my bills.  Definitely recommend this to people who are paid monthly or weekly though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use daily"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Don't download it, it ask for money if you want to use it properly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Little difficult to understand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, fairly issue free. My only two criticisms are that it was a little tricky finding out how to reallocate my unallocated funds, and that it's a little annoying that I often can't use it if I don't have a good connection. Altogether, though, thumbs up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you are serious about turning around your finances, then this is the app. Based on the Ramsey challenge it totally works."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to help with communication over finances...no more wondering if we have $ left in an envelope. We've used this for a year now and really like it! Just upgraded to the premium to track all our accounts. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"$5/month for unlimited? ?  Way overpriced. Doesn't make sense for those trying to save money lol. Cannot recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Won't sync to my phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Clear and simple, thank you :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice way to keep record of ur daily n monthly weekly expnditures.....1 must havr it in dere mobiles"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Even with all the tutorials, it takes quite a few mistakes to understand what's happening. -edit- Gave up, couldn't figure out how to simply restart the month without carrying over the left over of last month. Not intuitive enough for me. I'm glad it works for others though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"If you have more than ten things a month for which you're budgeting and were hoping to utilize this app for free, move along."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes me back to when the kids were small and so was the family budget. Envelopes with cash helped keep us on budget. Now the budget is bigger, the bills are bigger and the kids are all grown and on their own. Used Good Budget for one month and saved over $500 - awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Has helped me to keep all of my expenses organized and easy to follow my planned budget on a daily/monthly basis."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"The envelope system was confusing for me. I prefer other more streamlined apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy and accurate"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has saved me a ton of money already"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I needed more envelopes but this app limits it to ten. That didn't work for me :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track of money and log spending and helps keep you within your budget on a daily basis. All around great tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Would have given a higher rating, but would not let me register saying they all ready have my email registered., Only problem is I have never used their site. Please explain."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its a little hard to get the hang of but after that it is GREAT!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is the only way I've been able to consistently budget and track expenses. I recommend it to everyone!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for nearly as long as it has existed and find it a really useful.budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"-no currency selection. -difficult to understand the savings scheming. Couldn't understand the UI"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful. I just wish everything that you can do on the Web, you could do in the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app allows us to use envelopes, without having money in  the house ... and I know what's in each category on the go!  It's a perfect app for our family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I didn't want whole financing app, nothing to do my banking on or to track my expenses. I just wanted a simple app to allow me to budget my expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have this downloaded on my phone, my computer, and boyfriends phone. So convenient to keep track of what's left. When using it on your computer you can check out your spending reports."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am absolutely in love with this app! It has helped me and my boyfriend tremendously with keeping up with our finances! I do wish there were either more free envelopes or just a small one time fee for the upgraded; but regardless I am really impressed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Its not correctly adding up numbers"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wanted a simple system that is easy to maintain and this fits the bill. AFAIK they don't sell your info to marketers, which is an issue with some other apps. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to deal with cash income or purchases in the free version. This results in your balance being off by however much cash you include in your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work at all. Crashes constantly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"What I like the most is the idea of envelope. It is user-friendly and easy to do budgeting. It allows me to keep track on where I spend my money and alert me when I overspending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Unable to sync for 3 days"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Why goes google + need to collect my info"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very Nice app.Userfriendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is simple and perfect. my husband uses mint and track our total worth constantly and that's useful. But sometimes I just need a simple tracker that calculated.money in and out in individual categories. Out help me.know how much I spent and.has.everything useful I need in it, while keeping it simple enough  to do in a quick moment on my phone. Perfect.            Update: 2 years later,  two phones later... still using this app. Sometimes keeping it simple is what I need. Thanks!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! It is the easiest way for my family to keep to a budget and be able to all be current as to transactions and balances. Not to mention the widget for droid is extremely convenient! Did I also mention it's FREE! Wow! Love it is an understatement."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps a lot"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Always thought I just would never be able to budget. Traditional budgets on spreadsheets are inconvenient. And YNAB is super expensive and still not intuitive. This has been so easy..and free! I tell everyone about this app now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Please allow classic version option, much prefer visuals of older version. Let use all choose which we prefer classic or new, keep everyone happy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love, love, love this app. It's great to be able to track my spending in real time. It's definitely kept me from eating out when I normally would have because I could clearly see I was nearing my allotted amount for that kind of fun. I'm looking forward to finally getting out of debt with the help of this app!!!!! I would recommend this app a thousand times over!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Keeps the family on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I have! As an accountant, I would love to be able to take receipt images and be able to split account transactions in debit and credit accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best bi-weekly budget app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Worx wekl"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Could never register. Very frustrating.  Kept saying account already exists.  Used 3 different email addresses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I dowload this app Today n its first time n surprised!!! its says my email id is already registered.. boss whts going on how u got my email id ....."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app. Very helpful. I wish there were more envelope though or atleast a fee to buy it and not a monthly subscription."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Recommended it to my fella, and he bought the paid version.  Nice work on this app.  Love it long time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to setup. Fast and easy to use. Syncs up great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I was scrolling for a budgeting app and had found one I liked and had downloaded it but as a precaution, I looked to see if there were any with better ratings. I found this app and the customer service and ratings convinced me to give it a try. I like that the makers of the app replied directly to several reviews and supplied info on how to deal with changes made as well as how to improve ratings and actually HELP the users! I hope the app is as good as the customer service! :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Practical & love that it syncs within seconds to the web or to another user within our family!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has help me so much. It has helped me keep organised so I don't over spend. I now have money saved which is something I was never able to do.                               Thanks so much :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Kick rocks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Why why why are some developers sooooo short sighted.  Consider that some people might want to use this on a tablet or tv box in landscape mode."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to get on and stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't know how we managed before getting this app. We can now budget as a couple and update as we spend so we know exactly whether we are within budget or not. When we spend we can do so without feeling guilty or worrying about it. Really easy to use too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good stuff. We have been using it for over two years now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great I use it every day"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"But I've gotten to a point where it says I HAVE to do some things on a website? Even though I was able to edit it in the app a few times before the warning."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good Budget aka EEBA"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app! The new UI looks great! I recommend GoodBudget to all of my friends/family. It would be helpful to have some charts that show how you're spending each month. Also can we hope to see android wear support? Maybe for quick transactions?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice and basic. Loving the envelope paradigm."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I'd give you 5 if I am able to get a summary of where most of my money is going over a certain period. Graphs or pie charts will make this app the app of the millennium."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded today and have set up my envelopes but it won't sync with the server!?  UPDATE, had to clear my data file and now it works just fine!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I cannot register with any name or email I provide.  It tells me they are already registered."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So easy - so powerful - what a pleasure"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A good, basic budget using a simple envelope system. I've given 4 stars as I am unable to register. No matter what name I use it states its already in use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Am giving a 5 star because the app is great but am having a hard tine syncing to server and the app crashes everytime I select [unallocated].. please assist, thank you"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have recently started using this budget app and love it!  Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App crashes as soon as it says my subscription has ended. Cant even use app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wish we could have more free envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been so helpful for my husband and I to keep our budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Not what im needing- it shows a barline and thats it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This help me and my husband stay on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Will not let me register with either of my email addresses says there are already those accounts"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Mostly easy to use. Till a while to figure out how to refill my envelopes, which should be easy and basic to do. The quick budget option is nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well across platforms. Make tracking expenses very easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The other comments say what I think, so I will share with you that they also have a website you can log into and use. It syncs with your phone's app and provides more information. Very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app keeps me on my toes.  watching every penny I spend consciously.  to use it wisely, I'm still learning. I wonder.... can I set it by percentages.. I will give it 5 stars if it was only a one time price for unlimited envelopes.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just getting started. Looks good so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its really helped me to keep track of my spending. Simple, easy to use once I figured it out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Thanks for giving 14-15 budgting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Limited envelopes. Does not sort them. Subscription $5.00/month. Same YNAB but without a desktop software and full demo trail period."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I need some more time to really use it as I just downloaded tonight but, it seems just ok right now. Like it could do the job but nothing special. However, I tried to register & it told me 3 Times to enter a valid email address... pretty darn sure I entered my own email address correctly. I erased & tried again. Same thing. Erased & tried again. Same thing again.. it just won't let me. I'll try again tomorrow but I can't say I want to continue using an app that screwed up already just while registering"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not enough envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app if you want to track expenses . Love the reports too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is perfect for my budgeting needs. The only thing is that I noticed that when adding budget or transaction amounts, when I make a mistake in typing, then correct it and hit OK, the saved amount still displays the error, so that I have to go back in and fix it again. Other than that I have experienced no other issues."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Takes a while to get into a flow of using it, but it's worth while."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Keep getting an error saying it won't sync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Top quality, easy to use, helping me save bucket loads"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to customize and to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I liked the idea of the envelope system to budget my money, but it seemed kind of inconvenient to carry around physical envelopes with cash every time I wanted to go shopping. So this app is perfect for me. The new redesign of the app is great too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded it and so far its everything I was looking for in an app like this... I will use it for a month and see how it goes but I love it so 5 stars (:"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like having this app on multiple devices so my husband and I both have access to the same real-time information. It's been a huge help for our budgeting and expense tracking. I only wish the free version had more envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I could not set up account never used before I put in my budget info and couldnt save any of the info I put in. It wouldnt let me create an account. What do I need to do? Dies it not work on samsung galaxyS111"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very convenient & useful. I use it everyday for every transaction"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the convenience of this app! Hope it will help my husband and I budget easier. Only problem so far is it has a problem syncing to the server... what can I do to make it sync so my husband can use it on his phone too???"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget is simple, easy to use, but has everything you need in a budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Trying to do cash envelopes and keeping up with receipts and change was too crazy. Love that my husband and I can each do it on our phones without having to remember to tell the other about some expense."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant, it's not overcomplicated just does what it should."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope budget for the mobile age. Keeps my wife and I synced with our spending. Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this,  is there any tips or instructions I could read our follow.  I'm unsure how to use it fully."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great little app! I love that it remembers the places you've shopped. You can enter items as a credit or expense and select multiple categories per purchase. Its been a huge help in making wise purchasing decisions for all the family members on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I never had a better app than this one. I just hope that the envelopes for free will be increased soon enough."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps stopping from spending way to much"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It can be a bit clunky at times, but all in all it's been super helpful for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I get paid by the hour, but don't have a set number of hours, so my monthly pay fluctuates a lot month to month. It'd be really helpful if instead of just a budget of dollar amounts, to put in a percent and have it calculated from your total amount.                 Other wise, this had been helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have been using GoodBudget since it was EEBA, and it has helped me tremendously as a college student managing my living expenses. Unfortunately, after the latest update, I am no longer able to specify currency, nor do I have the indicator on each envelope to tell me how far ahead or behind I am in each category. Would love to see these options back in."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Forget excel sheets, keeping receipts and logging in to your bank account to see the balance. This app is all you need to budget effectively and stick to it. Really happy it is free too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"There's a slight learning curve but we've found it very helpful. Filling the envelopes is easier to do on computer. Overall, like it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's like an easy notepad to carry around to track your spending. Creates amazing awareness to stop you from being stupid about money. Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Every 2 weeks I earn a different amount because i freelance and therefore I spend a separate amount each 2 weeks. I don't see how I can use this app. It limits my ability to have a different one time income entry each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"though UI is got room for improvement.  The web version is way more good looking.  A widget to show total expense and balance in a quick glance would be more than good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crashes every time I try to change the dollar amount of a budget envelope... Can't get past the setup stage 😕"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Navigating this app may actually be easier than plundering tombs...besides the family my family name was taken it looked great but felt clunky."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Thank you, though I still don't like the green bars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic support for this product!  Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been so helpful in our busy household.   I even installed it on my teenage son's phone to keep up with his own expenses!  Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what we needed to get our finances in order and get on track. So easy to use and keep up with, it makes life less stressful for my family. Thank you so much Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful and works for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the crap out of this app.  It's exactly what I needed and was looking for. A little confusing at first to use...oh my god where do I start?! But once I finally got into it. I don't even look at my bank account when spending anymore. I just pull up good budget and see if what I want to buy is in my budget and then record every financial transaction and check my bank account to make sure I really am on track. I love that you can even budget your savings!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Then it's $5/month which is a little steep if you ask me.  If you don't have many expenses it may work for you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's really nice and neat. Woulx be great if there is an optional tutorial to show around. I have to play with this app for a while to know how it work. Otherwise useful and neat app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Trying this out and so far I absolutely love it. More than likely I will be getting the full version. Love how the developer seems to listen to the user's opinion and requests"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful with keeping me on track financially. I love love loooooove it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Yay black is back - thank you! 5 stars again. This is one of my TOP 5 must have apps, I recommend this to everyone I know. Well done to the developers and thanks for the great support - you really do listen."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crap"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried Money For Life. This is much more to my liking. Very reasonable priced!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We've been using this for the last couple years (eeba). I've often wondered why checks wasn't a field. Now on the good budget site it's on there but not the app..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the facelift!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Everything I need to track spending. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This takes a while to understand but after you have set it up you will find that you will control your money better.  I recommend a n envelope for savings.  This will tell you the extra money you have monthly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Agree with sanders, though i just started using, but i prefer dark colors saves battery on my s3. Luckily i could enter as expense n then credit into another account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We have been using this app for around two years now. We love this app and have had no problems. This is a 5 star app but I really dislike the new background color.  Please give option for the black background."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped us to stay on top of our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its a nice app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app with helpful features to keep multiple people on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I would give it 5 stars but I think it's dumb I can have only 1 account. Paying for more accounts is not in my budget so I have to pretend that all my accounts are 1."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The reminder is not working."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My hubby and I recently stumbled upon this app after a long search for a budgeting app that we could sync between his iPhone and my android.  This app fits our needs perfectly.  It has worked seamlessly for us.  We are able to monitor our spending habits and adjust accordingly, because of the ease of use of this app and the fact that hubby and I can sync. I RECOMMEND!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I am very upset that I just spent the last hour downloading and putting my info into this app, to then be told that I can only use 10 envelopes (basically you can only have 10 bills a month-which may work for single folk, but not for a family!) Or I will have to pay to upgrade. Rediculous."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well. Updates can be bothersome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Easy to figure out with great instructions on website as well as editing capabilities.  5 stars when it has different timelines for each bill (weekly & monthly) & has sd backup.  UPDATE:  still doesn't have capability for 'weekly' AND 'monthly'.  It's good, but useless to me anymore without that option. UPDATE2  Thanks for listening! I'll be checking back soon."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app but you have to use it to see a difference in your finances! Better than all the other apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice help in organizing my spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the updated UI."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use yet detailed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not easy to use and even harder to change things after you input."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A very useful and easy to use budgetting app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Liked the old colour scheme better so i didn't upgrade. Great app though. Please give an option to choose theme colours."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like using this app. It is very convenient and easy to use. I rated it 4 stars because the new version's color theme is very plain and boring. I like the other color theme better. Bring it back!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"And now with tge new UI, I LOVE IT EVEN MORE!! great work, thanks for this great developement"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for more than a year. Works very well. I'm very pleased with the improvements."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for 3 years, great product, was initially disappointed with the addition of accounts (added complexity). Even though you have to use them it does not impede the basic envelope function."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Does not do what I need.  Can only do envelope system.  Very limited."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it's super easy to follow the envelope budget system as per Dave Ramsey's plan. With the updates that just came out its much easier to navigate as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely awesome. Simple, but has all the features I'm looking for. A+!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I get confused on how to delete envelopes our fill envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great free app for me and my wife to track expenses. Does everything I need it to. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it many times daily,love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like it. But I liked the old colors better.   Can you make the color scheme Configurable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The facelift recently given to the app is great.  Way better than the old-school previous version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Update: Have to take off a star for not offering an option for the black theme in the new version. Blinding white battery-sucking apps are a peeve. Please add an option and I'll add it back. screen suckingTry. Otherwise it's great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So happy to finally see an interface upgrade! Pls keep improving on the interface to make it easy for input and editing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great cross platform integration and easy to keep watch on your spends"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Loved this app. Very simple. Some graphs could be added."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app and the new color scheme, easier to see. Only thing I'd like is a different widget that would let you see you balance easily"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"hate the new set up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This new color scheme is so much better, it actually motivated me to stop being lazy and come to the app store and rate this great budget app which I've used for so long. So kudos to the developers. Good choices all around."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EDIT: The new update makes the app easier on the eyes. It's very handy and helps my wife and I keep track of our expenses. Because of the updated visuals I'm moving my rating from 4 stars to a 5. Keep up the good work!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The amount of money we've saved by just keeping track with EEBA is amazing. EDIT (July 31, 2014): I just wanted to say I love the new update and new look. Thanks for a great product."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what i was looking for in a budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Latest update, to version 2, has removed the option to turn off the accounts tab which sucks. Also the new color scheme is not as nice as the old one in my opinion. Would be nice to have the choice for what colors you would like..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you for updating the app to work on 4.1!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this style of budgeting. The app works pretty seamlessly. The cloud syncing makes it viable to use this with my wife. It used to be really ugly but they just redesigned it and it fits with Android style and is a joy to use. Bravo!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome envelope based budgeting software."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I love that we can both sync and have peace of mind that our information is backed up. And also now both know where we are financially at any given moment. The website is great as well. And if you need help, as I did on my Samsung they are just an email or a phone call away and the staff is very kind. They got my issue fixed in a matter of minutes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app is easy to use and a real help. You don't want to disappoint the adorable envelopes.  Not only does help stay on my budget but is a good way for me to keep track of what I am spending money on."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Jintha jintha good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Only 10 types of expenses are allowed in free version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Limited on the number of expenses without paying for an upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using over a month and I love it.  Helps quite a bit. You do have to pay the small monthly fee, but it's well worth it. Also has a website which updates quickly, either way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Goodbudget has done just that, helped me suceed in having a good budget. Would recommend to my family amd friends."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"You can only edit credits online. HUGE disadvantage. Also adding paycheck options is a little confusing. By the time you figure it all out you will need to reset and start over but there isn't a reset option."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The unallocated is actually the money that can be saved, so don't use it at unallocated to fill up envelopes. Instead. Whatever we didn't spend finish, put it in unallocated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Recurring income didn't auto add"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has revolutionized the envelope budget system for me. The envelope system was great to keep track of and cut down on spending, but it was such a chore to keep cash on hand all the time. With Goodbudget, all of the benefits of that system may be enjoyed without all the hassle of using real envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. The user experience can be improved but it's good overall. I like the feedback it gives you on how good or bad your spending is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"does everything I need to keep on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I have never used this app before. When I tried setting up my email. It says it has a user with that same info. Wtf? I've never used it. And I can't figure out how it works. Absolutely no tutorials on how it works."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, and customize. Customer service was very quick and thorough. All in all a great app which keeps my budget straight"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it and recommend it highly to everyone.   Easy to use and navigate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It is ok.  You have to be sure it has recently synced or you will be looking at wrong total.  It is difficult to set up and reload envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app its help soooo much to my wife and me to keep our finances on track i totally recommend this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love knowing how much is left in my budget right here on the phone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's unbelievable how easy it is to set this up.  AND you can sync it online.  The GUI of app could look a little nicer but whatever,  it gets the  job done.  Their website on the other hand has a beautiful GUI.  Thanks devs!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Crashed every time I choose transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use Goodbudget to allow us to follow the ""cash envelope"" system without having to carry around a bunch of cash. This is especially useful when shopping from two envelopes (e.g., groceries and clothing) at the same time. Easy to use and syncs with multiple devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Do not bother!  It's not user friendly at all you cannot edit funds once you distribute them. You can lose your mind trying to figure it out though. The envelope concept is great, but this app makes me want to toss my phone in a wood chipper. It's very awful and frustrating and if you want to waste hours of your life then go ahead and download it.  There is no support here or on the web. No tutorial.  Nothing to help you. Just can't replace a simple excel equation concept.  AAAARGGGHH!!!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife uses an iphone and I'm on Android. Nice syncing and no issues."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"When used correctly (took us awhile to remember to record every expense), this can make a huge difference in a family budget. Easy to personalize and adjust."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Ideal for making and sticking to a budget when youre busy and on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am terrible at budgeting and this app really helps me get control over my spending. I was always over spending and didn't even realize it until now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A fantastic app for anyone who is trying to be more mindful of their money. Quick and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"누가 알까"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Allows you to easily track purchases and place money into virtual envelopes...to keep in a budget. I like that I can use an envelope system and still make all my purchases with a rewards card...I just wish the free version allowed more accounts. I wouldnt mind paying a 1 time fee for an app with more accounts. But a monthly fee isnt something I want to budget for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wanted something to keep track of all my different expenses and this app has worked out great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has helped my wife and I keep to our budget. Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app had revolutionized my ability to manage my income and help me reach my savings goals.  Love having Goodbudget on the go, I book every expense as it happens and I know my bank account balance in real time! App can do pretty much do everything available on the website. It took a while to understand the features and use it how I wanted to, but after a while I feel like a pro! I highly recommend this if you are looking for a budgeting tool on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I called them today and a really nice young lady walked me through setting up my accounts and fixing my mistakes. She was happy to be there as long as I needed and didn't make me feel stupid which is huge. They are also updating the android app so things will only get better. Really feels nice to have a firm grip on my finances! Thank you Goodbudget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"8 digit numeric limitation, no seperation when input number so I must count the zero which is irritating, setup account must through web, basic UI, no repeat function. For the weakness I mention above I think is to pricy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app is too simple. I could have used it in high school but not as an adult with a five person household! I also couldn't separate monthly from biweekly expenses. It only allows yearly or one other category. Disappointing, given the good reviews I read....."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I've never used this app before but when opened it for the first time it already had spend data in it (in dollars). No introduction or instructions to begin with. No idea how to remove the incorrect (and not mine) spend data or change dollars to pounds... Really awkward. Am I missing something??"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been so helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like any budget, there is definitely a learning curve. Now that we're rolling with it, I love it. It makes me want to know where my money is going and planning tasks the stress off of spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"There hasn't been anything it couldn't do that I wanted it to. Took me two tries to get it set up right, though. Personal issues with how to categorize our spending. Love how easy it is to share with hubby."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent budget app. Only complaint is switch from current month to, next month is not one hundred percent intuitive. Great app though. Recommended..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful for syncing budget with my husband. The only complaints I have are that website can be confusing and it can be hard to fix mistakes when we enter things incorrectly. It would also be nice if you could purchase additional envelopes without upgrading to the version that syncs with your bank account. Other than that, this has been an extremely helpful app in helping us develop and stick to a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how easy it is to use and love that it can sync to my husband's phone so we can both see our budget at any time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful and really easy to use once you learn the basics. Read how to use it before messing around!  Helps you more that way"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good Budget has been very helpful for me in managing my expenses and savings. Can't imagine my life without this app!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App just crashes when trying to add transaction. Will re rate if fixed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple, easy to use ... Very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great electronic checkbook to keep track of your expenses and monitor spending. It keeps me within my budget by showing how much I have left in each category. The only minus is that the UI isn't as fluid as it could be. For a free app it is perfect though!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does what I want and great to be able to sync with someone else, but the UI is a bit clunky. It would be useful to be able to automatically reset the envelopes to their budget levels at a specified time of the month rather than having to manually distribute funds. Definitely a home budgeting app worth having though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app really does a good job."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My whole family uses this to stay on budget! Its great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It wanted me to subscribe"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I finally found an app that lets both my wife and I track our purchases against our budget and deals with the fact that our budget does not start on the first of the month. The envelope system works great for us. The premium version is too pricey for us. They need an intermediate version that costs a one time fee like 5 or 10 dollars and provides more regular envelopes (like 15 or 20) and maybe an additional account. I would pay for that kind of version. 1 star docked due to price of premium version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app will totally change the way you budget. Easy to use and life changing. Highly recommended!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With a little setup it does everything I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So simple & intutive to navigate. This is exactly what I needed to organize & track home expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It makes life so easier"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A handy tool and great way to budget and eliminate arguments."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's perfect to work out every cent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We had to get the upgrade because it's that great of a tool!  Is made tracking our money so much easier because it syncs beautifully with all of our devices and our desktop."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Cant edit the changes properly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps keep me and my wife organized."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really help keep spending and savings in tack. I track everything. Gives a real sense of security."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"And it's not ugly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"First couple of months the hardest, but once you get into the swing of things it will certainly save your bacon."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Makes you pay to use after."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like many couples, my hubby and I have a lot of relationship stress around finances. I am one of those weird people who enjoys budgeting and finds it rewarding. My husband, not so much. We'd finally reached a point of not fighting about it but not really working together either, which wasn't good for our financial situation. And then... I found Good budget. My hubby is now interested, he understands our financial situation, and he is really involved in making things better!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use in along with financial peace curriculum"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Beyond helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"As soon as i installed, i got spam emails. Very rude.deleted."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Even with the limited envelopes in the free version, I am able to keep track of every bit of money my family has. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"You need to use this app for 3 months to get the best from it. It really shows you where your money is going and the results surprised me. After 3 months reports you can start to use it to redistribute your dosh. 4 stars not 5 cos it can be a bit unclear at first"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is just what I was looking for. Entering new expenses is quick and the app is easy to navigate. Just don't let yourself get too behind with keeping envelopes up to date. It's a very useful budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Like it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's the 1st electronic service to actually help me budget correctly! THE ENVELOPE METHOD COMES TO THE DIGITAL AGE!!! :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budget is very helpful in such a way that it helps you become less stressed! You track your money and you know how much you have. . . .I started out with barely any money and so stressed out that I had to start planning where my money was going. . . I now have a plan and on top of everything I jave begun to save little by little. . I highly recommend good budget! !! Maje wise decisions with your money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app! My husband and I can both sync our phones and our envelopes. We follow Dave Ramsey and find this really helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budgeting helper app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Don't delay, this app really does help you to reign in your spending. The web app is fully featured and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great for keeping an eye on your budget and for saving up for goals"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't say enough about this app. Its very easy to use and helps a lot to keep my funds managed. The only issue is that certain functions are kind of hard to figure out how to do. Not a big take away though"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how my wife and I can sync our budget together on our own phone! Thanks guys!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This was the budgeting app that I found quickest and easiest to get started with. It shows you how much you've spent and can still spend at a glance, which I love. I just wish it had the ability to create graphs. Then it would be perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really love the app so far. My only drawback is that on the free one I can't have more than 10 envelopes. It works great and keeps track of everything keeping on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it regularly to keep track of our finances. It's a great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Nothing worked and couldnt access setting. Continuously shuts down."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best budget app. For android."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The only thing that would make this app better is being able to scan my receipts.  It's awesome to help us stay on budget.  My husband and I both have this app on our phones so we can both add ""transactions"" and both see them in real time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent and intuitive. So easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very pleased. Tried others but in the free range, no match. Simple, intuitive, helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loved how easy it was to use and manage my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for keeping track of where my money goes without needing to carry around envelopes of cash. Easy to use. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helpful. Reminds me of Dave Ramseys envelope system and that's why I downloaded it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Outstanding piece of kit... I Use it every day. Cheers!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"so far it seems quite easy to use. Keeps you on track all you need to do is excercise a bit of self discipline."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It does what's intended...keeps real good track but it is a little cumbersome to move around in because actions/bittons are not labeled intuitively."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"The first screen was all I wanted, just to see how much I would have left over at the end of the month. To see where I could cut back. The first screen is great, unfortunately, you only get to see it once, then it turns into a confusing envelope system"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice design"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this to keep or budget in track. It auto updates when you open it but you'll have to update it manually if you keep it open. It has been the best budget app and website we have used. I like that there's not any sensitive information like other budgeting sites, so if for some reason your password is hacked theres not much of anything of value stored here for hackers. We still use the free version but may upgrade to the pay version to get unlimited envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! I've been using it for years."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have this linked to our accounts. She uses it more than I do but is still a great check and balances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really great for monitoring your daily spending. Just open the app and document it and your done. My wife and I love it....we share the same one and the sync is quick"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app, but doesn't always sync. Have to try 4/5 times...then wait awhile. ......UPDATE......the syncing problems have been fixed! Now giving 5, well deserved stars!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budget saves my wife and I time and helps us communicate easily about our money. It only takes a second to track purchases and with the sync feature on our smart phones we stay on the same page."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use the free version to track the budget for my family.  Once it is set up it is easy to maintain and takes very little extra time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Please update the user interface. Bored of seeing the same from past 1 yr.   Excellent app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A great budget app. I've had trouble refilling envelopes, & with carry-over but all in it's really useful & user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I wish it were a little nicer to look at but it works well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.  Flexible.  This app is providing a method to keep our spending in line."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After doing the paper envelopes system for a few years, we were looking for a simple way to handle our budget electronically. I didn't want to give a system full access to my bank... Just something to keep count of expenses for us. This app takes care of it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"An excellent app that is helping us keep track of our money and stay on budget. It took a little bit to setup but worth it in the end."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have tried many diffrent apps for budgeting and i realy find this one easy to use and usefull. Very easy and you can move stuff around. I got it fast. Thanks keep up the good work! :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This application keep shutting down every time I enter settings"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My Wife and l use the app every day and have been able to finally stay within our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A very well made app for budget  management. Really helped me a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great app, do my whole finances in here now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've always hated carrying a check registrar... But this app & website makes it easy to record transactions & I love the envelope system. Very well designed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My family uses this app to manage ALL our finances.   Works great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I get all my friends to download this app. I love it because of the savings envelope which shows me progress and is separate to expenses. It also tells me an exact amount to transfer each pay. Oh, and I was able to specify budget period. The only thing I would improve is the ""unallocated"" section... How do you transfer from this envelope??"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using for few months now. A very good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App shuts down every time I try to add income."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Accessible online or from my phone, with all the features I need. I've been using it for a year now. It's awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The Only thing I would change is how it places amounts from the same day. Should be in order of when they were put in.  It works this way online but not in the mobile app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My spouse and I sync this app between our two smartphones and it has changed our financial lives. No more surprise overdraft charges, no more late fees, and no more arguments about who spent what. Our savings account is growing and we were even able to replace a hideous couch that we'd been hating for several years. All this after using the app for just 4 months! Whatever your financial goals are, this app is a great tool to help you get there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting tool. Simple and useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, also great features online when not using via mobile."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting simple through the app, but then  gives you more detail and info with the online account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it.  Thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An excellent budget app. Easily let's you track and manage where your money is going and where you should curb your spending to stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used GoodBudget for 1 yr now. It is the best! Easy to use. Once set up (& you stick to your budget) you'll be surprised how in control you become with your $. I have no more ""scary"" bills I cant pay, credit cards under control and guilt free spending money. Its all managed with this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great! Very well done app for budgeting. Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Goods"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Started using this app when it was eeba and I have loved it ever since. Would like to see some UI changes such as an option to change to a lighter background or the ability to create spending dashboards on the device. Overall a great concept for an app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes some getting used to but makes household budgeting an easier task."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget tool for my wife and I"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the app."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great synchronizing budget tool! My wife and I have been using for years"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband's and I wouldn't know what to do without this app. It had been so helpful. Easily update each envelope. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I wanted to start saving for a new house and we knew we needed to get control of our money.  This app is just what we needed.  We no longer have to tell our daughter she can't have a certain item that she wants.  When she asks, we tell her look at the budget.  If you have money in your account you can have it.  This has taught her how to save and wait for certain items and to realize she doesn't need everything.  In five months we have already saved almost $10,000."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Use it everyday"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used for two years, really helps me save for the little things I want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it on a two week budget and it's fantastic. Sure beats the excel spreadsheet. Just a little confusing to setup and get my beginning balances working right, but it is awesome now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very smart and simple to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for just under a year and its my lifeline. I can track all my money and I can finally save for my wedding. Best budget app out there."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective budget management, thanks a lot for this application."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app for keeping track of our budget. Helps us stay where we want to be."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best budget app out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The application serves its purpose: budget your income and keep track of your expenses. But the entire user experience is outdated with the latest android application user experience."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Started using this app in Oct '13, and have saved enough to pay off 4 credit cards in 6 months!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fast, easy to use, excellent for keeping track of expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for tracking your spending each month. It is easy to use and has some great features."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Top notch app and good service if you've got dramas with it. 5*"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I love this app.  For a family of four and a busy schedule, it helps us keep our spending within budget.  It can be easy to swipe a card and forget about it but we depend on this app to keep us from overspending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It syncs my device automatically with my husband's, so we actually know how much we've spent. It's intuitive and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT. It has all the basics I need. I have not looked for another budget app since I found this one."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love it. Its a little hard to figure out at first but once u do its wonderful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using this app to keep our budget for near two years now! It is a life saver. :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use , works really well, and has some excellent features like exporting to csv. I use it every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what we need to keep track of our spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helped me get of debt. In fact, I'd probably still be in debt without it. Everyone says to keep a budget, but I found that doing so was just too hard. Not anymore. By simply planning out my spending beforehand, and then recording EVERY purchase in the app, I was able to quickly get my over spending under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps track of all my money, I us the annual envelopes like monthly, they just don't auto fill. Took me a while to find menu when I got a new phone, but I did. Little dotted line in bottom right on Motorola moto1. Love the fact that my husband and I can both impute expenses from our phones and know how much money is left. Just wish it   would auto sync every time you open so that I'd know what he had spent. Otherwise LOVE IT!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love goodbudget, been with them since they were EEBA. This is the only app that has actually helped me save money and follow a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Trash it. Every username and email I enter is already used This is sh**"""". Fix this or remove"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work for galaxy S5...please fix I have no clue how much money I have...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until I ran out of envelopes how can you punch it without having all your bills listed. And then was told to go to the website. I don't own a computer I depend on my mobile apps. Fix that and it would be a great app 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is good with budgeting but it be better off you weer able to go back and change how often you budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I use this on my Nexus 4 and 7. It sync's over both devices and is pretty simple to use. I'd recommend this to anyone requiring the need for a personal budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would be good to get the UI updated to look nicer but otherwise, very useful to keep track of spending and budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Behaves as if it has a mind of its own.  Very unstable.  Impossible to make changes to erroneous amounts.  No delete budget function.  Disappointing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried Manny even pay ones and one's the best. Especially due to the easy allocation possibilities. Now if you could make it easier to close off a month of transactions it would be exactly what I need."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's the only way my husband and I could imagine budgeting and staying on track. Works great for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Was a good app but now it won't save stuff please fix"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Great idea but crashes every time I had the transactions tab"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had used the actual envelope method for a few years but I wanted something that would keep track of the amounts and I love this app for that. I did purchase the pro as my family has a lot envelopes so I needed more than the standard."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"What would make it better is if you could change dollars into other currencys such as South African Rands."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"No menu on kit kat makes this app very hard to use - such a shame."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Its way too confusing to use when you just want to keep track of your expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It's too basic. Needs more features to be useful. So far My Economy and basicbudget are WAY better, but even those need a few tweeks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It has been great but now it is messing up and saying I can only change things online and I can't change my unallocated slot at all.... this has been a wonderful help, please fix it and I will give back all your stars. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent program!! Keeps me on track every month! I love the little envelope sad face or  happy face."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My first app rating ever! That's how much I love this app! It changed our spending culture in a very positive way."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent Application! Easy to start and easy to keep up to date. Hope all functionalities from old eeba website are migrated to the goodbudget site soon, but this is not a big issue."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I like the overall function of the app, but every time I go to settings to change something the app force stops.  Deal breaker for me.  Galaxy S4 phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Only available in dollars, and can't do a four weekly budget rather than monlthy, otherwise looks pretty good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.  Works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I tried so many accounting software but this is the only one exactly what   I wanted.  It's just old way make envelope for every category and follow your budget. I can record right from my phone when I spend money so I never forget. I love this App."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Loved everything accept the fact that I have to restock on my own a month, my income and my bills."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Terrible. It won't let me remove the gas expense despite it not being one of my expenses, keeps reverting other expenses to what the presets were. Uninstalling and using a different app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Keeps deleting my budget and wont sync between galaxy 4 and note 8.0"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budgeting and transaction app out there!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Amazing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app lets me track my budget on the go. It's so much more convenient than waiting for the bank to post transactions, which could take days. I'm going to recommend this app to my family and friends! I minus 1 star because it takes a few minutes to learn how to use it. It's not really self explanatory, but it's not hard either once you figure it out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is a very helpful app that can even help minimize unnecessary spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashing on my Nexus 4.  Unusable."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful and easy to set up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Needs to be able to work on a single envelope. where I can fill an envelope with a credit. then empty envelope with a expense. right now I have a envelope that says not allocate  I can not get it to empty or allocated to any other envelope so I'm stuck with a envelope with X amount of dollars in it. Making it confusing to see how much I have"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Like the mobile app but not the desktop version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Loved it but had a problem syncing. So I logged out to login again but all my local transactions are lost together with my envelop setups.  :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"What happened? I had given you 5 stars before but after updating to Goodbudget, it doesn't sync. Worst of all, I logged out of my mobile app and when I logged back in, it could only update till Aug 2011 even tho the website has 2014 data. 3yrs data lost and still can't sync? What crap is this?  If you can't fix this then this app is useless and will uninstall! WTF!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"But I loved it b4 the last update where they made it difficult to put it the total amount and I miss the calculator -_- but other than that, the app is good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice and simple.  Don't have to keep cash at home and always know how much I have to spend.  Would give it 5 stars if it was reasonably priced to upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love that the whole household can stay in sink with the budget.  I only wish the widget would have a running total in it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried setting up account, says my email was already used. How is that possible? Can people put any email and you guys don't have a verification system?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just had a phone call with Sheann (sounds cute btw) 100% satisfied with every level of customer service she provided. Having the app work like a charm *Bounus* love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No hassle. Helps us keep our spending accounted for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Single currency only, unfortunately."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sync function is not working, even if I am trying manually. So I would lose 3 months expenses data if I log out from the app or upgrade my firmware. I have used a lot of time recording the expenses on Goodbudget as I thought it would be reliable.   There is no option of local export so there is no possibility of saving data locally in case there is any malfunction with the app.   I am contacting the support, if the issue gets resolved with my data intact, I will change the rating."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this app since 2012, been exactly what I needed to guide me through the budgeting process, it's fantastic. Like others I'd like to see a graphical update, to an interface a bit less drab, I suppose it's a tad tiring after a couple of years, but that's a minor quibble against what positive EEBA/Goodbudget have given me. Thanks for your great work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having tried loads of budgeting apps I have returned to this as it strikes the right balance between functionality and usability. The widgets are excellent and the use of GPS to guess what shop and budget category saves time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I work at a bank. And I suggested this app go everyone that opens an account."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"but app stops when accessing settings"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good work!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's just what it should be.  Short learning curve and very useful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"First time using, messed up but theres no start over option and popup says the only way to edit my $ info is through the website...I go on the site, figure I may as well add my bank account but when I get back in the app, I see my entire bank balance has been added to my initial balance- which already included my bank funds. I try to edit but again it says im only allowed to edit through their website, which btw is not optimized for mobile. Why do I have to use a pc to use an app? Why cant I edit in-app?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really simple and easy to use but you max out at 10 envelopes which would be good for most not my style. I like to individualize everything. I registered online to get more envelopes but you have to pay for it... also not my style."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good except now that is the end of the month it doesnt reset itself. Also to sync with another device it tells me it can't because I have two devices linked already but I only have one"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is wonderful and I have been using it for years, but I think what would make it the best out there. Is being able to sync with bank account. A check register that's linked up to bank account all the time that is the coolest thing possible and would definitely convince me to buy the pro version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"No text"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Trouble synching right from the start (HTC EVO LTE - Sprint). Also appears you cannot delete an errant transaction... Which would be easier than needing to create clutter with a refund transaction."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I found it so hard to drill our household budget into my husband until we got this app! Fantastic way to be more conscious of how you spend your money.  One suggestion I have to make this app even better - I use hashtags to track all my tax deductible expenses. It would be great to be able attach a photo of the receipt in the transaction record so I have everything I need at tax time. Keen to hear your thoughts on this suggestion.  Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes a bit too get used to and it's not super intuitive but it's not bad either.works great one you figure everything out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and set up. Great looking website and love that it syncs to hubbys iphone!   It would be better if I could view budget pie chart for visual comparison of where my money is going, and a desktop widget with current account balance would be 5 star worthy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A good and useful budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"This way of budgeting makes no sense to me.  Extremely confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I use this app. Its great because of the web syncing. We can both enter charges."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"But interface is not nearly as nice as the quality of the apps abilities.   Still good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like this app because of its simplicity. It's easy to quickly add expenditures.  However, I don't always follow my budget as I should and have to start over after a couple of months sometimes. So far,  this means I have to set up a new account because I always have trouble getting the envelopes to go back to original fill amounts without throwing off the budget. Aargh. Also, it would be nice if this one would graph my expenditures on a monthly basis. Oh, i don't like the name/widget change either."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I start the app, irrelevant budget already up.  Can't remove unallocated money.  Nowhere to restart.  Tried googling solution, no avail.  App is unusable from my end.  Would love to see a fresh start button in the settings.  Otherwise, uninstalled and am left abandoned by what seemed to be the best budgeting app in the android market.  I left a five star to help.  Help me help my poor money management?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used this system for awhile, but I had to discontinue because I had no way of tracking my bank accounts unless I paid for it. But now, you're able to link a bank account for free! Such a lifesaver and time saver! This program is much easier to understand and has the capability to budget semi-monthly, unlike others I used. This app is perfect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"After initial set up I couldn't go back and add another envelope. I had to go online from my computer to make changes to the envelopes. I also tried changing the amounts budgeted for each envelope and instead of changing the total amount of budgeted item....it added to what I already had budgeted for that item. It would mot let me change it...or at least it wasn't easy enough to figure out. Plus I could not figure out how to show that I paid a bill out of the envelopes. It needs a video or tutorial of some sort for new users. I can usually figure out new apps after a few trials and errors...but this frustrated me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great customer service great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for my wife and I. Perfect tool to keep our spending in check and make sure we are on track to our financial goals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Advice from a finacial analyst, get a different app. This is the absolute worst. Once you create a profile you cannot add new categories."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I cnt delete if I wrongly put the amount... Not really a friendly user especially on the add $ function."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried registering with two different personal emails and the app said both were already registered. Yeah, I don't think so..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, it helped me to plan my budget and helps me to save. I really like this app,  if you are not good at saving then this is a good appm"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I delete an income line only to find it immediately returns to my total monthly income.  It doesn't record some expense lines which throws off the allocations. Force closes constantly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for about a year now, and I love everything about it. In fact it's even better now, with the option to ""distribute from unallocated"" directly from the app instead of going to the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I loved the app, but I wish they would update it to fit the new Android design guidelines. I saw the one for iOS and it is brand new. Hoping a new design comes along soon. But it is very functional!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The website is a joke. This is meant as a application only. The website seems as a after thought.  It only allows you to have 10 expense catagories. Unless you pay for it.  This application keeps doubling my income. Wish it was that simple to make more money. But makes the application worthless when the goal is to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"...this UI really, REALLY needs an update! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This function has been remove. Why?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"5 bucks a month for more envelopes. I will give you a $10 one time fee for the plus.  If not, then I will just use a spreadsheet and do the same thing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Unable to access. Always crash"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I hope u can add jordanian dinar(JD)currency..really appreciate it if u do so"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Gooooood"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps me know exactly where we are in our budget for the month. No surprises anymore...we adjust where we need to so we don't overspend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Do not like the Goodbudget set up online. It used to resemble the phone app and now it looks like every other financial program. If I wanted every other financial program I would have gotten them. EEBA was different and that was the draw. I am afraid that Goodbudget will morph into all the other financial apps and that is sad. It was a 5 now a 2"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I actually find this very tailor-fit to the way I budget my money.  I literally started with physical envelopes for each type of expenditure I had and this is a good way to monitor my budget. I love the fact that I now have a digital way of doing that without actually dividing my money in each physical envelope.  I just put down how much I spent, and which part of the budget I'm supposed to get it from. It does come with a widget so you can easily record transactions! Yey!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"UPDATE MORE"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"cool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tried to change n add envelopes but it always put my envelope as empty n didn't have instructions good enough to figure out my problem. Would not recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great product."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I would love to try your app but I am unable to get it installed ob my Galaxy S4 with ATT running Android 4.3 The app says it is 100% installed but unable to open it. Any suggestions? Thanks.. BR"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I made a budget and saved it, went back to it signed in and it wasn't there and tried to make one again but now all it does is force close!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Learning curve is longer than others I have tried. I would not recommend this app to anyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app. Provides mobile functionality that syncs with your Goodbudget account. Great customer service. I originally used the app on a Nexus 4 and it would crash while trying to sync with my account. Goodbudget did a great job communicating with me and resolving the issue. The app works great - I had trouble with the Goodbudget envelope concepts, so I've actually chosen to no longer use it for my budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Can only put in 10 bills before being made to pay for the upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I love using this app to keep us on a budget and keep track of what we spend. Update 11/27/13: Recent syncing and battery issues were fixed quickly with friendly support."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app, works flawlessly. Customer support is fantastic and very responsive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is such a fantastic app and so simple to use. I've recommended it to everyone I know!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Loved, loved, loved this until a week ago and now won't sync.  I really hope the issues get fixed, I would hate to lose this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works very well on my galaxy s4"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the app, but I miss the big-eyed envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Please update to the modern android UI..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"My husband and I have been using the app for several months now, but after the last update the app does not sync anymore.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  Did not work.  Never had issues before this. Would give it more stars if I was able to use to use it. Also, the name Goodbudget sounds corny, liked EEBA better and the old icon was cuter."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Had problems converting from eeba but they had awesome customer service and a quick solution. Best app I have."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A great app if you have the time to enter every receipt. Wish it divided the money weekly instead of daily."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app has a lot of potential. The UI is a bit dated/stale, but the concept is great. I've noticed the name's changed but there's a bug when I hit the ""Transactions"" tab, the app crashes every single time. Very frustrating. And I just upgraded to the ""Plus"" version to get more features I needed. Fix this ASAP and I'll change my review to 5 Stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"After many requests for a print function to be added to the old app I finally cancelled my paid subscription and uninstalled the app. I got an email raving about the new app how much better it is. How disappointed I am that I still can't print a report. How can you make a major change in the program and not add a print option. If you don't have a print option you won't get my business."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Use to tell everyone about this app but with change from EEBA to Goodbudget the simplicity is lost as is some of the functionality. Too bad!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Goodbudget is NOT!  In 3 yrs that I used EEBA I never had to read instructions to understand how to use it! Suddenly I have to figure out what the designer of ""Good""budget is accomplishing by UNallocating the same money that I'm allocating. RUINED the perfect budgeting tool. !@#&$%@#@*&^%^#$!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"What happened?!?! The newest update now drains my battery.  Time to find a new app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The previous version of appwas good, but since the update and name change it is using over 40% of my battery."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We tried several budgeting apps and this one is by far the best. While is not the prettiest, it is the most functional and customizable one. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't over spend and for once I feel in control of my money...my husband and I are making extreme progress!	Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has really changed the way I handle my budget. Set up can be a little challenging at first, but after that the app really helps keep my budget under control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I use this app to budget between our incomes and save up for our summer vacations. I can't think of anything I would change. It works great for a family and has helped us save SO much money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for dividing out your paycheck so you know exactly what goes to monthly and irregular bills, and what is leftover. I love that you can share spending updates on another phone, for example your spouses, and even leave notes. Best of all, the app does not require that you sync with your bank account. I personally am not comfortable putting my bank account info out there for budgeting.  I just manually enter eact receipt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Since the move to goodbudget it became more complicated.  I can't budget the way I used to in eeba.  Uninstalling"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helped me get our spending under control. The best way I've found to monitor my expenses on a daily basis and free up our lives from debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just starting with the tool and is already helping to stay within our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Without this app I don't think I would be where I am today, financially! it's great it's helped me administer my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I was able to install it on one device (nexus 7, 2013) but any other device I try to install it on tells me that I'm over my device limit (I've only ever been able to get one device to connect). Maybe this is a bug, I'm not sure?   If they only allow one device per account that's fine but they shouldn't advertise that free accounts allow 2 devices. So I never got to try the multi-user system. That sucks because this seemed like something I might have paid for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I've been an EEBA fan for a long time but the old interface is really turning me off. I hope you can change the design for the app these way you did for the website :) Will rate better once UI is updated!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Cash in, cash out. It is that simple. My husband and I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app! Crosses multiple devices! Outstanding app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to manage once you learn your way around, love that it sincs with both of our devices and our online account. You can manage it from paycheck to paycheck which makes budgeting easier to learn from and adjust as needed. Again it takes time to navigate and figure some things out, but after that you'll love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally something that works for a mobi lifestyle"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Would only let me input 10 items before telling me to pay to get more space"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Love the online budgeting envelopes. This has made our financial life much simpler. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to keep a tighter grip on finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Meets my needs and so easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple managment and good results. The sync between devices give this app the 5 stars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, very usefull love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Seriously the best app out the sync works great for my wife and I and it has helped us get our spending under control. cannot say enough good things!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and makes perfect sense for any household. If u arent using this you are wrong"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app - easy to use, love the sync feature!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"After reading The Debt-Free Spending Plan by JoAnneh Nagler, I went in search of an app to manage my Daily Needs spending. The app fit the bill perfectly. I change my budget every month and this app makes it easy to do."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app I can't wait to officially start using it I do wish it would let you manually enter the day u want to start like for instant we have already used my first check (I get paid weekly) before I had this budget app it would be nice to be able to still budget monthly on the first but be able to start this month on the 6th so it won't count my previous check and screw up my budget tracking for this month but all in all we r excited and can't wait to save some money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall,  *very* easy to use. As someone else said,  there is a learning curve but once you figure it out,  awesome app!  My only suggestion is a way to make certain envelopes budgeted for the month (such as rent or insurance) and others weekly (gas and groceries). Also,  some more room to make adjustments to pay or income would be great (i work two jobs and get paid different rates at both).  Those few adjustments would totally make this an unbelievable app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I downloaded this on phone and laptop and really liked it. I had to uninstall it on my phone. Something is constantly running on it and it drains my battery.  I was getting 6 hours as comoared to 2 days. Certainly not worth that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Features are very limited unless you subscribe"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Only works in dollars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If the deluxe version costs money.. just add the ability to buy on google play store."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! My wife and I can both log our spending very easily! Definitely helps keep track of family budgeting!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!!!! Loves this app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Worth 3 bucks a month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ultimate, all aspects covered"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been wanting to start a budget & this app has been a great help. Takes about 10mins to get a proper feel for the app & how it works. Very user friendly in my opinion! Thank you EEBA for this free app! Just a thought: would be nice if i was sent a notification when my partner logged an expense :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what I always needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I first had this one and loved it. I tried out some other ones but i think this ones the best and easiest to use c:"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy use and helps stay on track day to day, while reducing debt and saving $ too."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really miss one certain feature: The bar should turn yellow if it falls behind the little white line.  That's all left to do to get a 5 star rating from me :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has the best combination of having the functions you want without loosing ease of simplicity.  I have tried several but this is the best for keeping track of your everyday expenses so you stay on budget.  I keep it on my phone and can quickly enter them in as soon as i get to my car."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is a great tool for keeping both halves of a couple informed as to where the monthly budget sits at any given time.  Simply an invaluable tool for those trying to reign in and track spending and get debt free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent is correct. Use it every day."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It works really well but I missed some steps and math the first time through resulting in some headaches. Once you understand it, the thing works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My finances are loving it too. I bet my accountant will at tax time ha!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app probably going to upgrade"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am on a low budget and the tool really helps to keep me in my budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For th3 first time in my adult life I finally can keep track of my money. Growing up with ATM cards makes acces to spending so easy I lost track alll of the time. Since I started using EEBA, I dont have to pay overdraft fees. I paid for tye full version. First app I paid for in 5 years. Easy, fast, use it right after my purchases. I am usually with8ng 10 bucks of my balance between pay intervals which is unbelievable for me. Last year I probably paid $2000 in late fees. Since EEBA $0!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for helping me get out of debt!  Know where your money is going!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once I got the hang of it...its a great app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does everything you need . I have used many different ones and not even one is close to this one so far..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I won't live without EEBA.  I always know where my money is, and it is such a relief.  But... I wish they would work on the UI to streamline/speed-up transaction entry."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.  They thought of every situation in a person's financial life and accommodated for it. Quick response to questions, excellent support. A little bit of humor thrown in gives me a few smiles. I went over budget on something and the little envelope guy looked horrified. Sort of silly without going over the top. Syncs up so I can use it on my pc or my phone. They thought of everything yet kept it simple. I Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for recording daily expenses. Easy enough to use that I've been consistent with it. Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and it has helped me with my budget :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Could use a cleaner ui"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I tried setting this up as a weekly budget where bills get paid one week and the next I don't have any bills but it kept saying I was over my spending. Pretty useless app if you want to do this. Looks like it would be good if I got paid monthly. Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app and has really helped me budget better. Easy to link with online and another phone user."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps my expenses on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"...after one week, both my husband and I are loving this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Nice app but too expensive to purchase full version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great for keeping track of spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It keeps me on track with my money and it works so well with my budgeting style."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a very nice tool that helps you keep track of where your money is going. Once an entry is created the first time, I can create additional entries with only 3 or 4 'clicks'. really nice reports are available when accessing the app via the web. The ONLY drawback that I have found is you can't automatically refill your envelopes at the beginning of each month unless you pay for a subscription. That's not a big deal & is very easy to do via the web interface, I'm just too cheap!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I tried to back out, but it wouldn't let me.  Uninstalling."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Pretty decent app.  Difficult to reset your budget each month if you have a varied income, but otherwise it vet's the job done."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Interface is basic, but it works well on older devices. The app works solidly and is a great help to my budgeting as I have my budget with me whereever I go. I have not encountered any bugs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My wife and I use this app to keep ourselves on budget and have been pretty happy with it.  The only downside is that you can only connect 2 devices to each account and only get 10 envelopes for free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Where I could have the budgets set and see where I'm at along the way. No calculating. No confusing settings. I also love that when you're behind in a certain envelope it tells you how long you need to stop spending to get back on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The exact budgeting method I've used forever now completely handy on my phone and has accounting as well!  Working on getting all my accounting switched over. So excited to have everything in one place and in the palm of my hand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best budgeting tool my husband and I have ever come across."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Concept is great but ability to refill or reset monthly without completely wiping out envelopes is frustrating. Adding funds to existing envelopes is a little tedious as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I'm happy with it compared to the other free versions of similar apps as it allows me to do more. I can do simple budgeting and monitoring. It's not stand-alone as you'll need to go to the app website for certain options and tasks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Taking the Financial Peace University course and this app beats the daylights out of dealing with a bunch of cash envelopes. Thanks EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the first mobile app I have used to manage money, and I have found it easy to use and much more convenient than paper. I'm glad my brother-in-law recommend EEBA."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app to work out a budget,  I would love if they added a feature to see the envelopes percentage of total money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am a graduate learning how to manage my money more responsibly and EEBA has been an excellent tool!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great work EBAA ... Love ya."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great and totally helps me to keep track of my spending. Much easier than keeping several envelopes of cash on hand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It works great and helps keep us on track. I wish the 'fill envelopes' was a little easier but overall it's a simple app that helps us keep on track with our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great Software"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and his cash envelopes budget tool but didn't like carrying cash around in this tech savvy age. This app is the next best thing. Can't imagine budgeting without it. Thanks! :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"really helpful. A little challenging to start over each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"By far the best way to budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Out of the free apps I've found this one has the best functionality. Layout and readability of the webapp could be a bit better though"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for our family"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My family had had to downsize our finances. EEBA is making it possible for us to stay on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super helpful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App for helping you set up your budget. Would recommended this app if you are looking for a great app to help maintain your spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"When I download a free app, I expect to have full use of it unless it clearly says before I download that I won't.  So I started adding in my expenses only to f I find I can only have 10 in the free version.  Well, how do I know I want to buy it if I can't even try it?  So, uninstalled and chose a different app that is the original envelope budgeting app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Definitely helps manage budget but I would like to see graphs and also a reset button to start afresh each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA is the only budgeting and account tracking software I have found to fit my family's needs. The ability to make entries at the time of sale, sync across devices and ease of use make it a spectacular tool. I highly recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately Eeba has stopped after clicking Transactions. Uninstalling"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use but only ten envelopes for ten different payees. I'll keep looking for a free app to suit my needs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helps me keep track of how much I've spent. Does what it says on the tin, basically."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Don't have to guess how much you've spent. Track it! Helpful for me and my husband."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome financial tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome budget app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The app is great,  but we hate that the envelopes frowns and smiles.   Please have an option to remove it.   I also wish there was an easier way to add monthly exprnses in a bimonthly pay day set up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great easy to use I've recently started using widget for reoccurring expenses. I recommend it to family and friends regularly.  Edit   I've used the free 10 envelopes for several year now and still love it, great for keeping me on track without making me feel like i have to carry cash  or punished for being on a budget. It's a good feeling when you can keep everything in the green :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful budgeting tool. Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We really like this app and use it everyday."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is simple, yet has all the features I need!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best Budget app I've found yet. Should be 5 star. But I can't start fresh if desired. And glitchy when a couple shares a budget.  I'll be keeping this App for sure."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Would be nice if you could have different currency symbols because not all of us live in countries that use the dollar as the national currency."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A saving envelope option would make it great - but the app is fantastic, thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works perfect and highly recommend it to anyone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Would not have a clue how much of my money is already committed to upcoming expenses without this thing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We recently upgraded to the pay version. Everything balances easier (once you get the hang of it) and both my hubby and I have easy access to our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I can't change dollars to gruvnja"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA has helped my Wife and I do a proper budget that we can finally follow easily. Thanks EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We are fans of Dave Ramsey and tried a physical envelope system, but it was too impractical. EEBA let's us run our envelope budget system with ease. I could not imagine a better way to keep track of my personal finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had issues with separating parts of my budget. Eeba helps me see what my wife and I have spent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I do not use all of its features but it has everything I wanted as my student financial planner app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My first time using a budget app. User lack of knowledge. It is getting better as I go. Struggled with clearing everything in order to start over."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Crashes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Enormous help"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love the app, really is What I was looking for. However it takes some time to find out how to use it. Overall great job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love!!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Cool app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Overall good, unfortunately only 10envlps thats free :("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app allows you to control your spending by increasing your awareness. It is surprisingly effective. Intuitive and easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app for simple budgeting and keeping track of my money. It takes some messing around with to figure everything out, but I like it. No extraneous functions, just a simple money envelope app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"THIS APP IS A LIFE SAVER"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me within budget at the point of sale."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budgeting tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thank you for coming up with this - so easy to use and yet so effective!!  If you could also add a feature  for recurring bills to be automatically entered eg rent, phone bill, spotify subscription. .. it would also help me to track my direct debit expenses that disappear without me knowing!  Thanks guys, I really love what you are doing!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the quick transaction widget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to track money especially with more than one person spending it! Instant updates of information."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Handy tool in monitoring your budget.  Can sync to several devices."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app allow me to keep track of my expense with my phone. I strongly suggest it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent at tracking my expenses and it lets the wife know exactly how much she is spending best feature every"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've used many different budget tools and this has been the best by far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!  We are already saving money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is super awesome! Great for my husband and I to both keep track of the finances. We kept both spending the same money and spending too much. This app syncs our purchases so we know exactly how much money is left in each envelope and we don't overspend!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I guess the 10% rule is working against me. I'm having some issues with getting it to work correctly for me. I'll figure it out as I'm sure it is something that I am doing wrong.....  Maybe more helpful instructions on how to make corrections and how to reconcile end of month budget would be helpful?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works Great for the envelop system. Doing the Dave Ramsey plan. Would give five stars if synced directly with my bank"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It really keeps me in the loop. I am no longer a slave to my finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful those coordinating a joint budget. App works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for managing simple budgets, fits exactly with how i think about budgeting. Highly recommended"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great.  No trouble.  No ads."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Kept force closing. Uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Like it a lot!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A very helpful everyday tool to help keep track of our family spending. Thankyou eeba!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is so simple and so incredibly useful. It has gotten us on track. Even my partner, who is naturally budgeting resistant, uses this. Sync works well. Wish we could have more envelopes, but maybe we ll fork over some money for that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used to live paycheck to paycheck but I started using this app along with the Total Money Makeover and Financial Peace University and I've never been better off with my finances. I'm controlling my money now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I really like this app I just really wish I could add more envelopes without paying!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says.   My wife and I used to have actual envelopes,  but now we don't need to carry them anymore.   Just what we needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app helps with budgeting funds and expenses"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I don't use the banking portion, but its a great the envelope system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Serves it's purpose well, simple concept, easy to use. One easily gets into the habit of being conscious about transactions and recording them regularly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for keeping track of how much your spending and on what kind of things! I absolutely love everything about it!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Y u no use eeba?!?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best thing every..love the way it becomes a team effort by way of our phones being linked together.. Helps have control over your money rather then just gessing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Brilliant budgeting tool, cannot fault it!! And it's completely free to try out - I'd give this six stars if I could :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy to use.  Allows for easy bi-weekly budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice simple budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This budget application is the easiest to use and it said best apps out there if you want to contain your budget I'm OK and always keep in mind that America is nothing but a bunch of baby days and Kane stage magic on face"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If the UI was improved it would be five stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome and helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep track on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app about 2 weeks now & so far I haven't had any issues.  We have been searching almost 3 years for an easier way to do Dave Ramsey's envelope system & this by far is the best way for my husband & I to keep track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I picked this app because it can be shared and synced on two phones.  I would have purchased an upgrade except it wants a subscription service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been a very beneficial way to track in areas we want to watch spending.  Great to be able to share with my husband"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"been using over a yr, very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get a handle on how it works it's fine. I would recommend reading the instructions first."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"There was something way much better than this"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Could use a few more features but overall a awesome app. The pro version should only be a one time fee. They should just make it a higher amount of money though!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple app to tack spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"My wife and I tried this for a couple months, but never had much success with it. There are a lot of things which should be easy to do, but are unnecessarily complicated. We switched over to the Mint app which allows unlimited budgets, for free, and is much more intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great! Love this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says its supposed to do and is easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like the easy virtual envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Still need a budget buddy to slap my hand at store... atleast this has red line for overage ... I'm a work in progress."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for managing budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome! I've been using it for almost two years now and I couldn't budget without it. It has helped me and my wife so much! Thank you EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"But it doesn't let me set custom envelopes or realize that one 2 week period might have the same income as another but probably doesn't have the same expenses. Not useful to me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice neat n very simple to use. Love it. Most importantly no adds."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I am looking for something  simple.  This is the closets I got. Would be better if they up the graphics."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Not only am I saving a lot of money using this app (because now I have to ask, ""do I really need to buy that?"") but this app has reduced the level of financial anxiety I have considerably. I set up how much I'm going to spend in each category (food, allowance, rent, tithe, etc.) and then just spend from those categories). It's easy to set up, inexpensive or free (!) and we'll worth the time given.  An update: I've been using EEBA since February 1st, and it has been a real blessing to our family. It's hard to believe all the money that we DON'T spend. We have gone from living"" ""paycheck - to - paycheck"" to saving money. This app has helped us discipline our spending - helped us to make decisions about our spending, and that has been a tremendous help. Thank you Team EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Wish you had the ability to debit into future months....other than that we love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simply rocks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Now that I've got it figured out, pretty handy. Will help me out, thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've only just started using it. So far, I'm very impressed. However, the forum link goes to a dead page. And once you allot money to something, I can't figure out how to adjust that amount without moving it to a dummy envelope, which shows as a transaction. Maybe I'm just using it wrong. But say I want to put 200 in the grocery envelope. But I then decide that I only want to put 100 in that for now because I need the rest elsewhere. I can't just unallocated the money. But like I said, I could be failing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what we needed to stay on top of our finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app ok. I like the real time updates but whenever I try to add an envelope it doesnt fill it up so it looks as if its empty when it's not. Please correct this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I am really having success with this app! Helping us stay on track in our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I gave this four stars just because getting the envelopes set to the right amount at first was a pain because I couldn't find how to just edit the amount in an envelope. We started using this app in the middle of a budgeting period. Other than that, I live how easy it is to keep up with our envelopes and that it syncs between our phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the perfect app for people, like me, who want to get a grip on their finances but are a bit challenged in the accountancy department. Well worth paying for the upgrades"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app keeps you honest"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Gooood"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Tried many other budget apps and this one does everything I want it to, even syncs online so if I change devices all my data is saved and restored, easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good tool, but it needs a major UI overhaul. This thing looks like it was designed back in the Android 1.6 days. Hideous."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very convenient as long as you can use a max of ten envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Life changing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It needs more detailed instructions however it I'd really good. It has a learning curve but I would recommend it cause it CD an sync to the computer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to record expenses and set up budget. I use the free version. Only downside is that adding money can be confusing. I had to start over once because I added money using the wrong option. I love that my wife can access the same account from her iPhone (I use Android)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome system. It makes it so easy to msnage your money/budget on the go."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"So helpful, I've saved hundreds of dollars since using this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just can't figure out how to get rid of ""unallocated"" envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This a great app. Exactly what I needed to manage my money better. Love the ability to see my spending cash while putting money away for bills."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to watch your money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Versatile system for budgeting. Love that two can access the same envelopes from two smartphones. Options for filling envelopes are endless and there is always a way to accurately account for odd income or transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"US dollar only"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this! Makes budgeting with multiple spenders super convenient!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is so helpfuli"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just started using it.  Spent some time setting up, with a few false starts and NOW we have it working!!!  I had no clue how much I could spend when, now it's simpler and I have a clue....my wife is happy with me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its a really complicated system, especially when you look at allbtge offerings but once you get to know if, its the best budgeter in the world."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Any possible UI updates? The widget doesn't scale well on high res screens, and the UI could use a freshening."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and helps keep my husband and I keep on track each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Should add receipt scanner to keep my softcopy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful tool for setting and keeping a household budget for me and my fiancee. We have been using EEBA almost a couple years now and it beats shared spreadsheets and the like"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to manage money and be able to realtime track expenses without carrying anything extra like a notebook.  Also like the multiple device sync so the entire household can be on the same page!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to refill envelopes and there  isn't  instructions on how to delete a fill if there is a mistake. Should be more user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for budgeting. I just wish there was a way to delete accidental transaction through the mobile app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep to a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Some features might be desired such as multiple accounts per phone but overall is a nice very useful app. Would download again."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really love the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelopes are very good to use once setup. Some features are difficult to figure out how to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very effective"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I knew was good at budgeting, this app is helping me to improve."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app. So organized and helpful for my budget! Been using it a couple of months and have not had any issues. Also I have gotten rid of my checkbook."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A highly useful and intuitive app that interfaces well with the website for constant updates to anyone's budget. Two Thumbs Up!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Works OK. Crashed a few times. I found it not to be user friendly in about one hour.  Initial setup was easy just not ""filling the envelopes"" or adding expenses both of which are done through the settings."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've heard of the envelope system from my friends,  and am glad to find a digital version in an app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I was so excited when I found an app for the envelope budgeting system. This method works the best for me, and although it was a little bit time consuming for me to set up the first time, I love how simple it is and will continue to use it to keep track of my budget. I'm just waiting to see if a cheaper option which includes the ""Accounts"" comes out before I give it 5 stars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what i needed it to do, and then some features to make it more convienent like the location support for autocomplete."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have been using EEBA for over two years and love it. My husband and I both have it on our phones and simply enter what we spend as we spend it.    Couldn't get any easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great good works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Sometimes I have trouble getting it to do what I want, but I figure it out eventually."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what you would expect of cloud based budget software. Site and app work well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This really helps you see where u money is going before you start spending helping you not to overspend"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It had been great to have my envelope system electronic. I don't leave the store until I have entered it. Now I can stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Can't download the app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app. Easy to use and helpful for keeping an eye on spending. I don't find it helpful in saving. I don't like the unallocated system of ""saving"". I'm a see it, so spend it person. But I have learned a lot about where my money goes!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use, great support (I emailed for help with something and got a thorough and helpful reply) and love the feature to share / sync envelopes between users in the household."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Fickle for monthly budgeting"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good budgeting application"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, useful, helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I just wanted a free and easy application to manage my monthly expenses.. and I think I found it with this app.  No bells and whistles to get in my way. Just money-in money-out functions.  Thanks for this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app functions pretty well as a way for my wife and I to keep track of our finances. No functionality complaints."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple n functional. I tried a few budget apps n this one works for me n my family. I like that u can access it on more than one device so we can always be on the same page about the household budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm a spender and for me out of sight out of mind. This app put my spending right in front of me and thanks to this app I am buying my first condo!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally an app that is truly based on the envelope system."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I went into budgeting software (and budgeting) blind.  This program has helped tremendously.	I have never been very good with keeping a budget. Recently I decided that couldn't continue but I had no idea where to start. I looked at quite a few software packages before I chose this program. The envelope system is ridiculously simple but has been incredibly effective.  Trying to learn how to use the program took a few days but that is really a reflection of my ability to start a budget. Once I decided how I was going to operate month to month it all fell into."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpfull application for financial planning and management. What I like the most is that you can keep several subaccounts into your main account and rollover money easily in all of them. Having your transactions saved on their server is very useful if you have to wipe data from your phone as in a factory reset for example"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's the first time we've used anything like this and we're impressed. I love the syncing between devices, budgeting is easy and we've saved £100 extra this first month!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent money management system! The support is good too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the first time in my life I've been ankle to keep track of my spending! Excellent app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Going through a Dave Ramsey class and this is perfect for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great for keeping track of spending on by the go"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Awesome! Just too expensive for the extra features!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome product. It does just what I need. My husband and I are able to track expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It could be handy but it limits you to 10 expenses . If you want more you have to upgrade. Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Eeba is very convenient for envelope budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lots of features and accessibility!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app is a pain both 2 setup & 2 use.  There are much better budgeting apps available which are easier 2 setup & maintain,  free, & far more powerful.  Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great help on my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"great program"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Has various currencies, syncs on current devices. Has 20 envelopes in free version. Love that it can sync between phones, no matter what version of android it has. If you are looking for a home budget app.. this is it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works exactly as advertised"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!! For those wwho are serious about managing their finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is probably the easiest way to budget and track monthly budgets, keeping it simple was smart!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is a great app. I did have trouble getting started. But once I figure it out I plan to upgrade."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super simple & efficient"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps my husband and I know where the budget is at all times. Now I can stick to a budget without using cash for everything."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simply fantastic!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love using this app because it will sync between the wifes and my phone. This is the most useful app I have found I've been using it for 2 years and I love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wife and I been using this.  Its simple to use and does the job well. Just what we were looking for."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Can I change the currency to ZAR?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I couldn't even use the app it kept telling me my email and name where already used i changed them to all the emails i have had"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Could use an option for  percentage based envelopes and a feature to auto assign different pay sources to specific envelopes. Rate helpful if you agree :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I found it useful and easy to use. Filling up the envelopes     can be kind of tricky because of different methods."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Freaking awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good app for tracking ur money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect for our needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love recurring payment feature and ability to remember multiple envelope refills... more automated synching with banks and a calendar view of recurring payments and refills would boost rating to 5 stars"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"i have downloaded finance apps where you have to give your personal banking info, which you definitely shouldn't give out! This app you have the option to not give that info. My husband and I are able to update our spending habbits and see the charts through their online website. Best budget app ever! you can even see online the percentage of each specific budget you are spendin. very hepful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, helps alot with keeping the family finances in order. Would be even better if app/website would show you the balance of monthly money left in each of the envelopes when you are manually attempting to add money to each of the envelopes. As it stands now, I have to manually calculate how much money I have put in each envelope, and how much left I have budgeted to put in each envelope before the next period.   Otherwise, other small request is to be able to delete transactions from the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Definitely check it out online.   It has graphs and everything.  It has definitely helped me save some cash.  I only wish the free version kept records for longer than 12 months."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is worth every penny and I went for the Plus program at $50 a year.  My wife and I use this on a daily basis and have more than 30 envelopes to really line item out our budget.  After 1 month our spending habits have changed and we have put more money aside which instantly paid for the app. Use it to reach your financial goals and get out of debt and stay that way.  Note: To really make it effective set up auto payments and deductions for those small annoying envelops like ""internet"""
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"A good app normally will be easy to operate and understand but  this is not one of it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great and will hopefully help us get and stay on track with our budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that I can budget for once  a year items like the HOA fees and security monitoring. The ability to customize this makes it extremely user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Rocks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Would have given it 5 but a lit of times I have to use their website to make changes as the app won't update/save. Would not pay for app but can't beat the free version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps us on budget....and not bouncing anything.  Love this!!  I've had it since it was in Beta, and I'll likely keep it forever.	Keeps us on budget....and not bouncing anything.  Love this!!  I've had it since it was in Beta, and I'll likely keep it forever."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Have used this for a few months now and it seems to tick most of our boxes. A few minor faults such as initially a little complex to use and balancing across weeks is not particularly easy. But I suspect this is more low user IQ than a fault with the tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Difficult 2 use. I had to use fake #s to reload after each money. After I got used to manually restarting budget its OK."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and ingenious"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very stable app. Good visualisation of budget/funds."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lovin it so far..easy and works great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I think it needs a place to record how much I NEED to put in each envelope along with how much each envelope has. I need to know how much to save in each envelope each week AND how much each envelope currently has. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Use it daily!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping trackof expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I put money in envelopes, then record my transactions as they occur. It has been the absolute best answer to budgeting and tracking. The paid version will also track your bank account balances. I recommend most highly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We have probably tried dozen accounting programs. Between their errors and a lack of information none of them did a complete job. Worth every penny.  Can not recommend it highly enough"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Only thing that could make it better is if it was linked to my bank account and could build transactions off account transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I think its working."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love that hubby and I can sync phones and use the same login. That way we can monitor or gas, groceries and entertainment together"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps our fam stay on the same page when it comes to knowing where we are at with our budget every month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I really want this app to work but it seems to be super buggy. I change budgets and save the new amounts but when I enter a transaction, it still has the old budget figure so it seems me into the red."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This was exactly what I was looking for. So helpful in keeping us on our budget, I may even upgrade to their fee plans for more options. But even the free plan is so helpful.  And it's easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sorely needs an update from gingerbread to holo theme"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and intuitive"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent for keeping track"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I would give it a five star rating if you did not have to pay a monthly fee after buying it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this product for a while now am lost without it love it love it love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's very user friendly. I like the way it's designed with envelopes. It's better than other expense tracker application. I like that I can also set my savings in it. I like the built-in calculator. I don't have to go out of EEBA just to use a calculator. However, it would be more helpful if it has a grouping/parentheses for slightly complicated formula. But, I'm so happy that it has no advertisements. I would definitely recommend it to others."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is sooo easy to use and gives all the details that are needed to plan a simple expenses tracking... I am sooo happy with it I had to give a review. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app makes budgeting so easy and convenient!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app takes some work on your part to make sure that you keep income/expenses balanced with your bank acc, but it is definitely worth it. For the first time I'm not stressing about upcoming bills or unexpected payments- I can see where my money is, and what it is earmarked for. I even have savings now!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works good once you figure it out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This app would be much better if it would allow me to register! Now all it says is that my username and email already exist."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My only issue is it doesn't show how much you've spent in the envelope during the budget period."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would like to be able to add monthly envelopes for monthly bills even when you budget weekly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This budget app has been used by various members of our immediate family and extended family it helps keep you focused organized everyone should use it.  this has helped immensely in keeping us within budget and structured."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Will definitely help you get on track financially if you can show a little discipline of your own."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I'm sure this is a good app, hence 4 stars, but too complicated for my needs, uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Won't sync to server???"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Impossible to register a budget to use between phones. No matter how strange a name you enter it always says that name is already registered."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"EEBA is an awesome app that will help anyone who doesn't want to have several envelopes sitting around wth cash in them, but wants to use the same process for managing money. I would rather have seen an option to buy the app for a set cost rather than a subscription that includes a recurring cost, but seems like a good business strategy to set it up the way they did. As a result, I now have an envelope for my EEBA subscription. Well played, EEBA."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great program. Wish free version had more envelopes."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, though you cannot have weekly and montly payements, phone bills rents internet etc. are monthly but paychecks, groceries gas etc are weekly. Should be more customisable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Eeba"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Should have the daily expense show what we pay for  today."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Works great and has been a huge help in reaching my goals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Never had a technical glitz with it in about 2 years."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is my first month a little confusing. Envelopes good idea but not sure how to fill them or the restart of ech envelope. I had to start with main bills. Bills that aren't a set amount are hard to file. Overall I'm still learning."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Plenty o' goodness here."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am always wondering where my money goes. But with ebba I can track 'em and I can see how much money I have left without panicking! <3"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I have this app synced to both of our phones. It's so easy to record transactions and stay on track with our envelope system budget. I'd recommend this app to anyone with a smartphone!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple, convenient, useful!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The application Crashed down on its very first use on my Samsung Galaxy S2. No option to change currency. Have to live with dollars only."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, don't need a computer to update information like another program in the play store. Great for our envelope budget, right down to the penny."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Very easy app and also very efficient"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me stay on a budget. It has different ways of budgeting, monthly, weekly, etc. Also, it helps balance my accounts to ensure no one has used my account. Much better than mint that doesn't let you enter transactions."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA is the perfect tool for tracking our expenseson the go and for keeping my husband and I on the same page with our finances. It is customizable to our needs and unlike Mint/similar, it makes no assumptions. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The phone app could be easier to navigate like the website. Bit they sync. Also i wish there was a way to track monthly/weekly/etc budgets at same time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Downloadable spreadsheet, easy to read reports, excellent app that works without the need of internet access. Easy to use amazing sync with website etc. By the way I love the emotions in the envelops as my budget changes. :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"To be able to use envelope on the go...awesome..as with any new app...need to learn it to get most out of it..  a bit of trial and error ...once mastered  Completes the budgeting process.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Little confusing to set up but worth it when your done. Exactly what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I *love* this app! Totally helps my husband and I stay on the same page and make decisions based on our budget and control overspending! Would have given it 5 stars if the free version allowed more than 10 envelopes, but we are able to use it effectively even with that limitation."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"There are one or two little things that could be tweaked but overall there is nothing that works better than this for keeping to a budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Exactly what in was looking for"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeping track of spending is so easy with this app!!  It helps me stay true to budget commitments that support my financial goals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good program"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks to eeba i dont use cards anymore. I use cash. My wife and i are always on the same page because of eeba."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I budget every month but Im not great at tracking it so this is a huge help. Its great on the move to record as you go and the web page is great for an overview. An excellent app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome for keeping track of your money! Haven't had a problem with it and I know where my money goes all the time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely essential to taking control of your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I took my actual envelopes and transfered everything to this program. Now my system is mobile and managed by both my husband and I. We can sync wherever we are without the worry of managing and traveling with actual cash envelopes. I highly recomend. Only complaint is that the bank account isnt synced to eeba so I manually enter all expenses abd deposits, but that works for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been looking for an affordable, sync-able, envelope system... And found it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's helped our family get ahead financially. Thx ebba"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Seriously,  this thing allows me to keep a hawks eye on my money just amazing"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful tool for a couple to manage their finances. The sync feature is awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A little difficult to navigate through the settings, but I love how quick and easy it is to add transactions. The envelope icon's expressions change based on how much money I spend and it's really cute!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My fiancé and I use this app to keep track of our budget on a joint account. It's great that I can input an expenditure and the record will show up on his app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes what I did physically virtual. And does it easily."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best app for budgeting. I would have given it 4 stars but for the sheer fact that they don't infringe on my phone info, they earn 5 stars. A nicer UI would be nice. I wouldn't mind paying to use more envelopes, but not monthly.  :/"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I don't like apps that access my financial information (like mint) so managing my own finances in the traditional envelope system is ideal. This app does it perfectly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great for helping me budget without having to use cash and envelopes. Very nice app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome budget tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Dollars only."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love ebba cuz it stop me from over spending i totally LOVE IT."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple and exactly what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does what it's supposed to, I like the autosync with phone, tablet and website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am able to record and track my expenses easily both on my mobile phone and computer. The free version itself already provides everything that I need (except automatic scheduling of funds into individual envelopes)! If I need to add another user to my account, I would gladly pay the monthly fees for the premium version.   This app helps me organize my finances so well!  Thank you for creating this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has helped us tremendously!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm not a big fan of budgeting. But ebba makes it quick and painless.  The reports are a great plus especially for a free app.  I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this ap!!!  It has helped my family to get ahead!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple and well thought out."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Didn't allow more than 10 categories, uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budget helper"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keeps me on track with spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great upgrade from manually updating the totals directly on the envelopes. Now both my wife and I can see what's available from our own phone without having to digg out the envelopes.  The website application seems a little clunky. Much easier working directly on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Managing money is hard.  This makes it possible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app faithfully for almost a month. Love it!!! Easy to use, no bugs, and keeps me up to date on my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a terrific app. We use it every month!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best application I've came across with a clear interface and family sync. I would gladly pay for this application. Has all the functions we have needed so far. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app and how easy it is! I also like how u can go online and work on the budget :) Great app!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps us keep our budget on hand at all times. Super easy to use and reload accounts each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Especially for free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Budget App"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app. I like to key in all expenses at end of day. Would have been better if the transactions in the same day can be sorted manually"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track of expenses on phone. Difficult to set up on phone though. Had to set up on computer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"very useful for monthly budget planning"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, clean and functional. Very nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great, great way to keep the wife and I on the same page"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have used this app to keep on top of our budget and it has been very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This it's a great tool for helping stick to a budget. I'd like it more if I could more easily see total amount spent all together but I'm happy overall. I especially like how it advises when to stop spending for a few days to stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like this app, but I do wish it was a little more user friendly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use and works like a charm at keeping your money organized. The virtual envelopes have really helped me stay on track with my budget and financial goals!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA has some great features that allow you to easily add money to your accounts every 2 weeks or month and it is super fast to add in some transactions for purchases!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have no money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I think this is the best budget tool out there."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm a big budgeting freak, and this is the best (free) budget app I've ever used... Very easy to use and manage. The widget makes it even better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Looks good, but you can't buy it, only subscribe, and you need that to have recurring expenses.  That could be several hundred dollars over 5 years, and the cost will keep mounting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I am so glad that I found this app to keep track of my spending.  Although I loved Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace system, the paper envelopes were definitely not practical since I had to use my debit card for most purchases.  Now I easily stick to my budget every month.  Thank you for a great product."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It gives you 10 free envelopes in budget and 10 in annual/irregular. It is awesome you really don't need more than that."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Won't let me add money or folders crashes every time!! Please fix this!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps me keep track of all my spending. Before this app my fiancée and I were always scrambling to figure out where all our money went. Now we can see exactly where it goes and hell loss us to know where unnecessary money is being spent so we can try to change outgoing expenses . I have Droid wallet as well, but this app is so much user friendly. Very easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great app, but not suited to modern life where the expense AND income side fluctuate. Need something to track where money is coming from. Between 2 of us we have 5 sources of income in any week! None of which is fixed! Find a way to manage this and I will pay $$$ and be eternally grateful:-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need: helps me do an envelope budget as recommended by so many and still get credit card rewards."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I just use the basic envelop feature. Love the widget because its easy to access and add information. I also like that it remembers what stores belong to which envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great little app, a little complicated at first but very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love how two people can use the same envelopes and that it refills with or without rolling over.  Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great product and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It helps me save money for sure."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Would use it if could change to sterling, all apps made for dollars when not everyone uses them. Doesn't make sense"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its a great simple way to help budget. Strait forward and even suggests not spending for a calculated amount of days if you do happen to overspend :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome budget tool. A must for our family!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Galaxy nexus"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If you need something more complex, you're overthinking it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best ever...  If you could have charts and tables then that would make it 6 stars... ;)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Quick and simple to use and really helps you keep track of your spending and in control."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Ready east to set up budget, very flexable & useful. My wife & I can easily track expenses in real time & know what available funds are."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sad"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It works great with a family of four using the program over multi devices.  Tried using other budget programs before like Mint but always had issues sycn'ing and logging in.  This one is working to my expectations."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been using this program for quite some time now, love it.  It isn't perfect, there are things I would change if it were my project, but it's very good, the premise is simple and the interfaces, both phone and computer, have not been over complicated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"No matter what i changed my budget to it would always change it to something else and would say i planned to spend more than i make!!!! Grrrr annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Staying on budget is key to financial peace. EEBA makes it sooo much easier. Mint is not the same. Eeba is you telling your money where to go, Mint tells you where it went."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for this program, this is the most organized I have been in keeping track of my spending!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budgeting successfully for the first time!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We tried dozens of the budgeting software over the course of several years and have been using this for about 6 months. EEBA is the only apply that allows easy envelope style budgeting that allows me to see real time if I have the money allocated go the purchase I want to make.    My wife and I both have this installed so we can make sure the other person has not spent the gas or food budget before we make our purchase. Most family finance tools offer great tracking and reporting, but very terrible budgeting. Everything you need to do an easy family budget without the extra garbage.  I would recommend EEBA to everyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for a budgeting young adult couple trying to save.  I use it everyday. Simple and easy to use. Not unnecessarily complicated like similar applications."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really loving this envelope system of budgeting. Helps me keep track of bills and future expenses easily. Great program!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and makes it easier to keep close watch on finances."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly and great customer service. I have had 2 questions and both were answered promptly and correctly. Ready now to get on track in 2013"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Well well well. I nvr use envelop system before, glad to meet EEBA. Its kinda useful, and im sure itll get better later when i understand the regime more."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great tool."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This program has helped me get out of, and stay out of, debt.  Being able to go to the grocery store or a restaurant and know exactly how much money I can spend this month has saved me numerous times.  And it's free!   You guys are doing an awesome job, thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful application for simple tracking. My wife and I both have this app on our phones and it helps us communicate in real time how much money we have for each categorized envelope. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"First app I've found that allows for savings. Love that we can view spending charts and graphs online and sync to my husbands phone. Keeps us both honest with our spending and is helping us meet our goals."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good. A like others most but this one its avaliable on web browser so you can access from other devices. Free edition have limitations"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes the guesswork out of budgeting and bills for my husband and I. INVALUABLE!! And it is free!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Still plenty of room for improvement. Needs regular updates"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have already recommended this to several people. It is a great budgeting tool. Keeping actual envelopes and cash on hand doesn't work for me so this is perfect! All Dave Ramsey fans will love this!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a cool app..let's me see where my money is going"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA is awesome! Simple and fun to use!  Start saving money today!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This has really helped me with budgeting and using the envelope system without actually using envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA has helped my wife and me get on the same page with our budget.  It's much easier for her than Quicken or the spreadsheets I make."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been debt free since 2008 and still use the envelope system to keep my budget and save for a new car.  The ability to sync uour accounts between devices means that now instead of balancing my accounts and envelopes ounce a month I can enter expenses as they occur. That saves me a lot of time and frustration.   It also keeps me from splurging on little things when I can see where I am on my way to meeting my goals.  I wish it wasn't a monthly fee to do so but I hope I will find it well worth the money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the customizability of this utility. I have been able to take control of my discretionary spending by being aware of what I have spent and what I have left. Nice job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"really great app! if you are looking for a way to plan and track your budget, don't spend money on sophisticated softwares... eeba has all you need! really helped me to control my expenses and savings!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Everyone should use this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Does a great job of tracking expenses."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You can use it online, offline, synchronize between different devices, and across different platforms! Manage Envelops and accounts - for $5/month or $45/year! I WAS a commited Quicken loyalist, until they  trashed Pocket Quicken and wouldn't develop a suitable replacement. I've spent lots of money on Apps and software, but I don't trust cloud ONLY, nor do I want to have my information stuck on one device. This is the BEST solution, and the BEST customer service team!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has really helped me to stay on track financially!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Takes a little time and tinkering to get it just right, but its totally worth it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the ease and the detailed reports."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Using this app has saved me a lot of money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Could stand to be better looking, but it works and it's very useful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Would be great if in Sterling"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is frikking great it helps me month after month to keep track of my quids.. Get it now!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks for making a simple, no frills, not complicated budgeting system. It work terrific!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It's extremely useful for identifying funds and spending habits. The only thing I wish was on the app is a user friendly way to transfer  funds to envelopes on a smart phone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to monitor cash"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Finally I can stick to a budget with this app. I can track on the go instead of saving receipts to enter later. It really helps to see my what u have spent in relation to the day of the month. I love seeing how many days it would take to get back on track for the month. I can also transfer $ between envelopes when one type of expense is over budget. I like the reports that show me how my actual spending compares to my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This makes budget and marriage work together:)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use to keep tract of where $ is spent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting that much easier for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really what one ever needs to track their expenses and keep on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app may be perfect. I can sync and check on my budgets whenever necessary on my phone and the envelopes make sticking to my budget much easier. And being able to log into the website makes paying bills and balancing my checkbook much more manageable. First time I've ever been able to make a budget work for me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Hello Devs, Any chance for getting a new UI refresh to ICS standards?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's very easy to use very clean and smart approach to budgeting its just what I wanted"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best of all"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Force close"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I've been using this program for a short period of time and I really enjoy it. Having used excel from scratch or a pen and paper, I enjoy the digital difference. The con would be the cost, though cheap, could be cheaper. Also the program doesnt recognize monthly bills or bulk buying of groceries; therefore a sad or confused envelope staring at me suggesting I stop spending. Not everyone buys daily groceries, and making $1.38 utility payment everyday for a month would raise human eyebrows."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent application.  It is just what i was looking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been working on our budget since March of 2012 when we started leading Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University. We do a zero based budget just like Dave recommends but we don't use cash for many of our envelopes so we needed a way to have digital envelopes and after searching iTunes and Google Play EEBA was the best application we could find.   We pay for the premium version and it is worth every penny. The online interface is great as well. You need this incredible budgeting tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app to easily keep expenses tracked on the move. Best of all works to keep me on budget!   Well done and thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I can never get it to set the monthly beginning balances to the right amount"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app really helps you keep track of spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used Mint and loved it but the feature to sync across a family never materialized. This app lets us record payments and know where our money is going, all why syncing between the family phones. Fantastic!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I find this app extremely helpful with keeping me on a tight budget. It's easy to use on the go. Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Ive tried many apps....this is by far the best"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Could you make it show current envelope amounts in the add money screen to make it easier to figure out how to allocate the money? Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Hate making budgets but like this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app gives a great start to getting a budget started"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Envelope budgeting is the best way! I would recommend it to anyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app and the ability to sync it with my husband's phone too. I looked at lots of budgeting apps but most were overly complicated for just tracking day to day spending. The only drawback is that the menus for allocating budgets to the different envelopes doesn't seem intuitive to me but I've only been using it for a couple of weeks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best app I've seen for budgeting. The program can be q little rigid but does a great job connecting my family to one budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It seems to have trouble saving my changes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic - easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Havent had any problems with this app. It's very reliable and helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does what it says"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very short adjustment period and you are set to go. Love being able to sync with the online version."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"best app I found for budgeting in 5 years of searching.  Honestly love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had tried many ways to track my daily budget using notes, spreadsheet, etc. This EEBA has made it much easier. Very happy. It's free and working well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great application,  goes with Dave Ramsey envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've never been so much in control of my finances! thanks for this app guys at EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good app, but it's annoying how it seems to constantly sync. Wish it had an option to sync less often. But I still use it everyday. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and useful. Threw away my check book. Also the online Site is really good. Highly recommend"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love the way it remembers your info for future inputs. Going online is also a plus."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very nice how we can synch all our input on android phones that have the app. Ever considered having it for Blackberry, IPhone and Symbian?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This App allows you to set a budget for monthly and annual (irregular) expenditure. You can spend with confidence while this App keeps tabs on your spending. You know exactly where you are with your finances. I'll be a lifelong customer. Interface is appealing and intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use & works brilliantly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would like to see a ""bills"" section where you can edit the date the bill has to be paid. Also a note section in each envelope for important information particular to that envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very useful app we love it. Samsung S II"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for keeping a personal budget. So easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried others prior and after trying this one. It's detailed enough for a control freak like me, but simple enough for anyone, especially those visual-oriented peeps. Love it sooo much that I don't mind spending USD5/mth! Gd job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is simple and easy to use... u can share the same buget on two androids and  !!!!!! access it online... I'm in love wit this app [5stars]"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I highly recommend this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Sync doesn't work with my nexus7. Its always saying ""unable to sync  back to server"". Other than that I love the envelope idea. Great organizer."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super app. My wife and I share the account, and since we started using EEBA we have begun to understand budgeting.  We know where we stand,  no unwanted expenses and above all we are saving every month.  5 stars all d way."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me in budget!"

It is so nice to be able to view the various graphs that show our spending and where we need to tweek our budget. Help is always prompt in answering emails and even offer to help you on the phone if need be. We HIGHLY recommend this app for those who wish to keep an accurate budget and using the good old envelope system never fails, as long as you don't cheat!! No complaints on this one. Thanks"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to get input! Great overall picture of where I'm spending my money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Yay."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it ...nothing is better!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This gives us a great way to see our finances and know where we are at each month. I love not having a wallet full of receipts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I get confused by this app sometimes but it definitely helps me stay on budget. Sometimes adding money is tricky, not as intuitive as i want. Wish i could just type a balance into an envelope as an override but i have to allocate set funds."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this...so easy and so helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Retarded. The end. Stupid app seems to keep calculating everything on a monthly basis despite saying fortnightly....."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is probably the only way our family can successfully budget. We tried other programs before & this one beats the others hands down."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Awesome! It really helps me be smart with my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is a pretty good budgeting app. The website is not always very intuitive and I cannot add/transfer money between account on the app. I like that it does not make me give it access to my accounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Budget and Checking EASY!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wish I knew about this a long time ago. It's so easy to see where every penny goes and help make, and stay on budget."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app I've ever used"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Pretty good program but it's hard to figure out how to take things off or change them"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have tried many of the expense trackers and paid for the full versions. I have been using EEBA for over two years.   Unmatched ease of use and support , the right features and reports. Love it!!!!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using an excel file I created for the past 5 yrs to manage my budget. After 1 month with with this app I'm completly converted. This is easier, faster, and can be more accurate with minimal effort."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app on and off for about 15 months now and have enough of a history to truly track and predict my spending habits accurately, which is critical information for creating a working budget."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I seem to have issues each month when I want to refill my envelopes and it's also difficult for me to see at a glance how much I have left on my envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really helping me avoid impulse buys as I can always see how it would effect the rest of my budget. On the other hand I don't have to worry about the extra things I do buy - just transfer it out of food envelope to luxury item envelope!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome envelope program. Lets me track where I am through the month. Wish I could default no location (I usually add all expenses at the end of the day)."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Would love to see a signup option to share to 4 devices. Phone and tablet for me and phone and tablet for my wife. Only options are 2(free) 3(paid) or 10(paid) devices. Please make an option for 4. Outside of that it is awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Haven't had it long enough to give 5, but it's simple and does exactly what I need. If all goes well, I'll give it 5."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's the first budget that has ever worked for me. Simple to use and looking up the spreadsheets in the report section is a real eye opener to see exactly where my  money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"force closes everytime i try to add income"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I never knew where I was spending all my money... Now I can see the whole things and this app taught me to save a lot. Well Done!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I would give five stars if we could schedule an expense and I if we could also set a reminder for that."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love kinda reminds me of the old Microsoft money. Except it would be nice to have a future cash flow chart if you have deposits set up.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Now I control my money, my money doesn't control me!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"E Z to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This budget program has really helped me turned my finances around by helping me control spending. It is awesome how my wife and I can have up to the minute updated info on where our budget stands right on our phones.  We no longer have to ask and wonder where we stand we both know and it has helped us communicate about fincances easier.  I mean we accually do communicate now and make joint decisions, making the home life better too.  Entering stuff is a breeze with the mobile interface. The ablility to import bank transactions on their website to make sure all is reconciled is great.  The process is fast and painless.  Much easier than Quicken that I used to use.  My wife and I have had no issues with the app running on our Motorolla Droid X2 phones.  Update data transfer is fast.  It is helping me climb out of the financial hole I dug myself into!  Great job on the development."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keep up the good work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can finally keep on track with my wife. It is easier to see how our money works for us."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really like the ease of tracking expenses and the ability to have access to my budget at multiple locations  it's straightforward simple and very efficient at the time of a transaction.  One of the reasons I won't give it 5 stars is because I feel in the dark when it comes to wanting to know exactly how much I've spent in a particular envelope."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Uninstalling as this soon is too fussy for what I need. Just need a simple soon so I know where I am up to."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love, love, love... Next best thing would be actual envelopes in hand!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For the first time in a long time I didn't overspend. Mentally the envelopes were a huge help!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife has always lived on a check to check basis and didn't see the need for a budget. After getting her a smart phone I was able to show her how easy online banking could be. Shortly after she explored apps and found EEBA on her own. She brought it to my attention and now we are setting up our budget in detail and tracking every penny. For once I can actually show her how much toilet paper women really use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,":)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Recommended to DH already. DEVELOPERS: Keep supporting please!  :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you like envelope budgeting this is the best app out there.  No need to setup on the website or link to your bank.  Everything can be done from your device.  Auto syncs with other devices / spouse in real time."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We've been using the envelope system for months. I love this because it's automatic and we can see it on both our phones. No more carrying around paper envelopes or having to call the other person to see how much is left in that category! I do believe this app will really change how we handle our money. Thanks!!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Nice ui but assumes you are an elite American and does not support a second currency, overall easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice to see all expenses listed out with options for monthly/quarterly etc and see either a happy face at the end of it or face the fact that the takeaway budget has to be reduced!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy the great functionality and ease of use (compared to others like Mint) and I definitely enjoy the price (especially compared to others like You Need A Budget)! Only complaint is the lack of polish."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Nice ♥"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So it must be working great. Love the fact that you can share the same profile with your family."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I downloaded ALOT of free budget apps... this one is by far the best one. I wish that u could mark a budgetted amount of money (aka rent) as paid rather than just having it at zero. Otherwise  perfect app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works best with eebacanhelp website.  Not quite a standalone app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My only complaint is the lack of options for making non standard budgets (I.e. 3 months to save for a trip) or to transfer /distribute unused money each rollover. Maybe I just don't know how. Otherwise great! Been a month and I've saved hundreds!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"That about sums it up"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Especially like that have a household account and me and my partner are in synch. Thanks a lot Sheena"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A very useful app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works great, a little hard to reset envelopes every month"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent alternative to ynab or mint"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"A simple though versatile app. Has been helping me keep a budget, but you need to diligently update record yourself. Would be nice if it had syncing capabilites with banks, and more than 10 envelopes as these go fast."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App :D"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is the best tool I've found for budgeting day-to-day spending as it happens. There's no need to save receipts for entering later, just do it as you pay. Fantastic."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Great for a family household."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is simply the best budgeting app I have ever seen."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Use it every day. A very handy tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent! Been having trouble with recent release though"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been trying various budget methods for the past 10 years. This is by far the simplest and most intuitive I've seen yet. I love it! Visual learners will appreciate the simple visuals replacing strings of abstract numbers. I can get my very concrete mind around the concept of putting money into envelopes and then spending only what's in there!  I love this system and this app!  Great that my husband and I can sync - easier to stay accountable to each other."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"With this app I had a bit of a learning curve, but once I learned to use it I started to really like it and find it to ne very useful."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app and easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I liked the envelope idea, but not the idea of carrying the cash. I just couldn't do it. This app works great, once I figured out a few of the tricks with setting up envelopes and payments. If that had been a bit easier, I'd have given it 5 stars. But love it all the same."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"As advertised"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It seems like a good interface, however, I really just can't figure it out. I need to be able to add and remove money easily. Maybe with a few tweaks it will be better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little tricky to use but super helpful. The website helps a lot!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been doing envelope budgeting for two years and this app makes it a piece of cake to track how much I have without going through and writing it down to add up in an excel document later.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is a great tool for keeping my husband and myself on the same page with our finances.  It takes getting used to but is so worth it to have."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"But slow with a lot of transactions but excellent functionality."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the separate envelopes I just wish there was a way to have two separate budgets for the month on the same account as we have a bill check and a rent check. we get paid twice a month but each check has a different budget. And some of the items are split between checks so if I did one envelope for the month at $50 bu $30 was to come out of the first paycheck and $20 out of the second I would need to go back to our paper budget every time to remember how much out of which check when filling the envelope"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used to use real envelopes. This app has allowed me to share my budget with my partner, control our spending more rigorously and provide us with more insight on our spending habits. I now have my entire financial gameplan neatly contained in the palm of my hand. And the customer service and support is STELLAR!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I like the bar showing how much I have left to spend, but I can't undo any transactions and adding funds was not intuitive. Had to uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has totally changed the way we spend money. It's helped us save, too!  :)"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been quite a help in showing my daughter what a budget is and the ways she can spend or save her money. She's got her own envelope in the family budget and she keeps and eye on it all the time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We used it while on vacation. Allocated funds for food and gas and other travel expenses kept us on track and helped us monitor whether we'd need to transfer funds at our bank.  Thank you. Using it on DROID Bionic.  Perfect."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has made budgeting a breeze! I do wish though that there was a bill reminder feature."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"If I'd rated it in the first week I would have given it a low rating, because it takes a while to work it out. Once you settle in to it though, it's very useful. Previously used Droid Wallet, but it didn't work too well on an HD display. Glad I gave this the extra time. If you're having trouble, stick with it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I combined this with ""Debt Free Forever"" (a book) and it's perfect. Thanks for helping my family make sense of our money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"More than what I expected."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been using this one whole pay cycle and it really has made me think about how I spend my money!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing in the year 2012 that when so had a question about the app a REAL LIVE PERSON answered the phone and was PROFESSIONAL & HELPFUL!! The free app has a lot of great features but after todays experience I might consider an upgrade!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, keeps me on my budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"We only use envelopes for categories other than direct bill payments.  Syncing between phones is almost immediate.  Takes a bit to learn to use, but not overly complicated."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is prefect for helping us with our budget"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It us easy to use and very customizable  use it all the time my wife and I"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have downloaded so many apps looking for just this one."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"They have shown graphs in the video which are not there in the mobile App... Rest it does ok."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love it, so easy to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely AWESOME...Nothing better.  Can't remember what I did without it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's such an easy tool to use! I love how you can split a transaction into two different envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budgeting tool.. Love it!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well for what wep need. Could use a  way to track savings as well as expenses, though."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and flexable. very nicely done!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great App."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Love  it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful tells you where your money goes each month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the way this app stops me spending a full months wage in a week."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Crashed a lot on ics"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is for tracking monthly expenses, not just one time sinking funds. It does more than I need and took a little time to figure out. It will be cool if I can get my husband on board on his phone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So helpful in maintaining a budget! A little difficult to figure out, but once i mastered it, i fell in love!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have minimal training in accounting, and EEBA made accounting a little easier.  I might complain that the commands aren't always in the places I'd like them (able to click on an envelope to transfer money rather than go to the specific menu), but the pros outweigh the cons."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! the little envelope icon is cute and friendly, and the running totals per category help me make better purchasing decisions. Bravo!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I have been working on saving money and have tried other saving programs. I found this one the most suitable and really like how I can make new folders for other budgets. The customer service is great. Trust me you should get this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for sticking to the budget and still having the convenience of using the debit card! Definitely would recommend this to anyone."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love being able to see not only see how much money is left but also how much I should scale back if I've spent too much. Also, being forced to remember to enter transaction amounts manually is a great way to always be aware of your money :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if there was an option to set up automatic transactions like deposits(envelope fills) or mortgage/insurance payments etc. Other than that, great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is exactly what I was looking for as a shift from using Excel to track my spending.  Adding money could be more straight forward though and it would be nice to be able to actually arrange the order of the envelopes.  Overall a great app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps us up to date with our budget. Has always worked perfectly. Intuitive interface. Samsung captivate."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for budgeting portable so you can take out purchases as you do them"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Mostly works good, but slow!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeping the family on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helps me budget so I can still pay rent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect. Please consider making split amounts easier - tell me the amount left to allocate. The same needs to be done when defining the budget. App allows me to over allocate into envelopes and save biut it simply ignores the change because I have overallocated the amounts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, it should improve UI"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool, easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love it. I just wish the UK looked a bit better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can create custom envelopes and have them refill in a variety of ways."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Being able 2 quickly check on your budget without having 2 do math every time gives me confidence that I can pay my bills in full. It's a stress releaser."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Galaxy note running CM9. The widget doesn't scale properly on a custom layout, which is not an issue for most apps. I would like to see more flexibility with envelope budget periods, I.e. I would like to have several weekly, a few monthly, quarterly, and finally annually as opposed to being limited to a single budgeting period and annual envelopes. Occasionally the total in all envelopes doesn't refresh unless the app is restarted.  I highly recommend this app, especially if you are sharing a budget. Sync."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I think its pretty good."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it helps us to save heaps and we sync to each other's phones. So effective!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app...I have been using it for over a month now.. Works great :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This makes it so simple, I use it!  I commingle fixed & regular bills & expenses into envelops for categories like first-of & mid-month bills, allow a lump-sum budget for spending  like groceries/household & discretionary/disposable & sweep the rest into savings for annual & one-of-a-kind expenses.  That gives me just a couple envelopes to monitor my spending & it's so simple to quickly enter each purchase and, more importantly, evaluate it first. At last a hand-held budget tool that really works!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 3 weeks and it is helping immensely. Can't wait for my vacation this year!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its helping me pay off debt."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A great tool for helping us stick to our budget--EEBA keeps us honest!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Needs to be able to flag cleared transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Better than anything else I've used to budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it advertises. I can't find any fault in the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use and has helped me save for my wedding which I had struggled with before."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It can be a little confusing but overall a sweet app to have. Especially if you spend money like I do. LoL!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Title says it all. Makes it convenient to track expenses and see where money is going. Easiest way to stock to a budget, and great customer service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This helps me alot"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My husband and I use this to make sure we are both on track with the budget. I love how it updates right away. Just wish it had more envelopes.   - MichelleJ"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best app for budgeting on the market"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes keeping track of our Dave ramsey system so much easier!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"works well"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simply great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This has helped me identify where all my money is going! Thank you!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps us keep track of our categories!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA is the Best hands down 2 thumbs up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a great tool to help keep you and/or your household on track with your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works very well.  Thanks for all your hard work"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Eeba has helped me get on top of my budget and i absolutely love it. My only problem with it had been that you cannot have certain budgets set weekly and some set monthly. Other than that it is wonderful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Hope you make report content in this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use this instead of the cash envelope system. It was an easy transition and simple to use and keep up with."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It's helped us be a team for the first time in our marriage!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works well and does what I want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Always been intrigued by the envelope budgeting approach but didn't seem practical, especially for people who use credit cards primarily. EEBA is the answer! Sync between phones, online is great. No problems so far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keep me and my family on point"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, once you get the hang of it it really keeps your finances in order"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"...and it is free."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great budgeting tool! No more excuses :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of my expenses to the penny and it is always available at my finger tips. Thanks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had my envelopes up and running in no time.  My main need was to be able to keep track of multiple expenses each day and then send the details to my husband every week or two.  No more handwritten lists or worrying about misplaced receipts.  I access this on my laptop and was even able to install it on my Kindle Fire!  Works beautifully and I will be using it as a more complete budgeting system in the Fall!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I really love this budgeting app. It helps me budget for those irregular and just-in-case expenses so that when I look at wanting to spend money I know exactly what's really available, rather than what's still in my checking account.  I just wish I could edit my paycheck entries on my app instead of logging into the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I would probably be laying in a gutter somewhere if not for this thing.  Kudos."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that it updates my husbands phone!!! I've had it for a few weeks and continue to be impressed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is good stuff. Reminds me of QuikBudget for the Palm OS back in the late 90s. Now it's in colour and has cloud backup. 2 thumbs up!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Cool app. Easy to use and manage your budget plain and simple."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use it and it syncs from my android and my wife's iPhone. We spend a lot less and save for things more. It is really great that we stay in budget. The roll over and auto fill features are great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Not perfect but the best there is."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is the best in its class...a must have"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Works very nice to keep track of expences.Only additive I personally would like to see is the posability to make a photo of the reciept,and add this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for quite a while and love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. I am now truly in control of my finances and I am even saving more money than I did before!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It just works well for me everyday."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app!! Makes budgeting easy! So nice to have all your budget info a click away. Fun to use, too!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love using this. Use it daily to track spending from budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy enough for a 19 year old to use. Great way to start an amazing habit. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I have a razy strict budget and eeba helps me keep a handle on things when I'm away from my PC. I use it on my phone Sony Ericsson x10 mini pro and have had no problems in the months I've been using it. Just got archos Gen tablet and eeba works like a dream on it. I'd love to see some feature which would allow me to edit the current funds in the envelope without me having to make a transaction but otherwise its the best app ever. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has everything you need, takes 10 to load a new expense to it.  Now if only it could actually stop me physically from spending..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It helps me keep track of the money I don't have. Reminds me of my great grandmother's method. Old school!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best budget app ever. I used it for a year.  First time I could do electronic envalopes and make it work!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I know why i always end up broke now lol"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great and really easy to use. Even my financial illiterate wife can use it easily"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember that money is set aside for something else."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. Thank you so much for having a black background instead if white! My wife uses it on her iPhone, I use on ny One X. Works perfectly!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what my wife and I needed to get money organized."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is way awesome! I can now keep a current budget with me at all times."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has all the features I need to keep me on track with my household budget.  I love the separate style regular and annual envelopes and how it helps you set the budget up in the first place, including how much you need to put away  each paycheck to reach your annual goals (like Christmas and taxes)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that my husband and I can both gain access to this even when we are not together. Helps us stay on track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks to this app I' m saving a lot of money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried a lot of different budgeting apps but this one takes out all the smoke-and-mirrors and puts you in control of managing your budget. I recommend it highly for anyone starting a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been through a lot of budgeting apps and this is by far the easiest and best. Highly recommend."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Cant belive its free!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping a budget easier by helping to track spending.  Highly recommended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Used mint and others but this is by far the easiest. It makes budgeting like a game"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app, great for people on a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy and powerful way to keep track of where all of our money is going. I love how it syncs from my devices to the web and back again.  That way I can enter things quickly on the device, but use the website for bigger things like viewing reports and setting up budgets. And scheduled transactions are awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It is easy to use and I really like the visual the graph provides."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Eeba is awesome!  I've been trying to budget before, but always failed. Having it right here on my phone makes it so easy!  It took me a little while to figure everything out, but now its so easy to put money in and take it out. It really makes you think, and be able to see where your money is going!  Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Yeah! No more messing with spreadsheets, just what I was looking for in an app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what my wife and I needed to stay on the same page with our budget. We tried physical envelopes but one of us would always need the envelope when the other had it. This allows both of us full access to the envelopes and we both always know how much is in them. Entering your purchases provides a more active budgeting approach than waiting for your bank to process the transaction."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting for a multi-income self employed household a snap. Very easy to use, sync between multiple phones & laptop is flawless. Cashflow is so easy to track now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for decent budgeting software."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app because it forces you to delegate money to categories ""every time"" you spend it....unlike a checkbook register where there's lots of room for error. The interface on my smartphone works just as good as the web based version. My only recommendation it that they enhance ""the design"" of the web and smartphone versions because there is always room for improvement. Add some variation of color...there is too much green everywhere! LOL"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great in helping me budget and sticking to it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this one for a year. Its great and flexible."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is great for envelopes on the go. Very easy to use and you don't have to keep up with cash in actual envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes managing a shared budget extremely easy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very responsive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Best feature is that multiple people can use the same account and it automatically updates each others spending"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It has been so helpful to be able to up date my envelopes and keep organized.  This program is very user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, easy to keep to"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very usefull. Found this app and haven't looked back since."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app rocks!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Solid app that works well. My only complaint is that it can take a while for my partner's purchases to display on my phone and vice versa."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! It keeps us under budget and on top of our savings goals. I love the weekly budget option,  too.  Thank you for making this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couldn't be more pleased."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great budget tool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome APP, we keep improving the way we use it daily, every month we find a more innovative and easy way to budget with EEBA, like this week we opened a new envelope called Reimbursements which helps us track what our actual expenses are vs those which we recover back,  I also use another envelope for addition of money during the month separately (instead of adding to the expense envelope) as it allows me to track what is my expense vs budget and actual overrun clearly, this seems to be better than adding money to an existing envelope which will deny us that visibility of what is the actual over run amount.  Now we do weekly reconciliations of what is in our hand and what is in the bank and savings to the penny. It feels so good to tally to the last penny.  EEBA has helped me start with budgeting and takeoff on this process very easily, Within two months we are experts at budgeting now.  Thanks a bunch Naveen"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Anyone who loves ""To Debt do us Part"" will love this app.  It's Gayle's jar method for real life, since using cash is just annoying."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helps keep me within my budget and save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I guess I don't understand how to show that i've  made a payment with saying its negative money and set up my envelopes to be paid by certain dates."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I use this daily and it's a very helpful finance tool. Would be nice if you can keep amounts unallocated on the app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love having a simple app that my husband and I can sync to each other. Very nice!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My wife and I love this. The interface could be better, and the lack of background sync has messed us up, but otherwise great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is an excellent budgeting app - in my opinion, the best of what's currently out there.  I like to plan how I'm going to spend my money down to a cent (or whatever the smallest denomination is). Sometimes, however, that's not possible in a monthly budget. That's what makes EEBA's annual/irregular envelopes so great. However, sometimes I want to make some smaller scale purchase which doesn't exactly make my monthly budget happy, and a year from now is just too late (and sometimes too early). It would be nice if I could define, besides how much I want to put in an envelope, how *long* I want this to take. Despite that these envelopes are annual/*irregular*, there's just no way to define that yet. I assume (and hope) they mean to add it in future, at which time I'll be happy to change this to a 5-star rating."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It took a bit to get used to, bit once I got the hang of if -it keeps is on track.   Now there is extra funds available.           Kit  Keep up the good work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Helps me know where my money goes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"really works great keeps my wife and I on the same page"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very handy tool, easy to use once you get the hang of it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This product is easy and effective"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes budgeting easy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I wasn't thrilled about paying for this but it's well worth it. Does exactly what I want."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This has been very helpful with budgeting and tracking expenses. I have had no technical difficulties. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it is a bit difficult at first to navigate especially adding unexpected funds to an already created budget. But aside from that it has been fantastic!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"LOVE this program! We have paid off all our debt using it to manage our money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and understand. Now to stock to my budget..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app works awesome! We can sync it between mine and my husbands phone. Only thing, I wish there were more envelopes I'm the free app, but I guess that's how they get you to buy it! :) We love it, and it's better than any other budget app we have tried. I like that the monthly envelopes will calculate the days this month and show you if you are ahead or behind based on the day, and how much money you have spent out of the category! It helps so I don't run out of money b4 the end of the month. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very helpful and user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has helped me 2 organize & minimize my spending habit. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use; the emoticons envelopes inspire me to stay on budget. Gotta keep em happy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great apps!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Sad... Force closes.boooo"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried them all and this service is the simplest way to effectively share and maintain a budget ... web, mobile web, Android ... these people KNOW what real envelope budgeting in todays world means....thanks a ton!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"If you're a Dave Ramsey fan you will love this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very nice program!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has transformed the way our family manage our money. Fantastic."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"functional and gets the job done!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and  I use this app daily!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"From overspending"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. I really love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has been such a great way to quickly track my budget and know just where I am in it. I didn't go over, had extra money to treat myself. It did take me a couple tries to figure out to get started so don't give up.watch the tutorials."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"This app did not make sense to me. Will not let you delete entries. Uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Valuable"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It really helps!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps me and my wife budget together."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over a year with no issues.  Nice job!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is a great app as it is easy to use."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Unfortunately more envelopes cost more money and some wicked features cost quite a hefty monthly price!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Won't open"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My wife and I can both login to the app on our own phones which is awesome. We haven't saved any money in the past two years but since using the app in the last three weeks we've reduced spending and are saving for a trip for the family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. I've yet to encounter a single glitch, bug, or error. Droid eris, Droid 4 and rezound :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is the best app I've found so far except I haven't figured out how to set up a recurring budget of expenses. I'm having to set it all up every single month. Pain!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I like it because it syncs with multiple devices!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little tricky to get used to, and requires discipline to make it routine, but once you do it really helps keep all your expenditure in perspective, and thus save you money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app took me a while to work out. Perhaps I'm dumb but once I had decided our budget, it came in to its own. Brilliant. Our household uses it all the time, not sure how i spent money without it before!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The app and website is great im able to see just how I can put my money just where it needs to be. But trying to keep up I need more time to break my spending habit lol. Use app for about two weeks now and I think June I will really stick to my budget. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and i were taking the dave ramsey financial peace university class, making our first budgets as a couple and trying to access where our monthly incomes were going. Dave recommends the envelope system as a way to not overspend in any budgetary category, but how much do you put in each budgetary category? Our solution was to use EEBA for a month, tracking expenses, calibrate to the budget, then use it on an on-going basis to help us stick to the budget. Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Useful tool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app does everything I need it to perfectly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wish there was a widget that could show the envelope balances, otherwise, it's even better than the web interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hella confusing. I'm better off making an Excel Spreadsheet than using this."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Me and my wife love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and intuitive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Once you get your head around the settings real good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to stay on budget and keep both my self and ny husband up to date on our accounts!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Love the widget."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, syncs fast, and very helpful!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very simple and effective! Esp like the ability to share information with family."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can't say enough about eeba.  This service offers complete transparency to all your bank accounts and credit card.  Completely worth the fee, never have to argue about where the money is going.  Simple to establish and keep to a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"My only complaint is they need to give the free version a bit more access to some of the pay options.  It works so well that I want to upgrade but really want test out a bit more first."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and clear to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Having a simple and easy to use tool on my phone is helping me be cognizant and responsible in my spending habits. Thanks for a really good free app"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and update, just what i needed"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Free and simple to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I don't use all the available features, but this is an easy way to keep tabs on monthly spending. I frequently enter purchases on my way out of the store."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very happy"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I can now find money in my budget to pay for midget hookers and donkey shows!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice to have some more  features like better control of scheduled transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My Husband and I both love it.. Its amazing.. Very motivative, if you want to watch your spending and make some savings :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a budget!  I love 'seeing' where our money goes and the layout is wonderful! Been using it for 4 months now!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It is a money saver (should I have said a life saver).. great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's just what we needed, something simple we could both access."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"works perfect, nothing to say about it but, use it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic easy and powerful"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works on Droid and iPhone"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It's has a 30 limit, not going to was time testing it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We use this to keep track of the family budget. Very easy to use!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app to keep you in budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Helps tremendously! HTC EVO 4G."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used to use mint but never was able to keep track of a monthly budget because all my accounts updated differently. This lets me decide what to keep track of"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Its everything I was looking for in a budget app.  I can sync with my wife's phone.  The only way it could be better is if it could read my mind so I didn't forget to enter transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Needs to change with the day of the month."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"very easy to use application. Needs better interface but is still usable at the moment"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Its a ltitle confusing at first with all the files, distribution options, and payments. but helps me once you get it organized properly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Especially when I use it ;-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I want to take this app behind the high school and get it pregnant.   It is that good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has really helped me manage my budget and it doesn't take much time at all to record my expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helps me stay on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easiest system I have ever tried"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Trying to figure it out is fun. Getting it to show actual money, working on it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I used to use the envelope system but going to the bank everytime you get paid gets old. This is a perfect balance between old and new for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Interface needs work. This is after two tries to work it out. Making some way to get back to the overview screen ever after the first run might be a good start."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great tool!  Helps keep me focused and on track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It's like a check register on your phone. Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"App isn't user friendly and complicated to understand"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It would be nice if it had more envelopes but I just used annual envelopes for things like insurance. And it fit my needs"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use this to track our individual budgets."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is one of my favorite apps."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA is just like a budget app that I built for myself, except way, way, way better."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It would be nice to have the option for some envelopes to be once a month and others to be every two weeks, but its a great app. Has definitely kept me from overdrafting lol"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great tool! Helps multiple family members follow a real time budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I love that it can sync between phones so my husband and I can easily keep track of our spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We used to do physical envelops, now this is easyfor both to have a synchronized budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Couldn't manage without this app anymore. Keeps me completely in control"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"love this app!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"An app that works!!!!  Helps me stay  on budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I finally have found a system and app that simply does the job without the fluff. Great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and organized!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for a family on budget. It allows you and ur spouse to always know what is available and what has been spent!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wish I was as good at budgeting as EEBA is!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Amazing hibh"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app is great for teaching kids how to manage money"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Unintrusive free and very easy!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I do the financial peace.  I like setting aside money for bills and things I buy with debit card using these electronic envelopes.   With the reports you can also see where your money went as well.  Very nice."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sure clears up my financial picture."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So very convenient. I have been looking for something like this for some time, this is perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Thanks guys! Now my wife can track every penny I spend! .....I h8 u."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great program for coordinating family budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Not clutteted with frosting. Thank you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"LOVE that more than one person can access an account. We organize and plan our budgeting on spreadsheet, but we really needed to an app like this to instantly let us know what the other was spending on food and extras. This is really helping us keep to budget. NOT 100% - needs a way to tag who's purchased what and get a total of what each person has spent (manual entry of who as I often add my spouses purchases and vis-versa. - also not sure on the workings of the auto-fill. Only gone through once and it messed up. We shall see.  Other than that, this is great! Thanks EBBA!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps keep me in check."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Good too have"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works well for tracking separate debt categories within one account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Limit of 10 envelopes unless you upgrade on the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like this idea of digital envelope tracking because I prefer to use my debit card rather than carry around a lot of cash in envelopes. But you really need to have a grip on your budget for this to be useful. I found it a bit difficult, personally, to stick to it without knowing how much is in the bank. Perhaps a feature to enter a bank balance and then subtract from that every transaction. One feature I loved was the synchronization between devices so you and your partner are on the same page financially."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy for my for my wife and me to be on the same page when it comes to keeping track of expenditures. I use it only for tracking main envelope type of accounts (e.g. gas, groceries, eating out, entertainment). I incorporate this info into YNAB for full budgeting."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really like this app because it is easy to use, and it syncs to two phones so my wife and I always are on the same page with our spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"This is a great app but it's not very user friendly. It needs to have the ability to enter upcoming bills and dates due for envelope planning, and it needs the ability to mark transactions as cleared/uncleared so you can see your true account balances. Other than that, it'll do for now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"April"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Does not calculate correctly"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It works for my family, when nothing else has!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like the app but I wish it was a little more intuitive. I do my budget on excel and I just need a way to track whatever I budgeted for the week in my categories. You should be able to lo g press an envelope and easily change budgeted amount, balance,name, transfer to another envelope..etc.   But it works exactly as the creators intended."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Doesnt miss any feature. And doesnt have extra (garbage) features."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great for couples that use the same account to avoid overdrafts."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Fail"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been trying to live on an envelope-based budget for several years, and we did okay...off and on.  With EEBA, we are finally able to stick to the budget, and it is really starting to show.  It did take a while for me to figure out how to incorporate our two, biweekly paychecks into one monthly budget, but once I figured that out, things smoothed out considerably.    As others have commented, the app is not quite as polished or intuitive as it could be, but it works.  And, the developers are constantly improving the program, both on the app and online.  The customer support for EEBA is by far the best I have received for any software that I can think of.  Support is limited to a support forum, but the devs respond quickly and with helpful suggestions.  If they can't help with your specific issue, they look into ways to fix the app around your problem.  Give EEBA some time, and you'll end up wondering how you did without.  On a side note, for anyone trying to put together a cash-based envelope budget, I have found that the plastic, accordian-style note card file holders make great cash envelopes."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is a well thought out app that abides by the philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well. The real beauty lies in its simplicity. Being held accountable for every penny spent has made me much more aware of where my money is going and how much money I actually have to spend. Thanks guys and keep up the good work."

I do too much in the way of electronic payments have for years. Carrying around a big cash envelope system wouldn't work for me. BUT, THIS APP FITS THE NEED PERFECTLY!

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love this app.  I would be awesome if you could include a savings tracker as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderful program, helps me track my spending money, but without having to carry hundreds in cash around with me."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I wanted and thought this was some thing simple by the way they describe out. I want to edit easily and see my total all together... This shouldn't be a hassle to look at our edit. I guess it works for others but this is way to advanced for the simplicity i need.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app, and good for anyone who needs to learn how to save money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"The only way I have ever managed to stay on a budget was by using the envelope system. Now that I use a debit card for everything those envelopes don't work and cash spends faster than it use to :) plus I'm uncomfortable carrying it around. This marries them together and I think it is better and easier!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So much more practical (and safer) than paper envelopes in this, the age of debit cards. My husband and I can both see live information so even if we are not at the same place at the same time we both have access to all of the ""envelope"" funds.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful. Better than MINT in my opinion. More simplr"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My problem with budgeting software was that it always took forever to set up and was time consuming to enter each transaction. Might be worth it for a business, but for your average person that just needs a quick and easy way to keep track of where the money goes, EEBA is definitely the way to go! I can enter transactions the moment they happen so I don't have to worry about forgetting or losing receipts. It only takes about 20 seconds. I'm sticking with a budget for the first time in my life and I love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love that it sync btwn me and my husbands phone. This makes the ""cash envelope"" system so much easier! The only trick is to remember to update it :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has made it easy for me to track my budget and stay on. Just the peace of mind knowing what I have and where I sit is amazing! Thank you!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I have really enjoyed eeba. This has help my wife and I stay on budget. Started with the ""lite"" version then after about 6 months went up one step. WOW, all the better. Takes some getting use to but when you figure out the phone along with the computer you will never want to anything different. I gave 4 stars only because there is more things that could be incorporated or programmed different. Great job, keep up the work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"It really is a great app, especially if you input your expenses on a daily basis.  The only thing I could see about making this app better would be in the transactions section, to put in the amount of money you have left over.  Great app though, I use it everyday !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use. First time in many years my family has been able to stick on a budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely wonderful. Exactly what i was looking for simple straightforward and easy. Thanks so much! You've saved my financial life."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great at keeping a household budget! We love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works beautifully. Fantastic UI!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For the last 18 years we've sworn we were going to make a budget and stick to it, but never have. I was about to start using the cash envelope system - which would be highly inconvenient - when I found this app. It couldn't be easier to set up, and now we are very much aware of what we are spending. Thank you so much! We've already got many of our friends using it as well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Great for keeping track of finances, shame you have to buy the full version to use it fully."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app to track your expenses!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The free version is too limited for me to even effectively test the product. I'm sorry, but I'm not going spend the time and money banking on the hope this will be worth my added trouble and expense (to the tune of 5.00 a month), without even testing the product (not enough envelopes) .If I could get a free trial for a couple months to test the product, I could maybe put a valuation to it, but I'm not going out on a limb and spend my money for an unproven service."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"It makes budgeting so easy. I use it to keep track of my variable expenses. Whenever I buy something, I can enter it right away instead of hanging onto receipts and entering them later. The widget is great too because it lets you save your location along with the amount spent. So whenever I'm at my regular coffee shop, I can enter the cost of my daily coffee with just a couple of taps. I'm a pretty experienced budgeter, but this app has helped me get an even better handle on my finances. A+!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Subscription?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"super simple and effective.  the expression on the envelope mascot's face is all I need to know the health of my budget!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome. I use it daily and have never had an issue. The online sync works"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Has everything i had wanted. Only con is it does not have monthly remaining if you use irregular expense envelopes but iphone app does."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wife and I use it all the time. So slick and cross platform."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I actually feel like I have control of my money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With the quick record widget it makes it easy to track spending. I think is the most important part of a working budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I have tried other apps for bills and management of income. This site is good but it can be confusing as most adjustments must be made on the website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"You have to be dedicated to using the envelope system of budgeting in order to get the most out of this app.  If you are, then IMHO you need this!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get a hang of it, it will be the best apps you have ever downloaded!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is the best app ever and has allowed me and my husband to collaboratively keep an eye on our budget! Just recording everything we spend has made us spend less!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Two of the feature i've been looking for...i asked Easymoney and they didn't want to incorporate rollover in their app...their loss."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helps my husband and I stay on track... Which can be hard with debit cards... This has really helped us!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Takes a minute to figure out but then its cool. I can sync it with my boyfriends so we can both see what each other is doing. It's helped out a lot."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to work with and worth having."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I had tried and uninstalled several $ management apps before I stumbled across EEBA. Love it! The envelope concept really keeps me track."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The more I use it the more I like it. It has some great capabilities and tracks our expenses very easily."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"That's the only app on my home screen. It is so quick to save expenses, I can be offline and it syncs as soon as I get online, I can order the envelopes specific for this device,...  So many great features!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Have been searching for a budget management app for a while! Found this to be perfect. :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Simple tracking"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I use the same account so we can have an instant look at our budget, no matter who spends the money. It is only as good as you are willing to put your expenses into it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"The subscription fee is so expensive. The free version is limited (only 10 folders), nearly unusable. I might pay $3 as a one-time fee, not $30 per year. Who buying a budget management program would pay this?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped mr to keep my money in line! Not to mention, I can synchronize my transactions with my pc!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little confusing at first but overall good app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Useful and favorite app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"It does allow me to track my spending under the transaction tab but the envelopes section is confusing to me I enter an amount and the full amt is not placed in that envelope"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use, highly recommend"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has helped me keep a tight reign on my budget. Easy  to use."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have been able to take control of my money for the first time! Not only that, my family can see where we're at and control their urges to buy."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"The best budget software I have used ad it is simple easy and efficient. Especially as my wife and I both can update it simultaneously and separately"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Uninstalled. Didn't find it user friendly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use.  Its so nice to know how I'm doing on my budget with a push of a button on my phone.  I highly recommend eeba"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been doing the envelope system with a computer program for the past 7 years and the hardest part is remembering to enter your receipts at the computer and knowing how much is in your envelopes while you are shopping. That is the genius of this service. Your envelopes are ALWAYS with you, you enter your expenses at the point-of-sale and all your devices are automatically synced. You have to be committed to the system for this to work. I'm a huge believer. Thanks EEBA!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wish I had this since 2007! This would've saved me *a lot* of money."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Really confused. Looks like a great app but do you start with money in envelopes that you take out when you buy/pay things or pay into them? I.e. Monthly budget for food is $600 so if i spend $200 does the envelope now have $400 or $200 in it?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"With eeba i actually know what is in my envelopes while i'm shopping.  Brilliant program!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very usefull in budgeting my money. I use it more as a money tracker but the budget portion lets me know if i am going to be able to make my payments"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I wanted. The best app and all of them for free without any add.. excellent."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I love this.  After years of using Exel and looking for a budgeting system that worked we found this one.  We have tried many of them that are out there.  This one is smooth.  I even like having to show accountability by recording each expense.  We love that it doesn't require private information.  It is simple - and that is how an effective budget  works successfully for us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Everybody should be on a budget...and everybody on a budget should have this app!!! Works GREAT keeping information synced!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"No BS. Does what its supposed to and does it extremely well. The free version will suffice for most. The paid services are ridiculously expensive."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Little bit of practice and you can master it.  Keeps me on budget, well most of the time. ;)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app I hate doing budgets but this made it so painless. I had trouble setting up my credit cards and the support responded within an hour"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"BUGGY. Transactions vanish. One option (monthly, weekly, bi-weekly) for all ""envelopes"", or an ""irregular"". I need 1 bi-weekly & 1 monthly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"A little clunky, not totally intuitive, but functional after a little practice."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Works great for the whole family.  I can really track our expenses much easier."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"WOW! Tried several budgetting tools - none have given me as much control over my day to day spending as EEBA has! I'm in control now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"does not reset each week, auto or manual. useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple to use! Great money tracker."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Live this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My wife and I were using mint to budget previously. It  worked ok, but it honestly seemed like too many features which complicated everything and was error prone. After  switching to this system, everything just makes more sense. We now adhere to a strict budget and are well on our way to being debt free. :)"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"We love EBBA! I love being able to enter expenses so quickly on the go, and that it syncs instantly with my husbands phone."

The additional account tracker you can get when you pay for a premium membership makes balancing checking accounts a breeze.  I have yet to experience anything negative.  No glitches or bugs that I've seen yet."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has managed to keep a married couple of overspenders on budget after a short period of time. We're on track and argue a lot less, (over money anyway LOL)"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Slightly tricky to learn, but very much worth it."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Tries to brain-wash you into paying monthly fees & that it can do budgeting better then simple cash flow/future cash flow models!  ** Problems: (1) 4-week budgeting option since MOST PEOPLE GET PAID EVERY TWO WEEKS AND A MONTHLY BUDGET IS USELESS!! We the ""normal""  and sane people need to *** SYNCHRONIZE*** OUR PAY AND OUR EXPENSES! (2) Cannot see/track account balances without paying. (3) Cannot plan properly because it is not date-based but ""envelope"" based. (4) Has no income screens, only expenses."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Bad app hard too manage money, because u can track ur expense, and spending"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app every day since one year, it works extremely well! Never had any single problem with it. I recommend it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. My wife has an Iphone and I have an android phone. Now that there is an Iphone app, things are so simple. We can stay on track with our budget, and know exactly what we have to spend at any given time. 5 STARS"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Nice app any chance of adding other currency as we are in UK but having to use $ sign rather than £ ."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I was concerned the app was gone. However, customer support responded asap and advised me it was only maintenance issue. Great support-Great app!!!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Keeps everything organized and paper less! Droid X2"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fixed my rampant spending. Now if you could make a better looking widget (re: transparency) it would be great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Very nice free program. Needs more options and envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Superb app. Totally clean and good to use. Can we have option to refill individual envelopes for a pre set value instead of all at once??"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"One of the most helpful apps I have ever used! Very easy to navigate and understand."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This is a very handy app. One addition that would be nice is the ability to reset envelopes via mobile, which is only limited to the web right now."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I like that I can sync with my husbands phone. Use it for our checking account instead of the paper register."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It is simple to use and provides an instant look at what you have spent. And how much is left in your budget. Great response!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Yank dollars only and you have to pay for full feature.. total crap"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I thought this app had a widget?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"App is helpful with budget and very easy to use. 10 envelopes is plenty. Some people are always looking for a reason to complain but app is awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Says I already have an account but can't retrieve family name"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love the App very much. Now this App guides me in spending the money, and i really loves the idea of envelopes. This App and its Website is really great because of its simple and neat UI. The developer is very quick to respond to requests, and therefore giving 5 Star rating, because if we face a problem with this App the developer will definitely help us."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Me and my wife love this app. Love being able to synce on two phones, but don't always get paid the same. Still awesome."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. One problem though, after two factory resets I have login to site and delete logins. Should detect it is the same phone and not a new one."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"just what we were looking for. It's not perfect in every way but wife and I can use our phones and capture every expense then review at night online."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Access via app, mobile web page or full web page. Saves on the cloud and shares easy with multiple users so everyone can be on the same page financially.

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed, love the widget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Once you get used to this app it's just perfect to keep track of your expenses. Just what I needed!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Ugly and hard to use. Must read a lot of stuff before start using it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using this for about 6 months. Works great, best thing about this app is able to sync with husbands phone...no more over draws"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Its a cute app but its basically pointless until it can actually sync with true accounting software."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Has saved me thousands of rands just by allowing me to track where my money goes! How about making a tablet optimised version?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"T just дьрша д. Kdd,him Zooms-d J..gov"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Dont like the fact that u need to register... it shouldn't be necessary."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app but would love the option to export expenses in qif format."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it. Use it everyday."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple but extremely useful tool. I especially like that multiple devices can access the same account, so my wife and I can budget together."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Stumbled into this app and LOVE it! It does exactly what I need it to. No more notebook in my bag and me struggling to keep it balanced. BEST APP!!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Fab app! If you like to put money in pots like I do, this is a great way of using a debit or credit card but still being in control of your spending."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Super cool!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Good working.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Luv the evelopes.. Need more features...."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Took a while to get right, and it doesnt go to your actual account, but its gonna work."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"difficult to use"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Lets us use the envelope budgeting method easily - without cash. Plus, my husband says that seeing sad envelope faces makes him not want to cheat! :-)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not for me"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Cool app just not what I needed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using EEBA for two months now. Love it so far. Upgraded to the premium to get account features has also been great."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Was stupid"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This app has been invaluable and has saved me so much! I have yet to use any advanced features. I can't imagine anything better*"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly easy to use! You don't have to learn every little thing about it to just get up and running."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The best feature is the simple fact that you see how many days you're behind on your budget. This puts my spending into context!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sync 2 devices is brilliant. Both stay tuned into daily spending without talking about it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"This app is useful for people who need budgeting money, easy to use, simple yet understandable interface."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track. Very good app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"You could make your own in an Excel format with less hassle/more privacy. The key to the envelope system is using cash cause it is harder to give up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It does fine tracking the budget balance if your pay and budget r on the same sched. Sucks trying to make anything else work. Premature release..."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really useful app. I love it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Loving it. Really easy to use and record transactions and love being able to sync with hubby."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've been using the soooooooo app for a while and have found it extremely helpful. I've heard of a complaint about spam, but have not received any."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I vote EEBA as best app for Android. I once used quicken, but I've been using EEBA for a year! And, they don't spam you."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I am a bookkeeper & this is way overly complicated for personal finances! WTF is w/ all these envelopes, just show me my expenses & my income! DELETED"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Been using for five weeks now and it had been a lifesaver!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"@rino your talking crapola! using this app for over a year Use it every single day never! had spam, can honestly say EEBA has changed my LIFE!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Never spammed, so don't know what that is about? If your accounts don't match, your doing it wrong."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It does no more or less than my wife and I need to corrolate our joint budgeting. Have told all my friends about this. Best app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"After the last update, everything went haywire. Uninstalled"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too hard to use, email got spammed."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I've tried most of the budget apps in the market, and this is the best one by far."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I really love this app, a must-to-have in your Droid"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, so good at keeping track of spending. Many thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"wow exactly what i needed for my family trip... works awsome... thx much!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Excellent! Love that I can also make changes online. Love that both Hubby and I can access the envelopes for our phones."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy. Just what I was looking for. Sync works well."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great Dev communication! Fixed the background service issue immediately. Love the app. Peeps: don't give it poor rating just cuz u don't understand it"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"For the first time in over 10 years my wife and I have been able to stick to a budget. 1) Super Easy and 2) you can manage it from any iPhone/Android or computer with internet connection."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly if you don't set up your envelope correctly in the beginning. Why won't it fund my envelope properly? Uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Really helps with organisation of my life, but would be nice to be able to delete some transactions"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great apps. But I need to record my daily income too. My income is not salary, so I just can`t set a budget before I know how much I`ll get."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Helping me budget. Super easy!!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Don't want details of my budget on your server thanks."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. I was budgeting this exact way but with paper. This is so much better and Hubby and I are always synced!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Ok."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Always loved the envelope system, just not rhe actual envelopes. This works!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love the app; works great!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Hard to set your income and small expenses like babysitting. Any recommendation for a good buget tracker???"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Please just fix message in latest version""stop spending for %d days"""
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Made 2 accounts and can't log in or retrieve passwords"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Best thing yet. A much easier way to keep up with my finances"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love it! Makes living on a budget easier because balances always available."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"fantastic!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Does not allow me to have more currencies which is no go for me."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"My fave free app. As useful as Mint, but simpler. (Also, Mint is only available to US or Canadian users). EEBA supports far more currencies."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Ok, but couldn't find option to change from pounds to dollars."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Should allow adhoc usage without having to register with developer's website."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. So glad I found it!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome life-changing app. The concept is very easy if you follow directions and have common sense."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It's interesting that they don't disclose their fees before trying to hook you into using their app. To be able to use this with keeping your check register costs $5 - $8 per month. Its' ridiculous!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app. Widget makes it very easy to enter money. Well done to the dev.."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great to be able to share a budget! Nice, clean, and simple interface, no problems on evo 4g."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"When I try to add funds it tells me I have two envelopes both with the same name to split money between?!?!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Too many bugs."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! Been using it for a few months now and love it."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Kinda pointless to use... you could always do this on your own without this app, why waste time plugging everything in to this? Uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awsome budget tool, for an on the go person or perfect for a husband !"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great piece of software. Needs a bit of time to get how it works, but then smooth sailing. Meaningful updates, widget, great web integration."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I hate apps that want to make me register."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"I don't get it, I'll stick to pen and paper n calculator :p"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Can't figure out how to adjust income. Have plenty of expenses but allocates money from what? Then syncs envelopes so allocation is inconsistent. Meh."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I'm a freelancer, I don't get periodical envelopes"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Helps so so much with my family budget! I love you for this! lol"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Can't change currency ??? Why not ?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"I love it....the syncing is great.....umm I'm guessing the only confusion is for those who do not have the app synced to their account"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I've used it daily for months and love that it syncs on my husbands phone. On our way to debt free!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"GREAT app. Much better than Mint."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Only one out there with sync feature. Nice and straight to the point."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Confusing. Just allot money without entering monthly salary. Yeah just put money here there without deducting from actual salary."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Great app! I don't understand how people are confused."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"I like the concept of this.. and how it can help to plan your budget. But why we cannot change the currency?!! Please include other currencies OK?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I think this is an excellent and easy to use app. I can't quite understand why people find it confusing, but maybe some are not familiar with the envelope budget concept. There's a good video on eeba's website which lays it out pretty clearly."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Id give it 0 stars. Do not put on phone-wants too much information and is confusing not user friendly.dont bother waste of time"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Really helped with my family's budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Confusing and counterintuitive. Crap. Uninstall."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Keeps force closing when I try to start my envelope starting point at over 1000.00. Uninstalled."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Confusing, it's budgeting before knowledge of salary amount input."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Confusing, and doesn't let me do stuff I need. Lame."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Just didn't do what I wanted. I want the total for the day even if I add something to come out later."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Complicated"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Really great app that helps me with budgeting. I can set a financial goal and remain within it with this app as I record where all my money goes."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",4,"Great app, I was looking for something like this and didn't even know it. Thank you. Don't mess this up."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Theres a limit on envelopes? I loved it untili found that out!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"Confusing! : ("
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Awww yeah 5 star app! Tried more expensive stuff only to use this free one, I'm a dumbass, don't write reviews, and feel strongly about this app!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"Too confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"I have used envelope budget systems in the past, and have recently had a major income change and this app is putting me back on the right track!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"This has really helped my wife and I stay away from the impulse buying. It is a great app"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"EEBA's helped me keep my budget for the last 12 months!"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Need to be able to enter tow different pay periods."

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"It's confusing."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"Very frustrating app. Can't even add a recurring expense in the free version"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",1,"I don't understand how to use this app."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"OMGolly! EEBA saved my budget! I recommend setting up the envelopes online first just bc it's easier but def. get this app ASAP! HTC Incr."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT! Just what I needed! :)"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use budgeting tool. Perfect"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Exactly what we needed to help our son learn how to budget his money, and now we use it too! Love that we can share between multiple phones and use the computer to access the account. The Quick Record makes it super easy to enter transactions on the spot. Unfortunately, my other son has an iphone, which doesn't have an app that even comes close to this. Is there any chance of making a version for the Iphone?"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",3,"No place to put your budget."
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Fantastic! Easy for us to budget and communicate about money and no need for specific envelopes! This is exactly what i was looking for!"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",2,"It works but is cconfusing to set up and editing budget amounts between weekly and monthly expences. Not too good for weekly and monthly budgets"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Sangat bagus! Excellent"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Maybe add a feature that shows how much was spent each month, I love the running total update"
"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Just started a 50-30-20 budget today. EEBA makes it painless to track expenses and balances for Survival NEEDS, Basic WANTS, and SAVINGS/Debt respectively! A++"

"Goodbudget: Budget & Finance","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull app, worth the money for the upgrade!"
