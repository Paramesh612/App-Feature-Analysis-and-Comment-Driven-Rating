"Paytm Money: Stocks, MF, IPO","Unknown",1,"Review updated after regular use of 3+ years: 1. Used to be a decent app when initially started investing thru it during 2021. There were still so many rooms for improvements. I suggested few of them. 2. Starting beginning of 2023 they migrated their user base to BSE STAR platform, and that marked beginning of their downfall. 3. Removed MF portfolio progress tracker, incoherent customer service response, no risk ratios to assess funds, SIP date gets updated automatically. Downgraded rating to 1*"

"Paytm Money: Stocks, MF, IPO","Unknown",3,"Recently the customer service has gone to worse. The ticket is not handled properly after describing the issue and some irrelevant comment is given and no action taken after days or weeks of time. Otherwise I feel this is a great platform for mutual fund investments. If the issues are not resolved, then I have to find another option for my investment. No concrete solution after raising support request in the app itself. Customer service is gone to worse level."

"Paytm Money: Stocks, MF, IPO","Unknown",4,"Dear Team Paytm Money This app is really amazing but I think there must be below mentioned 2 improvements. 1- Buy and sell orders must be click based not swipe based as swipe based orders takes time and click based help traders to buy and sell order instantly. 2- when we close app during a position and reopen the app then there is a lag of around 2 seconds for displaying the realtime price. Whereas in zerodha it's lagfree. Kindly workout on above 2 suggestions."

"Paytm Money: Stocks, MF, IPO","Unknown",1,"Paytm Money don't provide the option to talk to a real person, only chat option is available for help. Customers always want a representative to talk for their money related matters, It builds trust. Also, many options are unavailable to choose from in options menu which makes difficult to find where to go and what to choose. Customer support on Chat does not answer all questions at one go. It is not chat, it is more like emailing. Please improve and bring real representative. #sebiregulations"

Currently we have to click ""View all"" to get timeline option to compare funds in category. But in ""View all"" all funds except the concerned funds is visible. So its getting difficult to compare. Kindly revert back to previous framework for ""Funds in this Category"" with timeline visible without need to click ""View all"" Overall you have best informative design and features among peers like Coin, Groww."

No news screen. 5. No Sentiments or forum where stock related stuffs can be discussed."
