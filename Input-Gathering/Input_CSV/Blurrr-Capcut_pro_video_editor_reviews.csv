"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Its really good, the problem is, my screen always freezes and its laggy as heck,cand sometimes it deletes all my progress, but overall ig its better than capcut since its greedy now. Edit: Blurr has been getting kind of worse now, my screen freezes EVERYTIME even when i dont use that much effects. I cant even edit in peace atp, if this keeps going on i might rate it to 1. Please fix it, thank you."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Please fix this issue when I try to import video the app crushes if only this crash gets removed than it's 10/10 app for me!"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"I have good internet, but why does it keep saying that I have an abnormal internet connection? Pls fix this issue when I watch others edit it won't play it says network timeout but I have good and fast internet so there's no internet issue but your app issues and one more thing it won't let me log in why is that? I reinstalled it but nothing changed."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Just did my first test, it's absolutely useful if you want high quality edits. Sure, it might be long to make, but it's definitely worth it. And this is honestly better than procut (capcut), and it let's you use pro features without paying!? This will replace capcut for high quality edits like this. Thanks for making this app! March, 1, 2025"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"I would have given this app a 5 star but with the latest update I can no longer watch a ad yo use pro features. I used to think this app was better than capcut but now this just makes it worse. I'm moving back to capcut because of this. At least I can get free capcut apks"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"This app is perfect for me I'm a editor and use it I would have given it a 5 stars but I didn't because today I opened up blurr to use it in a edit and it didn't open or work idk what happened but I need the bug fixed"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"My hopes for this app is really big. It's not amongst those average video editing apps. The best thing is that you can just lower the resolution whenever you want to make it lag less. But i think there should be some more improvements too. Like adding more options to the text feature, adding a vector drawing feature, and most importantly making the presets feature better. You can only save text and effects and etc. for now, but it would be better if you could save everything like projects too."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"An amazing editing software, would have give all five stars but I think there's a new bug. Sometimes when I add a certain fx on a clip and then group my work, the effect disappears. And even when I enter the group to add it again it would respond. Please fix this and also add the copy and paste feature for speed graphs. Bring interpolation back!üò≠üôè Thanks."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Beta version should be improved"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Fine app. Lots of cool features, works for basically any kind of editor. My main gripe is the sheer amount of bugs and paywalls. Like, 90% of the features you need SVIP for, about half of those paywalled features being free on literally any other video editing service. The lag is awful, it's plain unusable if you ever decide to run multiple layers at once, crashes whenever you interact with anything and running at like 2 frames per second. Please listen to user feedback."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"omg the app is so great even though you have to have internet to download the effects it is so good this is a gamechanger. now I can finally make good videos"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"The app is good but I cant export one of my videos so far the other videos I made are able to be exported did I use too much effects till it lagged or is it a bug?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"Hello! I just have a few suggestions. Can you enable multi-selection of photos while editing. It takes time to import multiple photos. Why not make an option where we can import multiple photos or media at a time? Also, regarding time marks (the marks whose default color is orange) it is hard to move at these time marks manually, why not make an option where we can move from one mark to another with just one click, the feature similar to alight motion? Promise, it will make editing a bit easier."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"i haven't use this app(my first time btw) but i keep not finding the settings to enable auto snap plz help"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Could be a good app. However, there is a paywall for pretty simple effects. The templates don't work that well, seeing how they love to crash a lot. It could genuinely be a good app, though. Just there seem to be a few issues regarding crashing."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Love the app, but there is a problem w it trying to use emojis, but some won't show. I wish that could be fixed n the lagging also needs to be worked with if that could be fixed."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"this app was fun and easy to use. but my main problem is that over half of the stuff isn't free, you have to pay to use SIMPLE things and it's ridiculous! not everyone can spend their money on an editing app subscription, how greedy to try to put a pay wall on something so insignificant. i know you need money somehow, but how about making it actually functional to people who have actual necessities to buy. yes the price is low but that's still money people actually NEED for things!"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"The app is great, don't get me wrong,but problem is some features aren't available which makes me quite upset. Let's start of with text, the text editing is extremely limited on Android devices. Half of the features iOs has, Android doesn't. Text animation, simple transitions. We're limited to transformation feature and barely any text editing as in fonts or colors. Next is features missing in presets, everytime you import one you'd be hit with ""this effect is missing -"" and you have to redo it"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing like powering off my tablet and says some type of code, i cant even uninstall it DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"I tried editing in Blurrr but it keeps bugging and whenever I try to review it it keeps freezing idk if its because I'm using Android, but it's still good because u can export in Blurrr unlike capcut so yeah üëçüèª"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"Please give us a warning next time when using some features like the anime resolution quality. I've spent approximately 1 hour and 40+ minutes leaving my phone open and hoping it was rendering. After it finished rendering, I was greeted with a pay wall, a subscription to pay just to save it to my device, not too mention it was laggy too. I'm sorry but as a first time user of this app, I am extremely disappointed hoping it was going to be better."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"As much as I love the app, I didn't like how everything is not free. I get that the developers need money, but not everything has to be paid. Also It's a bit manageable for the controls of the app."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Great app but it keeps lagging every 5 minutes even there's no effects?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"I'm glad I switched to this application instead of capcut, because of the number of functions that have become pro and the indelible watermark, I lost my desire to edit but in this application, not only there are more functions available for free, but the editing itself is better for me, I highly recommend itü´∂ü´∂"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"This app was great in the past but there is a issue on whenever I get a video clip that I want to split I can't split it properly anymore , it lags my video clip and sometimes kicks me out of the app I enjoyed editing on this app before but now it is very frustrating please fix this issue only this issue I don't have any other issue with anything else"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Okay so im legit going to be fr blurrr is sm easier and less laggier than capcut, unlike capcut most of the filters and features are free and their for a reason way better than capcuts effects/filters, my only problem is that the exporting process took me a bit longer than expected to export my first blurrr edit but other than that i think this is way better than capcut, i love how the edits arent laggy. tysm for reading !! (U can watch the edit on @sweetdiariesx on tiktok<3)"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"The beauty of this app was that for the vip effects the free users have the option to watch an ad to use them, but what irritates me is that the option is there but it has never loaded an ad which is infuriating because why is it there when its not going to work please fix this"

On a galaxy A03S, the video is too laggy to even see the clips without any vfx, even on 1/8 preview resolution. Also, when i cut my clips, if I export it the cuts mess with the audio so i either have to extract the original audio or fix it on capcut. I also have to speed ramp my clips on capcut because I can't even see if my clips are flowing. The positives outweigh the negatives."

Also, would be better if we had an option to cut the clips inside the app, like previewing the clips and cutting the parts we want. Another problem is that I love to edit here, but can't work for too long due to the light-mode, which gives me a headache. Blurrr would be awesome with Dark-mode. Awaiting for the next update!"

Please add the presets option on IOS, we all would appreciate it if you'd prioritise it. It helps us editing, and grows the community. Another request, could you make us so stuff for juice? Like for example, we can mix up effects, call it something and submit to devs for ideas. If the idea works, we get juice. Like that. Where it's a win win for you and us. Thanks for bringing blur rr!"

But, as an anime editor, I'd like to enhance my edits quality after finishing it properly. So, it'd be nice if you actually add options for not only 4k, but also the other resolutions. Because, even if I enhance the clip quality, any editing software will compress it down to 720p for a better editing experience. So, please consider the fact."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"My Device Is Realme C35 and it has 4gb RAM and the processor is OctaCore and still don't know why but it keeps crushing while exporting the video. Even I can't export the video using ""Anime Super Resolution"" feature. It's horrible that Blurr can't export a single 10+ Seconds video. Blurr Community, I'm requesting u to solve the problem as soon as possible."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"Preview is lagging and freezing, the app isn't optimised for Android I guess."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"This app is just like alight motion but easier, literally one of the BEST. However, i encountered a horrible situation where i was just going to import a music which then said ""media entity"" which was also i couldn't understand because it was completely fine back few days ago when i imported a music. Please fix this."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"This is not like ios version we can't edit much on this Now I Think Alight motion is good man bring us same version like IOS."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I used to use this to edit but for some reason it speeds the edit up and there is no button or anything to put it back to normal speed so for the next update I really hope it fixes this"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"it's bad, it can't be used, don't ever download this application!!!!! If you want to edit you can't move the video, every time you want to edit the video it's stuck, it's really bad, I know the application has its pluses and minuses, but if it's like this, it's the same, you can't use it, just move it, it won't move, the video just wants to zoom, it won't move."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"There is a no cutout option for clips while this is the most important feature a video editing app should leave üòî"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"now this is much more easier to edit but it would been better if added 60 fps"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"It's so laggy and when is the new Android update coming because I have an android right now and how come the apps kicks me out of the app?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"sadly it's unusable as the video doesn't load in the preview even if you lower the quality. the app has a LOT of potential and I've been waiting for features to be incorporated as promised even before the beta got released. it's unfortunate that there's still so many bugs but hopefully it will get better with time. until then, I'll have to stick with capcut."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"This is good but its so hard am new btw"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Blurrr is kinda like capcut, its good but at the same time the effects are kinda basic and editing here is alright, for a free app its pretty good but I'd stick to after effects instead, for a phone editing app its good anyways i recommend it for people who dont have a pc or apple."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Good but we want quality enhancer like ios users"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Finally, you added some features that we need as Android users, but... the app has become worse in terms of lag... when I add a video... the screen becomes black... or the video doesn't move... I can't edit like this at all. please fix it."

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I don't like how the android version has less features üòï"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"i just downloaded this app and yes i can say that this is good it has everything that you need especially when doing edits like velocities, slowmo, so on and so forth. but, i noticed that when everytime i adjust something, there is that vibration thingy and for me it's kind of annoying and noisy. and since this app is still in beta cuz it got realeased months ago, i would suggest that you would remove it because i'm scared the app might suddenly lag because of it. thank you<3"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"I'm not gonna lie. I've wanted to use blurr for a while now. But when I downloaded the app. Theirs nothing. 99% of the features aren't even there."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"There are 2 things. Whenever I adjust the Intensity, Exposure etc of effects it vibrates so hard and rough!. It's very disturbing and annoying. I am really very disappointed with this. MOREOVER there is no setting of vibration or anything else! I really request the whole team, Please fix these problems ASAP!."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"i think u should add the option same like on iOS version, we're for the Android users was so sad because doesn't have speed option so we can't make velocity üò≠"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"IT doesnt have the quality that people say cuz its blurrr beta"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Kindly update this app. It's not good. And even some basic feature for text isn't available like text spacing. This really sucks. I hope it improves. Looking forward to it. And also the beat marker ain't good. You should be improving it."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"It's a good editing app it's just the ""media type exception""like no"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"THIS APP DOSE NOT HAVE SPEED AND VELOCITY"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"WHERE THE UPDATE BLURRR"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Good but please respect android users too! I download this app bcs it makes the quality better but that option is only avaible for ios users! It's not fair! respect us please"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"please do add all of the effects, modes, etc from ios to android. maybe like the fps thingy??? add it, if you don't even have it here it's still bs"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Muito simples de se utilizar e pr√°tico, possui os efeitos b√°sicos e vem com filtros prontos. No momento n√£o vi erros, s√≥ esperava que a fun√ß√£o ""cutout"" estivesse nas op√ß√µes de editar. Mas como ainda √© vers√£o beta, eu espero..."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app for anime üòÅ . But developers should give more features like in after effects,capcut and other platforms. Thanks"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"Its finally released, and im glad they published it the app is cool many effect and systems. But one thing is its not the same system i saw on tiktok"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"Too long to load, my video is 20+ minutes long, it's so long, on CapCut it didn't load too long but here? It will probably take an hours to load. So this app is a no for me unless the developer fix this problem, also the Anime Super Resolution, when exporting, it'll take a lot too, also alot of bugs in the app."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Mate my clips are freezing and u have to wait so long for a scenepack to load"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"App is good üî• but we need the twixtor feature as soon as possible, can't waitüóøüî•"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Good editing app not as alight motion though üåö"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"It is a good application for editing, I use Android and all the time my clips are just freeze, i don't know if this same happens in iOS but please, do something about it or my device is not capable for this application? #helpblurrr"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"U added Time Remap Nice"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Loved using this"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"It's good but when will the full version of this app is gonna release?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"iOS version of blurrr is much better than Android version of it becoz of its features in iOS version isn't in Android"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Best app to edit"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"pretty good start"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"It would've been a great editing app however it starts to lag as soon I put a video on, I cannot input the location of the beats properly to ensure the different sections are not off beat."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"This app awesome! But theres a problem, there is no speed. Now i cant make some velocity :("
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Hi blurrr app, thanks for allowing android phone to have this app in our playstore"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"So slow to bring updates and lie yo you"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"W editing app but can't wait for presets to get added"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"Its too laggy"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"The app throws me out every time i open it"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Please update android"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"It's good but,where does my velocity go??"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I could see my editing progress on the preview but then it became black and my preview didn't work for my edit üòûüòû and when I make a new edit the preview thing works but for my previous edit it doesn't! all my efforts been wasted üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"I have a question ... Why isn't there any cutout option for me ? It's really hard for me"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, it gives you control over everything, genuinely the best editing app out here. How ever i do hope you soon add an multi-selection option for the Effects and a copy button in addition to duplicate button. Because when you group certain elements you can't copy any of them outside of the group or into another group. You often have to un-group, duplicate the element, move it and then regroup all the element thus going through rendering again. Sorry for the long reviewüòÖ Have a nice day!"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Why is it so different in ios and Android? Kinda suck because im using an oppo(android) then i borrowed my moms iphone and i see it completely different, whats up with that? I waited months for this to come out in android but its disappointed because its not good, I don't know if its because its BETA or what"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"The app is bad"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Its not that bad but the app is beta version i cant really do a lot like reverse or velocity edit"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"3 stars for now. While I'm familiar with the ios version, Android version doesn't look too good. There's no dark mode and editing for long period of time gives severe headaches. Half of the features are still in development so can't say much tbh. And please add preview like node video where it takes around a minute to load the clip the you get real time playback with 0 lag no matter how much effects we put in."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"I love the app but beta blur has no features üòï"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I am very disappointed with this app because it is still in beta version, I want its official version with 60 fps, because it is feel very laggy, so please release its official version as soon as possible."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I love this app but some time it doesn't show clips or edit bar and it's hard to back it normal i also play big ram games but doesn't lag i request to creators to fix this"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"This app is great but it needs more advancements.. I've seen many cool edits people made but sadly, I cannot replicate them even with tutorials as this android version lacks the needed systems like adjusting speed and shared presets. However, I'm glad this app finally made it to the android version! I would love to make very cool edits with this app as it looks easier than any other editing app. But without speed, I can't make basic twixtor edits so please add it as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"It's very good üíó"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"Love it,but i rather have the original version and full, can't really do alot of type of edits with beta version,anyways when will the full version come?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Great editing app, but without any more of the options like speed and etc on android, its pretty useless, but still a great app on apple tho!"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app ü•∞üòçü•∞ü•∞üòòüòò"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I'm an editor as well, but there are still missing parts for example, speed, fps changer. Will it be added on android?"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"It's slow when I'm loading it and I bearly know how to use that app like put in a tutorial pls we need it for starters like me"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"Overall It's an great app, for me it is easy to use and the quality is good enough I am very satisfied. But the only thing is I need to do velocity, and more.. But I'll look forward to it more!"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Hello blur app, I am glad that the android version of blurr comes up! I feel so exite when it notifies. I derictly downloaded it. I don't know but I can't add an image or video, whenever I click the ""video/photo"" it will go to file and there is gallery, even I clicked a video it just like automatically back, and the video or image I clicked isn't in. I tried to look its permission granted 'cause what if the ""file"" permission is disabled. But it is not there. Maybe I don't know how it works.."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"This is beautiful editing but, please Don't take too long to download resources, when the video is long, it takes too long to edit, so bothering"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",3,"I like the app but the problem is there's no speed Button"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"As a capcut editor ive been waiting for blurrr for so damn long. ive noticed capcut lags all the damn time. this app will really really help me alot. i cant wait to see more"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"This app is frustrating.. first of all The export or rendering... when i finished my edit and when i render it.. the video is glitching and laggy..

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",1,"please bring more features to this app."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Bro I waited for this app since April but in the end they didn't gave the ""tool option"" in which they have the anime high resolution. I wanted this app for good quality videos but what's the point when you don't have it for Android users that's so unfair I'm better with my CAPCUT üò≠"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"So I got the app and so far it was mostly good. It's gonna take me a while to get used to it since I mainly use Capcut. The only downsides are that the highest export resolution is 1080p and no 60fps. And there is no smooth slow motion but I guess it will come when the full version is out."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"I don't have the time remapping thing or fps changerüò≠"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"NEED 1440P SUPPORT"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"it's finally on android! i hope they'll put more cool effects and templates in the future updates though"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",2,"Maybe i just dont know enough about the app but it doesnt seem to have even half of the features it does on IOS. I am aware its in beta but still there is really nothing you can do with this app at the moment. Just use capcut."
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"I'll really be waiting for this app for too long and now it's here.... I'm really happy but please don't do the effect paid please let the all effects free ( sorry for Bad English)"

"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",4,"App is good . Features are also good. But when we apply motion tiles and motion blur in 1 clip its preview starts to lag . So on prerendering that clips directly also does not work . First you have to make group of that clip with other clip and then after prerendring new group its gets smoother playback. Also there is no feature to fast / slow video . Add it as soon as possible . Hope next updates will be more finished and feature loaded. Thanks"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Do I even have to say something"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"BEST EDITING APP EVER!"

Anyways please fix these little bugs because i really love this app üôè"
"Blurrr-Capcut pro video editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Please add more glitch effects, I can suggest some: Cross glitch, glitchify, VHS/glitch line, Glitch A2, Glitch D4/VHHS, TV lines, and Anamorphic flare. Add motion blur with pre-masking blur. Add these types of graphs: Elastic graphs, Step graphs, Bounce graphs, Noise graphs, and Cyclic graphs. Add more coloring/filters add ""glow"" in adjustments so we can make our colorings better. I am suggesting these now because the creator would notice it more early. Thanks. Waiting for it. üíï"
