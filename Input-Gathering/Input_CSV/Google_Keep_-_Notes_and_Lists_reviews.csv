"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"2025 Update: This app has greatly improved, and I should have update my review long before now. It has supplanted other such apps for me. Upgraded from 2 to 5 stars. -- 2017: I started using this app heavily not too long ago after some casual usage at first. Found it has problems syncing, making it essentially useless for ongoing use across devices. It's ok if you plan to only use it on one device consistently."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"I was a traditional paper pen person. However, when I found out the notes can follow you through all your devices, I was sold! It's so easy to use. I figured out how to group notes by label. You can add practically anything to it. I'm not sure if there's a way to keep certain notes private."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Thanks so mush"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"Wish the android version could support notes zoom-in, and bold fonts."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"It's terrible You can't edit the text (no underline bold, italicize) It's functions are too rigid and the arrangement of notes requires you to scroll all the way."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"How is this still missing basic text formatting, grouping and note locking"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Love Google products, Keep Notes also. But this needs to have a pass/pin/biometrics protection option, a few more formatting options (highlight / font color/size/types) and option to search inside a note. When those option would be added, I would be more than happy to change my rating to a 5 star. Edit: Rating made an impact. Improved 1 star as per B/I/U being added. If note encryption, font colour/size/type and Search would be added, it would be 5 stars from me for sure"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"When are you guys going to give updates related to security ? Still there is no option to lock the notes with any form of security. It will be more welcoming if it allows the user to lock some notes with mobile security or something."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Great App, But Needs In-Note Search Google Keep is a fantastic notes app, but it lacks a crucial feature: searching for specific words within a single note. Right now, search works across all notes, but finding text inside a long note requires tedious scrolling. It would be great if Keep could highlight searched words and automatically scroll to them within an open note. This would make reviewing long notes much faster and more efficient. Hope to see this feature in a future update!"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"A good app if you're looking for where to store important notes such as passwords and other text, all synced to your Google account. Even if you lose your phone, you can access your files once you install this app on your new device. My major problem with this app is that the developers have failed to include a password lock option. This has made me sort for alternative apps."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"This app deserves one star just because it doesn't have private notes.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Great simple app, but no passcode option to truly protect your notes if somebody has access to your phone.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Good Apps"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"I will uninstall the app right after leaving this review. Google Keep abases itself with cheap tactics of displaying an overlay pop-up at its mobile view, with the ""no thanks"" button hidden out of the mobile page maliciously set to zoomed-out, to trick users into installing its app after clicking everywhere without a response at its mobile view. Guys, use 2 fingers to zoom out the mobile page, say ""no thanks"", then migrate your notes elsewhere and leave this disgusting Google Keep."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Hi Google LLC! This app is great to use at home and office. All the features are great. But I would like to make a suggestion that when we make a note, we can add a background to the note and there are only a few backgrounds. Can you perhaps add more backgrounds? I would like the app to have more backgrounds as well as could there be option to undo and redo options, and changing some fonts. It would be wonderful to see these changes in the app. Can't wait to see it. Thanks!"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"It's great! I like how easy it is to access information on multiple devices. Where I think it can improve is updating it to have *increased word storage*.

Example: from a list of 10 items, if I remove 6th one, the 7th to 10th should automatically become 6th to 9th. But it doesn't. 2. The arranging of notes in specific arrangment doesn't stay.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Google Keep is really a pretty darn good note taking & task reminder app. Of the available note taking apps anyway. Microsoft OneNote is my my absolute favorite, but even it lacks some basic functionality that Google Keep has. I will say it desperately needs a ""search / find within note"" feature. You can search for a word in the app, and this filters the notes to display only notesthat contain that word. But when you open a note you have to find where within the note that word is yourself."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"In general, I'm satisfied with the app, just one thing that's very bothersome is that when you have Labels to organize Notes, you can not actually organize the Labes thenselves; Meaning the Order in which the Labels are shown on the left hand side. It's super inconvenient as the Labels exist to have a better overview but you can't manually sort the Labels about similar Topics to be standing right next to each other. Please change this."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Google Keep is a convenient tool for quick checklists!

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"Compared to other note apps this is severely lacking, it gets by by it's integration with Google and nothing more. Avoid Google and avoid this."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"I love the app but I find it unbelievable that you leave it possible for us to erase parts of the note without the possibility of regain it back! There is no save once you've written a note and if you erase or add something by error it remains like this coz there's no redo and also you can't just exit and enter again(without saving after the error!) and you've got back the whole note, included what you have erased by mistake. 1 star for every messed up note, 5 stars for a solution, guys, please!"

I prefer not to insert my pictures as they are huge in comparison to the note, visually taking up too much space when I'm doing a quick visual scan for something... I updated the app today, but sadly there are no visual improvements."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"Used to be one click to start a note, now it's multiple...there are many other apps for different things. Having a super simple app for notes/lists was great. You're actively ruining it, likely to the point where it'll become just another failed Google offering. 5 stars for the old version, 2 for the new. Still works, but too feature rich for what it was always meant to be. Will probably end up switching to an app where it retains the beautiful simplicity which this one has lost along its way."

It is easy to use and doesn't feel overwhelming but the problem im describing is pretty annoying. You lost the whole idea or reason to write anything because it is slow and take alot of time to write something correctly."

There's a general search bar that will pull up the notes that contain your searched key word, but unless it's in the preview of the note, it won't highlight where the searched word is in the note, even if you tap on it. It's really frustrating for longer notes and a super basic feature that seems obvious for a note-keeping app to have."

You can create text notes, picture, audio, drawings, and check-box lists. You can set reminders to notes. You can organize notes by pinning the most important ones at the top or creating labels for categories and color-coding them. You can also add fun and unique background designs to your notes to help customize them even more. I make notes for everything and I love this app."

Labels exist, similar to Apple Notes' tags, but there should be named folders other than these labels.

It always keeps the most recent note or list at the top, whereas I may want a different one to be at the top for ease of access. Edited 12.19.2021: at some point the app fixed so I can decide which notes stay at the top and which notes I can archive or delete, I'm changing this back to 5 stars."

You must click on reload or snooze or the message stays there. If you click snooze, it just keeps coming back. I clicked reload and it reloaded but a day or two later, it did the same thing again.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"As a frequent user of Google Keep, I find it to be a valuable tool for staying organized.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Although it's not perfect, I use google keep the most because of the incredible search feature and it's simplicity. The extra step needed to start taking a note is dumb, especially since you can already do all of those things from the Text version. It's pointless. My biggest wish is that the character limit for individual notes be removed. I almost never exceed the limit, but when I do, it is a real pain! Keep it simple, but limitless."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"I've used Keep for years. I was recently informed, through the app, that I needed to ""reload"" it. The notice stated that all the notes would be saved before the reload. I performed the reload and now all of my images/photos are gone."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Update - still cannot search within one note. Even though several updates have done. I really don't care for a note to have AI create it for me. I just need to search one note at a time. This can't be too hard to program and I see many other users asking. I love this app and use it daily. My only complaint is that you can search all notes but not within a note. Once it finds the note with the search word, it just pulls up the note and doesn't take you to the search word. I have very long notes."

There is a limit to the number of lists you can have, but it's somewhere in the 20s, I think. My biggest beef: IT NEEDS THE ABILITY TO CHECK ALL ITEMS. You can uncheck all, but you can't check all. I use it as a grocery list, and I need to double-check my order against my list. Then I have to go through and check every single item I ordered. Whose mistake was that???"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"The app has improved over the years and has turned out to be a useful tool.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"While I don't love the App, it is useful in most Situations! It's easy to use and it allows you to have Multiple Notes at Once! Down sides include not being able to Open Notes on other Devices (it's unclear if you actually can) and that The Organization of Notes Could be Better, like if one note is more Important than the One you Just Did, you have to Dig Around for that File and that Gets Annoying after a Few Months of off & on Notetaking!"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Google Keep Notes is a work of art. The app comes with intuitive features such using a ‚Ä¢, a - or a + to create unordered lists. Also just start with 1. and the list autoincrements. Images align beautifully at the top. No one does it better than Google. I highly recommend it. The new Floating action menu needs some work. It looks ridiculously obnoxious and unintuitive. Untypical of the smooth interface we've come to expect of Google."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"I'm a bit irritated by the fact that you now have to click twice to make a new note. I use this app for all my notes but I don't trust Google to make the right decisions so I may eventually move them over to somewhere else. Maybe instead of implementing invasive ai prompt buttons and useless menus, add stuff people would actually find useful like dates/word counts/folder systems."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"good app to organize my thoughts, daily activity. Make life problems easier...

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: In the latest update to Google Keep, Google decided that rather than opening a new note when we tap the plus (+) button, it now pops up with options that before were on the main UI (which means now I have to press two buttons instead of one in order to make a new note.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Great app but the vast majority of the time, I'm using it to quickly take a text note/save some text. The extra tap now required to choose the type of note makes it much less of a quick note app. I'd rather default to text, then change the note type for those few occasions I want to do something else. Perhaps a settings option to choose the default action so everyone can quickly use it for whatever their preferred purpose is and manually change for other purposes?"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"I've been using Keep for years and it was always perfect.

That means I now need to tap two buttons to start a note when it was just one tap before. That lowers productivity and is absolutely worthless, so please kindly revert it back as soon as possible."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"It's a good app but I have two things that tick me off about drawing in notes, first thing is that with the pen the thing gets bigger when you speed up but it should be the opposite, in a pen when you speed it can't keep up with the speed and less ink is deposited, but when slower the ink has time to absorb into the paper and therefore the radius is bigger. The other thing is that you should add stabilization, heck even the editing tool pf the Samsung camera has that, and it's a gimmick!"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"‚ÄúIn Google Keep, the original creation date of a note automatically changes to the latest edit date whenever a note is modified. For users like me, it would be helpful to have the original creation date preserved even after making edits, as it helps in tracking when the note was initially saved. I suggest adding a feature that keeps the creation date locked and only updates the 'Last Edited' date separately.

The ability to protect them with a password would allow me to: Keep my information private and secure: Prevent unauthorized access to my notes, even if my device is unlocked.

In Google's own browser for desktop and mobile you can search. But not in the app. I do like this app a lot and use it, not just daily, but hourly. I'm withholding a five-star rating until this is fixed."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"A few days ago, I started working with this application, but I think it has some shortcomings, such as the -possibility not to draw with fingers-, as well as the division of notes to be done by page, e.g. page 1, then page 2 and so on !"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"It used to be perfect, but now it's so slow that I have to wait a full minute for it to catch up with one sentence, not to mention that if that sentence happens to be long, it will eventually just jumble up the letters into an illegible mess. On top of that, I can't scroll anymore; when I open a long note, the app will not let me scroll to see the rest of the text, and if I try, it moves me back to the frozen spot.

I have GBoard installed, no mods, and this lag happens only on Keep. I even posted on the google docs forum, but the Gsuite product expert just gives dumb replies by suggesting to restart/reinstall when I clearly mentioned in the post that I have tried all that."

A few years back the app had once automatically deleted several of my notes without any reason, which is why I avoided using it.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Keep has improved a lot over the years. Nevertheless, it still have a few glitches and annoyances though (which mean room for improvements), like the fact that newly created checkboxes going at the very bottom of the notes sometimes, or the checkboxes' ""hands"" occasionally disappearing.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"This note-taking app lacks features, making it good only for basic tasks like grocery lists. For more complex needs like study-related notes or gym logs, it falls short. Here are some areas for improvement: 1. The bullet system needs enhancement. 2. It lacks an option to add dividers. 3. There's no option to create folders or groups for different categories of notes. While there are more issues, these are the most pressing ones. Hopefully, the developers will consider these suggestions."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"i've used keep for several years, but as my usage of it has led to dozens of notes, many of which containing long paragraphs of contents, the app has slowed significantly. i even started note-taking on a separate google account to no luck. i don't know if it's just my phone, but i type sentences at a time and they take forever to laggily load in. the app has recently been closing any time i open a note, even after an update. i'm kind of upset because i have so much of my work on here."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"The app started getting slow, then started crashing when trying to open any note. Then I realized that the application was not syncing the notes for two months already. I did't get any notification about it. In the settings of Android, the Sync option was useless. I tried to save the notes in docs, share them to access the content of my notes. It was all useless. I backed up the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the application, hoping to see my notes back again. All work of two months was lost."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Best NOTE app ever... Thanks for the Search, Bold, underline & other features. I'm glad the team took note of my feedback. Finally, The only remaining feature this AMAZING Note app needs is (1) an in-house Text-to-speech T2S feature, (2) an automatic move to the top-of-the-stack feature for already pinned notes & (3) a feature that can convert both the pictures & texts stored in each imstance into a PDF document without having to go the Google doc route.

It's very annoying! I don't understand why google thinks grouping expressions like ""01-01-24"" or ""95.86 - 14"" as a phone number is a very good idea?

Now days tho, it badly needs 2 updated options to be a 5 ‚≠ê app. 1) Password protection for notes. 2) Search function that highlights a searched term within a note (like ""find on page"" in Chrome or Explorer). Currently, search shows which note(s) a term is in, but not where = very inconvenient for medium to long notes. Come on Google Devs, you're awesome, so bet you could update these options no prob, & make Keep a 5 ‚≠ê app again!"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"To users: Get it. It's the best I've found so far. To creators: It's good but I'd really appreciate a lock on it. Yes, my phone locks but there will be times when someone is on my phone and I don't want them going through stuff. Also it'd be helpful to change the note backgrounds to custom images.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"(2024 update) Bare bones and minimal. It has come a long way since my initial review in 2013, but seriously lacks as a go to note app. It's ok for a phone because it's quick and easy, and I still use it sometimes because of that, but Samsung and Apple are far superior even considering Google's integration with it's own products. And if your at looking for a real note taking app, this isn't it. This is just 1 step above a paper sticky note."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Like all chromebook apps, this is just a mobile app, slapped into chromebooks without changing or utilizing any inputs for mouse and keyboard, which only makes doing things less effecient & more convoluted. Unlike the rest, the problem is only minor, with only the hold press in mobile not turned into a right click in chromebooks. Otherwise, this is a great app to make notes both online & offline instead of adding more clunk in Google Docs or notepad apps."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"Google Keep is a handy note-taking app that lets you create checklists, add images, and even record voice memos.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"The app took over 1 minute to load notes, especially when you switch between accounts. It's not realistic or practical in the digital age. The Web version loads much faster. However, changing accounts on the web forces shift into using the app, which is counter productive when the app's performance is low.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"it's very convenient to use, i like it a lot. HOWEVER, there are a few suggestions that would make it more convenient: 1. more customization for letters, such as colors. 2. the ability to attach and manually arrange multiple pictures in the actual notes page - even put them below checkboxes - not just at the very top. 3. the feature to word search between and within notes. hope these get implemented. app has great potential."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"comment for your suggestion: It seems you don‚Äôt know that reminders from Google Keep no longer sync with the calendar. This information is available on the internet, and Google has announced it. They have replaced ‚Äòreminder‚Äô with ‚Äòtask.‚Äô I find this change unnecessary. For instance, I had a reminder to take a pill, and now you‚Äôre forcing me to treat it as a task. It‚Äôs excessive to categorize it as a task. I clearly differentiate between a task and a reminder. To me, they are distinct things."

This and speech recognition both work fine but will not update unless connected to Wi-Fi as of last update. Please fix. Reply: I know how to troubleshoot and would not have left my original review if I hadn't already tried to fix it on my own.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"I think this is a very simple app to use, lovely to the eye. It is still short in functionalities and let's say customization; if I want to have a paragraph and then a list with checkboxes it will give my paragraph a checkbox too. Also I find it very disappointing that it doesn't keep the original date a note was created and instead updates to the last time the note was edited. It should be optional for what it's worth."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Very basic, serves the purpose for quick note taking. Strangely, it won't let you create plain text and checkboxes in the same note, or I'm overlooking something obvious. Here is a simple use case: You are making a grocery list for multiple stores in a single trip. StoreA (text) Item1 Item2 Item3 (Checkboxes) StoreB (text) Item1 Item2 Item3 (Checkboxes) I couldn't figure out how to format this. Of course one can create multiple notes.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"This app has been pretty great over the years, especially for making collaborative lists with my spouse such as for groceries. But one of the really irritating recent ""features"" is that when the cursor is on a line of a checkbox item and you check the box on that line, it then takes the focus all the way down to the end of the bottom of the list checked items where the checked item just went, instead of keeping you up at the list where you more than likely want to be."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"It is a very good app for note taking and also have to do list and remainders. It also have some minus points but that's alright! I would highly recommend this app."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Great app! But I wish there'd be info about when the note was created (date and time). Because sometimes I can accidentally type something into a finished note, and after that I can only see the ""last edited"" day. I then can no longer know how old is exactly a note is."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Dfgu"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Google Keep does a decent job of making simple notes but for any of my longer lists it gets cumbersome. I like categorizing things with color within a note, especially for checklists but Keep does not give you the option to change the text color. I like that the background can change, it's a cute feature but I need a way to highlight over and change the color of text to help me organize things. I would also like to see more text tools like strike through and more symbols."

And please make it universal so that we can see the same backed up data like the data on our phone showing on other devices instantly like on desktop."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"So the app is a solid option for notes. The issues or additions that would be great are : 1. The ability to lock your notes rather than just archive them. 2. Be able to divide your notes into different folders (to help organize your notes). 3. You have a search function already . However it would be helpful if when you search something and it shows the result you're looking for, that when you click on the desired note it scrolls down automatically to the results you were searching."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Overall, this is a decent note-taking/keeping app. However, two things take away from the workability of this app: Firstly: even though it is possible to insert images into notes, they cannot be inserted into the body text of a note, and instead remain separate. Secondly: unlike other note taking apps on the Play Store and other platforms, it is not possible to convert a note to a PDF file, or even save it in the internal storage of a device."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"One of the most beautiful and secure app full of amazing features. However, this app notes many important information but suffers from insecurity due to lack of lock system.

I am still using the Apple ecosystem and in their Notes apps the last date of editing is used. That can be clumsy because you sometimes do not want to change the notes order, but it is for me also a proof of correct sync between devices. I also miss some formatting options and password protection. If this has been taken are off I can stop using Apple's Notes and One Note."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"This app is great to take notes. Not too sophisticated and perfect for just taking notes. However I find it annoying that drawings and images just sit at the top of the page. It would be nice if it were incorporated it with the text. Also, the recording quality is very poor, plus it tries to capture each and every word we say, instead of focusing on the sound, which I find quite odd. One more suggestion: I would like to import an image and be able to use it as a background to my notes."

Looking elsewhere. 2/25/24 UPDATE: followed instructions to clear cache and the note that had disappeared suddenly reappeared which is a relief.

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"Decent app but lack of undo after backing out of a note - different from common file behavior where user is prompted to save changes - is so insensitive to data protection that I would be wary in using it to note anything of import. A crippling limitation."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Not bad. What I am missing the most is having option to organise the notes. Having Labels is not enough.

I don't sync anything if I can help it, because I don't need to, and I don't want to be bothered deleting info. I will share my notes when I need to, and i like that I can add photos to my notes."

The only thing that's keeping me hanging on and not switching completely, is the fact you can't lock an individual note with a password. That is the only thing missing from this app. It is simple to use, it has a nice look to it and I like the fact you can pin notes and choose the order of the notes."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"It will be just the greatest note taking app. In the market if google listen to users and add the option of changing the font size and types ,hope they will add that any time soon"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"I think it's good, but what would make it perfect is if there was an option that asks if you want to save the changes you've made. You can easily make a mistake in one of your notes without realising, and it'll get saved."

It's that whenever I write a long note, (numbered or unnumbered) looking for words or certain words are so hard especially if the document is really long.

So searching for docs are easier, because it's really difficult to keep scrolling all the way down to look for certain words if they can just be highlighted. THANK YOU !!"

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"Once upon a time this app was useful to quickly write down stuff on the go or do a quick copy-paste of a recipe, article or suchlike. Then text formating ""options"" became a thing. Since then, the ""quickly"" is gone. You have to be extremely careful not to trigger built-in autoformatting-bugs. e.g. any sequence of numbers longer than 4 signs is tagged as phone number (not undoable). Calling 2400g of flour starts to feel like a stupid joke to me. Writing math can be ""funny"" too that way."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"One of the major problems I have with Google Keep Notes is the fact that the app uses a default font where upper-case Is and lower-case Ls are near-identical -- and it makes proof-reading a nightmare! Despite several updates I made to the app, the only new thing you can do is make text bold, italic or underlined. You still cannot use different fonts (in my case, Tahoma and Times New Roman.)

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"The widgets are just too big and you cant type into the widgets, you have to open the note through the widget to modify anything. Notes will somehow just archive themselves and they become out of sight out of mind. The only thing it has going is that you can create sub categories for notes, but most note apps have this feature. Just avoid this in general, especially if you're looking for something to help with productivity."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",2,"It's a good notes app. My main problem with Google Keep is that since adding note formatting, the feature keeps 'breaking' - you can only format in mobile, so if you add some italics to a note and open it on desktop, you lose the formatting. Returning to the app won't allow you to reformat; the formatting button becomes unusable on mobile once you open a formatted note on desktop. This is a huge disappointment, especially since you don't have to open the note on desktop for this to happen."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"I actually love this app, specially use this for almost all type of daily usage. There not a single reason not to give a 5 star. But i have some suggestions too like if this have different font options like in docs (eg: atleast bold, italics, mono, strike though etc) or option for highlighting texts it will be much attractive. Also, in grade arrangement of saving notes sometimes it seems difficult to identify which note is saved earlier, it'll be better if somehow it can be improved."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",4,"Simple and good app. Has text and list notes which are synchronized to Gool Drive. For me, sorting list is highly desirable."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"The text size doesn't fit anymore. Whenever I copy a text to Samsung Mail it is now 18 instead of 12. Wasn't like this before. It also would be nice to highlight search entries in the note itself and not just display the note."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"okay, at first i had mixed feelings about this app. i wanted to italicize and bold some things, consider i enjoy doing that a lot. when i tell you i got so happy when they added the feature to where you can italicize, bold, and all that other stuff. this app is the best choice if you want to take simple notes. i have been using this app for a while and when i tell you this is THE notes app. well, for everyone who has an android i hope you can agree üò≠. im very picky when picking apps so TRUST."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",3,"Things I'd like to see: opacity option for the widget. Cleaner, lighter, and brighter bg colours in app & widget for dark mode. The current colouring is ugly af. Other than that, I love the app and it's taken over my other quick notes/list app. EDIT: Not sure why the reply sends me to a community help forum. What I suggested were widget opacity & more bg colours. The former isn't an option in app and the later has a limited amount of ugly muted colours/bgs. It's not a query. It's fact."

"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",1,"It lets you add items to lists, but you can't categorize the items. I use Our Groceries app for grocery lists and categorize items by the isle they're in at the store to make my shopping experience easy. I used to be able to use Google Assistant to add items to Our Groceries, but Google doesn't support that anymore. Google Keep isn't very easy to use, you have to remember where things are in the store and manually rearrange them to make your shopping experience easy with this app."
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Keep - Notes and Lists","Unknown",5,"I find the app to be quite impressive; however, I've encountered an issue while searching.

I suggest incorporating this feature in future updates to make the Google Notes app even more user-friendly."
