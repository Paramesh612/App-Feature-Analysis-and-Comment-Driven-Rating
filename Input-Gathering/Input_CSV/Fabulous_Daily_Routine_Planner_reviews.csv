"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash, money grabbing scheme"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay on track with building good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware! I deleted this app and the subscription from my phone but they still found a way to charge me for an additional year without a reminder and refused to offer a refund after I requested. Submitted the refund request a day after the annual charge. Unless you are careful, you will pay for this app forever - regardless if it is on your phone, if you cancelled your Google subscription. If they can get to your money they will. I already wasn't using it because I didn't find it useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful. Hard to cancel the membership. Money grab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App is very good and useful and easy to use but the problem is it does not work when network is weak and can't use the app. When the network is low"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted a planner, not a subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing, it has been helping me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good luck trying to cancel. They will keep trying to charge your card EVERY YEAR."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like it. It has a lot of coaching and you have to spend certain time listen to stuff ehat makes the environment boring. Also it difficult to personalize the day and it's difficult to add specific activities. I need to browse an infinite amount of possibilities. I feel like it was a waste of money and sadly I can't get a refund. I would've been nice to have a month to ask for a refund or something."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fabulous with a few glitches: 1. when the notification comes in, tapping on it no longer brings us to the relevant section in the app 2. Real life streaks do not start again and again from zero. If you've been doing something regularly a long time, one absence or 2, should not count as starting again - it is just part of the habit, sometimes life gets in the way and then u just continue. 3. I cannot reschedule my gratitude practice time. I am asleep at 11pm when it notifies me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HEADS UP ‚ö†Ô∏è... THERE IS A $10 + .30 FEE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR A SET UP FEE, EVEN WITH THE 14 DAY TRIAL PERIOD. THIS IS NON REFUNDABLE. ‚ö†Ô∏è AFTER 14 DAYS, YOU WILL BE INSTANTLY CHARGED THE SUBSCRIPTION AND A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CLARIFY APP AS WELL. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT FINANCIAL INFORMATION YOU GIVE THESE APPLICATIONS, YOU WILL NOT GET A REFUND. TRUST ME, I HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS. I HAD TO LEARN THE HARD WAY."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has changed my life! I have never had the drive, motivation, or faith that i get with Fabulous! I have gone to many therapists and programs and I did make a lot of progress that way but after about 6 years I felt stuck in my i had no clear direction. I kept hearing ""you have to do the work"" but no one could tell me what work i was supposed to do. Fabulous gives you a clear path to follow and i trust if i follow it i will reach my goals! Thank you Fabulous for giving me hope!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS A SCAM. If I could give 0 stars, I would. They make it impossible to cancel your subscription or get a refund. I've contacted customer support 3 times and haven't heard back. They say to contact their customer support email then fill out a form and you end up going in a circle. This app has stolen $200 from me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Suspiciously charged me $40, for a subscription I never agreed on. Asked for it to be returned, they returned less. Trash app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the reflections and phrases he uses from philosophers and characters. It really motivates and the dynamics it uses are phenomenal. I recommend it super. ü´∂"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too much asking for money. I just bought a plan and before I have even taken a peak into the app I am being asked to buy another subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really great app! Follow simple steps every day! Too many ads in the program - even after I paid for it I still see ads for their other apps - not cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a great app!!! But why does great thing have to be paid? I liked the feature that gave 1 day free of everything no matter what. It should be like that at least for users who have committedly proven they deserve the app by following and completing routines for the day?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish I could rate it 0 stars. This app doesnt help its impossible to stay consistent with and its frustrating to even open. Not worth the money DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I canceled and deleted the app like a month into my year subscription and of course I get a notification for a $39.99 charge a year later. I contacted for a refund and of course giving one is some how against their policy even if you dont use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried this out, it wasn't for me so I cancelled. This app KEEPS CHARGING MY CREDIT CARD $39.99 every few days This app is for you if you enjoy spending lots of time on the phone with your bank. Update: Fabulous stopped charging me for 3 months and then today, out of the blue, charged my credit card again. This app is a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a beautiful and thought-through app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"[Edit: They somehow got another one of my email addressed and are spamming IT with ""hay your card didn't work"". How did they do that???] I have email evidence that I canceled my free trial. Tell me why my bank shut off my card because y'all tried to charge me?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app is lovely! I appreciate the art style and the variety of options it has to build routines, all of them healthy. The collections of wisdom are in alignment with goodness and when paired with the art, it makes me feel good about caring for myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Most Notifications do not open app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I cancel my subscription, there is nothing on Google. But it still deducted 1 year fee. And I gave a 1 start rating.. but when I contacted their support.. i was refunded within 5 min (still hasn't received amount as it say google takes 5-10 days gor refund). But this was very nice.. so I gave then 5 start now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This program is absolutely fabulous! The goals are not only measurable but also incredibly easy to incorporate into my routine‚Äîso much so that I sometimes forget to click ""completed!"" More importantly, it has given me the time and space to care for myself in ways I previously overlooked while focusing on others. The mindfulness practices I've learned have truly enhanced my world, bringing a new level of awareness and balance to my daily life. Lastly, I love the upgrades ‚Äî adds even more value"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful, dishonest app. I made sure I did not sign up for the premium account, yet they charged me. The app is difficult to use and counter-intuitive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't like that I have to download so many apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM!! I signed for a month's trial, and I got charged twice within 14 days regardless. They reached out to support on the same, and they canceled my subscription immediately, but I haven't been refunded for both charges. I'm not even sure why I was charged twice when I had only one subscription ID sent to me in the email. The support hasn't responded after I sent them the details. What a scam :( Edit: I have reached to the help twice, still no response"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stay away from Clarify and Fabulous. I was supposed to get a refund weeks ago. Submitted help ticket three times. Nada. Don't waste your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love when I complete a routine, it tries to get me to advertise their company to my friends. I paid $50 to advertise their company, WHAT A DEAL."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is good but u need to purchase premium for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I used to use this app frequently, and I bought a lifetime subscription years ago. I stopped using it because I was in a better space in my life due to using the app to help structure a routine, but now I wanted to use it again, and I cannot restore my premium. I guess it must have just been lost in the update, but I'm really disappointed. I get anxiety with most self help apps that have a monthly subscription, because I feel pressured to use it or I'm wasting money. Otherwise, a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally recommend it if you wanna start a healthy habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app really needs streamlining. The concept is great. But the user experience is all over the place..I used the app back in 2023 and remember it being better. Using it in 2025 - it is extremely bloated. Too many pop ups, even if you sign up to premium the app still tries to sell you more apps non stop. The interface, visuals, and other elements are not consistent and there so no uniform user journey in the app. You really need to get a good UX and UI designer to get things under control."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Notifications wont open"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They stole my money, and won't give me refund don't trust this app. I swear they will make you cry. And now I am having a hard time to get in touch with them because They stole my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a must-have APP. My whole family is using and we enjoy each step ahead toward our goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many habits to take up too quickly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make you go through tests and registration with email just to tell you at the end that you have to pay. I know it's allowed to do these tactics to acquire more users, but I consider it sneaky."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app made my negative thinking become positive.Thank you to the creator of the app and the team"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is just an encouragement for a job well done so far. The team can do greater than this. Your five üåü is sure next realtin because I believe in your creative and purposeful positive ideas."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app is not for me. I find the whole thing hokey and a bit childish. As a writer, I find that the story poems are terribly written, and not at all encouraging. This app might be great for someone else, but I was very disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Trying it for the second time - Finding it hard to stay motivated - I do shift work so its hard to set times unless I keep resetting them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sucks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really helping build a better habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst support app.. waste of money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only just started but it seems to help stay on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money oriented"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have no words to describe how wrong this app and its liok alike ""clarify"" get it totally wrong about people with adhd! First of the never ending quizzes, than the childlike language and interface as if they're talking to w child, the none ending ciomplex questions... WE WANT A NO B.S ORGANISER get to point! An intuitive simple organizer reminder to make routines and complete tasks. Not this holistic child game with nonse questions disrupting you none stop... It never ends! You got adhd wrong"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app charged me over 60 dollars during trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just like its name, it brings all the experience and knowledge together in one place to help you achieve your dream daily habits and routines. Effortless to act on, making habits a reality! Absolutely great. After using it for one and a half years, I‚Äôve realized that daily check-ins are necessary, otherwise a person might slip back into old habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I appreciate and love the app but as a student, I don't have enough for the app upgrade. I would appreciate it if it was cheaper. It's a really great app that had me download ambiance and many others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous! ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Edit: Still fabulous üòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So cool !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They billed me even though I ended my subscription on time. I got an email saying sorry to see you go and immediately after, another email saying they've charged me for a subscription. I had to write to support to get it reversed and they didn't even apologize for the error. Unprofessional at best, scammers more likely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellently written and inspiring coaching audios that offer constant encouragement. Beautiful graphics. Premium subscription comes with three associated apps to find the perfect music for your task, self-affirmation and micro-learnings. I feel like I have a supportive companion with me on my journey. Just a beautiful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for me and I really love it ü¶ãü•πüíúü§çüéÄ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started recently, but so far, so good. Some good meditation training for newbies like me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, I'm habitual for getting into a great habit that lasts for a few weeks, and then it ends. I can say that I finally have a routine because of this app. I've never felt so awake during the day, I actually get out of bed after the FIRST alarm, and not the 2nd 3rd or 4th time it goes off. I love what they do. I questioned the money being worth it, but if it gets me into a healthy routine with eating, exercise, and mental well-being, it's well worth it. Thank you, Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't know why people don't wanna talk much about this app like this is THE BEST SELF DEVELOPING APP"" Highly recommend.lots of love to the creators‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèªüôåüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"From establishing routines for the first time. To re-establishing new ones after seasonal depression, divorce, deep grief, and huge change.... this app has been a pillar of Mt connection to myself, others, and the world that I am co creating. This app allows me to live into my values, priorities, and vision every single day. And it doesn't shame me when I, inevitably, fall off. So so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app!! It's somewhat confusing on the way all of it works. And was kind of hard to keep track of the various different apps and such for some things. Overall I still do Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Hey. I uninstalled this app a week after getting it and I'm fairy sure I cancelled the subscription before the free trial ended. Either way. I've reinstalled it just now to try and cancel the subscription from inside the app as my bank just sne tme a notification AGAIN about this app trying to take money. and I can't find where to do that. You keep trying to take money I don't have. Please can you cancel this. I've not used this app since I uninstalled it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took ¬£14.99 from me when I signed up for the free trial ! Refused to give me a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If there is no free plan, you should state it at the beginning. Tired of scam apps, take 30m interview to collect data and then ask for payment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"ŸáŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸÖŸàÿ¨ŸàÿØÿ©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When an app ask you so many question b4 using means its a scam.who would pay that amount of money for a planner specially a mom?rather use a hard copy planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great graphics and very motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been very helpful in helping me stick to habits and it is encouraging too. I haven't been using it very long but I expect to keep using it. I definitely recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good daily reminders that help keep me on track and provide positive motivation to keep me going."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app and ended my subscription but they keep charging me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Personalized and interactive simply say it all. Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I still need some time to rate but until now it's really refreshing and wipes away all my hate towards myself and gave me hope"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Complete scam. You can't cancel the subscription and they keep taking your money even after you cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unbelievably difficult to cancel. After many emails to get a refund, was just charged AGAIN months after canceling. Complete scam. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty great so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app its a scam. They will extract money from your bank account without even informing you, if you had filled your account details. For more information read the Reddit for this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not much beyond drink water, eat and exercise. Wasn't able to customize to my needs . Double billed when I didn't sign up for subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A subscription was charged off my account even though i had canceled the sub and uninstalled. I not touched this app and from nowhere a subscription is deducted. You obscure your contact information Update - A refund was promised between 5 to 10 days now im on day 15 and the story continues. Am i getting my money back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Emailed to cancel. Never got a response. Was charged anyway. Emailed about canceling and refunding the membership I didn't want. No response. I'm going to have to do a charge back thru my card company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it. Maybe 3* maximum, but hides unsubscribe options so only gets 1"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is too good. I am student so I can't buy the premium but that so good. I wish I could buy the premium one üòì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app that can be very immersive or simple,depending on your needs. My favorite is the checklist and coaching. I would have given it 5 stars, but the subscription is very pricy for what they offer. I have the premium because I was really struggling; it would be worth the price if it had 1 on 1 coach or some kind of therapy along with it. But that in itself is an extra cost!! $$. I hope later the developers dive deeper into the coaching aspect. It is very helpful in the journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me to keep the main thing, the main thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it keeps me on track! It is simple to use. The encouraging messages are wonderful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"(5/12/21) 1week. Pretty good so far. UPDATE: (2/20/25) This app changed my life for the better. I felt more in control of my life, more kindness towards myself - a ZERO GUILT app. It helped me to build positive self regard, which eventually led me to get therapy. Yes, I still use this app. Not all the time. When I need the extra grounding and support it provides. You're going to get out what you put into it. You have to do the work. Self-care is a discipline, not an indulgence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not like this app I canceled this app and they still took $39.99 out of my account I'm going to contact the better Business bureau and I'm going to make sure on every single platform that they know that fabulous and the creators of the fabulous app are thieves"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very comprehensive app with easy-to-follow exercises. I like that it gives you one easy task at a time so you are more likely to stick with it. 02/20/25 update Almost two years later. I am very grateful for this app and for how much it has helped me structure my life around healthy habits. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app does live up to its name. It's the best app I've ever found for building and keeping routines - with highly customizable reminder and alarm settings, and the coachings you can build into each routine really help set the mind and mood right. It also offers guided meditations, and limited-time (ex. 7-day) challenges to focus on something you wish to develop into a habit, even something as basic as making sure you stretch daily. There is also paid coaching if you want more one-on-one help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so so nice I am very happy for I use this app and daily I will use this app so thanku fabulous üòçüòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I liked the app more a couple years back for the way that it was structured, I could find the exercises and meditations with more easy, now they show a lot their other apps. Other than this it still remains the nice and encouraging building habits app and getting back on track. I think I tried it first 6 years ago and ever since I start my morning with a glass of water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app I have found to build habits. Great coaching that works implementing pragmatic application of human nature and strategies. Very well though out app with loads of features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so organised and creative.. It's like it was sent to me.... You're welcome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing, helped my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I've been using it for a couple years now but it's still just as useful for me. It has been instrumental in helping me achieve goals that I never thought I could achieve! I love Fabulous and I think it would be really helpful to anyone who wants to create healthy structure in their life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"COMPLETE TRASH!! This app was good when I first got it. Anymore it just does me no good. My routines never go off. Sometimes it helps if I reset my phone, sometimes not. Sometimes if I reset the alarm after the first one fails the following ones will work but mostly they just don't go off. On top of that if they do go off the alarm bubble will load multiple times eventually locking out anything else on my screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unbelievable!! This app will definitely help it so much more than just a to do list.It saved my life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best one ....it helped me to reconnect to myself again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I use Fabulous and love the way it has helped me grow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the app it's very unique and it's really challenge my life and my emotions üéÄüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Would have been really happy if more journeys were free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Review begged by constant notifications even on premium. It begged me second time although I gave review. I will decrease my review each time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not full of ads, not nonsense, ui is just beautiful and all the journeys and motivations are so, so, omg so very helpful. Loved it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. The format, the ease of use, the prompts sound beautiful, and the coaching helps keep me on whatever track I am"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not only was it not very helpful in the long run, after canceling through Google play, they still charged me out of my PayPal without authorization. Google needs to do something about this scam of an app. -edit- I did get a quick refund after doing the form and then follow up emails that were automated. That being said, they still shouldn't be charging after people canceled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice üåÜüåÜüåÜ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got stuck at one place, asked to tap and hold and that's all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asks to pay.at first place after questionnaire. not able to see the app how it is at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Signifying experience in small steps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps you enjoy life in a better way even when in stress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app, not just for daily routines, but for pushing the reset button on your daily habits, goals, and overall mental health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It provides you a very detailed routine which is for me is a really good point as it's hard for me to plan that meticulously and I often tend to forget so this is a great help ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm really enjoying thos app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a nice app it is!!! I really enjoy every thing, it will give the reminder for your tasks, it is just so soothing, this app understood all my problems and it give a nice routine to get rid of them!!! Thanks a lot FABULOUS‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the Premium Fabulous app. My first night brings calm and an attitude of gratefulness before bed. I can't wait to see what tomorrow will bring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so far. It's making me see that I'm not a lost cause. I just need to change my approach. I'm learning a lot and am excited to continue!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst costumer service ever. Tried to cancel subscription 3 years ago and am still getting charged. Nobody will ever contact you on the phone only emails when it is convenient for them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is incredibly deceptive. I strongly recommend against using it. They decide you by saying you can get a temporary trial for $1, but don't make it clear that they will charge you for a Premium subscription if you don't immediately cancel. I wouldn't use this app unless you want your money stolen. Edit: When I requested a refund, they refused to give it. I recommend anyone thinking about using this app reflects on what kind of a business would have to resort to such dishonest practices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well it really help me to get focus on my study and to be disciplined to my habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"No option to change the routines' alarm sound?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My app is not working They wants my email and I enter my email but the button continue does not tap at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You are charging me AUD$91 and I don't have any subscription!!! How dare you??? What kind of scam is this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing, but the only negative thing about it is that it's paid for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory app. 7 day trial then $65 a year. No other options."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many errors during setup."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I found this app useful.by using this iam slowly achieving my goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Before I even looked at app and filled in email it was money money money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me for something said I had free trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great experience so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I can see how this would help in the long-term. Cheap for what it's worth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thus app changed my life!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Drive your day feeling positive about the outcome and yourself. Careful with the bedtime routine: you've got to complete it before midnight, or the magic vanishes. You are driven to initiate habits that make the best of you. And you can choose which one you tackle next, or let the app propose one for you. Ther are also inspiring readings to kick off the day and to finish it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really a good app with so much to offer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app at all costs. Took ¬£60 from my bank. I didn't even use the app. Contacted them via email to no avail. When I did eventually get on to the app they wanted more money. The free trail doesn't exist. They are con artists. Take the money and go to the pub. I will be getting my Money back at all costs, don't like thieves!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app Is very engaging and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far I think the app is doing good. I'll come back with more feedback once I used the app for a longer time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app for healthy life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It would be nice to be able to make the app more tailored to my routine, the wake up and sleep times for example. Why does it ask me to do begin of day routines as I'm going to sleep? Doesn't allow for plans for the day to change, doesn't allow edits once tasks are set & doesn't offer different times allowed for tasks. They don't all take 30 minutes. I won't stay passed the trail period Edit to add I cancelled and you've taken money from my account. You lost 2 more stars. Awful company"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Attempted to cancel this subscription multiple times and got charged regardless. Customer service refused to refund me. Don't give them any money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I absolutely love this app, and have used some of the others in the suite as well, especially Clarify. I highly recommend it, but do have some issues. Notifications often disappear when clicked on, I got signed out and told to upgrade and lost my streak, and I would like to have more of the features integrated into one app rather than having half a dozen different ones. There are also a lot of redundant notifications. But overall these apps are great and really helping me make healthy changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice and helpful"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app it really is great and I use to use it now I'm using it again and I have a small problem when you decide the app and re-download it, it deletes all your information and progress and that's horrible"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"He just set u reminders and u only should pay for everything literally everything to get any benefit from this app you can't even continue reading the rest of the topics until you pay lol!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far ive enjoyed the app, this is only my first few times using it.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great app, for those who have been stuck in life. Small changes leads to great success and that what's FABULOUS DAILY ROUTINE PLANNER tells you to do. Highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I love the apps themselves and they've helped me massively, but the team behind them are quite absurd and seem to purposefully take your money. I have paid for 5 apps memberships. 1 (shape) i cancelled. Did not recieve a refund. Elixir and Lumiere have bugs (but magically, account not found) now they've cancelled 1 of two i actually use...paid 3 months ago and no refund. This is getting a bit beyond a joke. Just stealing money! UPDATE: contact me in a way I can reply in more than 250 characters."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They ask for $1 to try the app but now Fabulous keeps trying to charge my card for 59.99 even though I only have the basic, free plan. Terrible shady business practice... DO NOT give them your card info!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App tried to charge a load of money to my card without me authorising it, luckily my bank blocked it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app it has helped me with alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I literally just got the app amd just the questioning at the start was so comforting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They made me subscribe to the premium and bundle plan without my knowledge. I lost around Rs 8300(100$) in 2 months! They're not willing to refund apparently. I'm filing a complaint with my bank. This app is a scam! DO NOT INSTALL/SUBSCRIBE!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Feb 11, 2024 Still true despite their response below. Reporting it to my bank. Jan 2025 I can't find where to cancel the subscription. Now I found it on their website on a desktop computer. It says it is already cancelled but I was still billed. It would be fantastic if we could manage subscriptions for all of your apps ON THE SAME WEBPAGE. Apps are Fabulous, Clarify, Lumiere and some new ones that I will stay away from forever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just starting but hopeful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It would certainly put a smile on my face if this app were here only with helping people in mind and without the financial gain! It's way too costly for me and I'm sure others would feel the same. It could have a different layout where the direction to take wasn't so confusing. Other than that I liked it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"App was great, until I needed customer service. I got a new phone and the app asked if I wanted to restore my backups from my last phone. I said yes, and it told me it couldn't until I paid for a Premium account. My membership has billed 4 day prior. After 3 weeks, 4 submissions through the website and 3 responses to canned emails that didn't help, I'm still out $38 and can't get a response from Fabulous. Don't pay for this if you expect you'll ever get a new phone!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love these apps, when I haven't got so many savings goals I will look at getting them back as they had some really great content. Had a bit of a hiccup with payments but this team of superstars fixed it right up for me! Loved the customer support!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam they take your money and then charge you while never giving you access to the premium services. They don't have an actual customer service team just some bs ai. Had to dispute with my bank yo get my money back. Do not download it is a waste of money and time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT GET THIS UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY THE 59.99 PRENIUM. Cancelling the subscription in app is borderline impossible, it doesn't show up in google Play's subscription tracker and the company's support mail is way too hard to find. Smells like a scam to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app in 2022, used it for a couple of days and then cancelled the subscription and uninstalled the app. To my unpleasant surprise, today I saw in my bank statement a charge of ¬£34 from Feb of 2024 (2 years later what?!) and another today (2025). I did not redownload the app let alone reactivate my account. I've been reading online and more people have had issues with dodgy charges from this scammy app. If I were you I'd steer clear from it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm giving 5 stars because the app is amazing, to be honest. And I would definitely love to continue using it. I'm actually premium on this one and Lumiere, also premium. I have downloaded them all. But now I have been having other issues in life that I need to sort first (economically speaking) and I need to cancel this subscriptions. No idea how to. Your app or site won't let me contact support. So, can we please sort this out? What's the email please?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Used to be great for teaching that long lasting habits are built in small steps, but now anything further than that feels heavily AI generated. Same topics circulate in the coaching texts, same analogies, same quotes. Not useful beyond a couple of months"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"EXCELLENT APPüèÜüëçüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They cheated my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I ACCIDENTALLY bought coaching because they push and push upgrades at you when you're signing up. I ACCIDNETALLY pressed yes instead of skip. I reached out IMMEDIATELY and they told me there was nothing they could do. Twice. I reached out again, hoping to explain better and they still didn't seem to understand. Saying I can't get a refund for canceling too late. I never wanted it. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE that I have ever dealt with."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fr it is good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It is great but i thought there are more tools helping in meditation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful. Love the science, facts and exercises. I can really see how things are begining to change. I don't react as much. I consider what I'm feeling and use my tool box that I've composed from tips and hints from fabulous and lumiere."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a FRAUDULENT APP!!! I signed up for a free trial, but they charged me anyway. Then I canceled because I did not like the app and they charged me for an annual membership. After disputing it with my bank, they continued to charge my card over and over and I had to cancel my card because of it. What a hassle. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!!!! It is not worth the hassle of dealing with it!!! Worst app ever!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous user interface. Very pleasing. The app itself is very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I Love this app. One of the best ways to stay true to good habits is to set up a habit-tracking system. Fabulous is the best app for the job Simply tracking your behavior encourages you to change or improve it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My subscription has been cancelled since last year on Google Play but have just been charged and they say it's not eligible for refund, despite it not being an error on my part."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive and helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst...I paid and cancelled...They promised to refund and never reflected on my bank account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app has become much less complicated to use and I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is nothing Fabulous about this app. I thought I'd cancelled by subscription, but they've still charged me ¬£35. I sent their support team a screenshot of my cancelled subscription on their website, but they seem to have ignored that. Like so many others here, I have been caught in their sticky subscription web and can not seem to get out of it. On top of that, the responses from their support team are unhelpful, curt and bordering on rude. I don't recommend this app to anyone. Beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Powerful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"To much question"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't bother getting any of the apps associated with this company, they are all the same layout and completely useless. I got a membership for a bunch of them and there's also no where to cancel them. Emailed support the day before my subscription renewed and they said I'm not eligible. The apps themselves are not worth paying for at all. I thought I was doing something to improve my life but unfortunately not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app for new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got stuck at verify email for an hour and resend email didn't work. Contacted the customer service but won't refund. Avoid this scam of app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been hydrated since I started using app. before now I could go a 12hrs a day without drinking water which effected my health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"After paying way too much for a largely unknown product that talks a lot about its credentials but not a lot about the details of how it's used, I find that I still like what it's trying to do but I'm infuriated with the fact that I have a zillion click-throughs and upsells every time I open the app that I have to click past even though I already gave you a bunch of money... Buyers beware."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great i am very happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really supportive in changing habits and giving coaching to change unhelpful long standing patterns"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Supported me whole.. truly a comfort!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything seems very clumsy and everything is done in automation. I am not getting even a chance to control it, it's doing all by its own."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Premium subscriber. App was overwhelming and overbearing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Slugged me with ridiculously expensive unauthorised charges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really working magic. I am calmer and more focused and getting more done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Whyyy does it have to be subscription based üò´ I would be so much more likely to get it if it was something I only had to buy once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great ways to improve lifestyle and behaviour of any sort of human"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only started it because of the trial, but I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoying it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded it and so far, so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried to cancel my subscription twice and they still tried to withdraw the amount, even though it appears on the site as canceled. Apparently a lot of people had this problem so Fabulous team, I don't think it's enough to give an automated message that directs us to the help center. I've already done that. Maybe you should fix the problem so that you don't get these kinds of reviews anymore"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lots of cool features to keep to wanting to better yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app like crazy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I hate the idea that it requires you to pay just to use the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"my favorite app EVER!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The prompts are helping me focus my attention"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I had this app a few years ago and deleted it because I was happy. Back to using it again, and I still love it. Only lost a star though because of popup ads for premium and the fact that you can only add two habits by choice now instead of four. Great app though!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are thieves..! people..! save yourselves. They told that app doesn't automatically subscribe and charged 1 dollar for trial and then automatically charged 39 dollars and then 29 dollars with out any consent. Plus the app tries to manage you like a robot you cannot explore app on your own there's pet set pattern of navigation that you are required to comply with if you want use app. I guess you subscribe via app but you gotta go 2 website 2 unsubscribe. Save ur money people it's pure robbery"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the approach, incremental habit changes. And it's beautiful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good üëç magical memories of my platform"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless, nothing original, and false advertisement that will take more money from your account than what was advertised. Most of the things on the app are extra and you have to create accounts with each of them or pay extra"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great UI"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It constantly asks you to pay for more features and you can barely do anything without it costing a lot of money. It doesn't seem worth it and I wouldn't pay it, I was concerned to keep using it in case it tricked me into paying something because of the constant pop ups. Sorry. Overall, if you are willing to pay, it does look like a good app but unfortunately not for me who will not pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very stressful app ,alot hidden charges and very hard to navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app and it works also is motivating..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is no free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love everything about it. It's like it was made for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. It helped me get more confident and it made me do more self discipline. I reccomend this app. And I love how you don't HAVE TO pay. And you only pay for premium. Which isn't required"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App best very thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped my wife out so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it It actually changes my habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíñUr app guides very well I like this app very much. The best app I even seen is fabulous daily routine ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüíñIt guides us very politely teaches us how to achieve our goals and many more thing ‚ù§Ô∏è I like this app very much üòÅ ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Maybe it's fine app, but it didn't suit me and I decided to cancel my subscription. It turns out this is impossible to do. Even after them assuring me via email that the auto-payments for me have been cancelled, my card continues to be charged. So irritating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD STEALS YOUR MONEY. I downloaded and tried a subscription 3 years ago. I followed all steps to cancel 3 years ago. Every year it annually charges my card again and I have to dispute it with my bank. The app denies all knowledge. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID They answered to tell me to submit a refund request - I have already done this, they say they can't help then KEEP TAKING MY MONEY STAY FAR FAR AWAY PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD DETAILS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not started yet. Why do you want to sign up with Google account. Rather creating separate username for the App is more secure for the user"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a game changer!üí•üíØ If you're looking to improve your your mind, build positive habits, live with ease and stress-free, I highly recommend this app. This app has completely changed my life for the best yet. It's easy to understand and very simple. I'm a student who has been struggling with so many school related issues, but since I downloaded this app, my entire school life became a ball room in which I am the center of attraction. Very Effective!üíØüéä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with the lack of Arabic language support. The number of Arabic speakers worldwide is around 450 million, making it one of the most widely spoken languages globally, most of us are forced to translate the text before responding. So we couldn't be able to use the app comfortably or effectively. So, I hope you adding an Arabic version. This would give you a broader reach & contribute to a greater benefit for us with your wonderful idea.üá™üá¨"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still trying out the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Warning, do not try the free trial of this app. I cancelled the subscription 4 days before the trial expired and they charged my account $54.99 CAD. I've tried to get a refund but they didn't list the payment. They are thieves."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like the style - cute graphics, but for a 10 year old. Then I canceled before my paid trial ended and they charged my account anyway. Did I forget to say there were foreign transaction fees because they are located in France? Did the company tell me before I was charged? Nope. So I am done with this. Sticking with Calm."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't used it a lot but I'm already in looove, I'm really enjoying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful app I used ever. I've enjoyed to use this. It is much working to develop my daily habits. You have to try it. üòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it helps üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT PUT YOUR CARD DETAILS IN! They continue to charge me after the free trial despite cancellation and they have no way to be contacted. The app is not worth it at all please do not download."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. It is very easy to use and helps me with time management and to follow my routines. I definitely racommend this app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app that keeps u going and being even better than before"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. I love the idea of the app. Just have to give it time, and of course some effort, to see how well the app works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought I'd subscribed to one app. Once I came to cancel my subscription so I wouldn't get charged, I realised I was signed up to multiple subscriptions. So I deleted them all, thinking that was that but the main subscription hadn't come up so it's still taken out first a payment of ¬£30 odd then a payment of ¬£40 odd. These people are taking advantage of vunrable people. They also won't give refunds."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's motivating (really), I hate the word routine because it's practically doing the same thing every day, But the routine I'm developing now is the right one, It makes me feel safe and the app has really motivated me to continue, I find organization, and the intelligent addition of good habits every day. It is ideal and has helped me on my way. The little stories within it are almost magical, All the work put into this app has been functional, Even the voice that narrates makes you feel Correct"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so useful and lifechanger üî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Take time for full experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's not free"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best appüòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel new with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Far from fabulous. Actually unethical. The company targets people & women with ADHD. Claiming to help them but takes advantage of them. When you accept a trial they make you give credit info. You oblige as you want tools for your ADHD. When you go to login, you are met with a very long questionnaire. Which is not ideal for people with ADHD. When you forget to cancel as it has been a nightmare for people with ADHD, beware as no refunds like other memberships. They do not know this clientele."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app for productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its just fabulous üòç"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"In a disquise of choosing 15 people for trials it made me install the app and than after some details came the payment option."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. It builds habits a little slowly for my pace, but maybe this way I'll actually stick to them. Great resources."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I need some guided-organization. This app does that perfectly while teaching me how to do it myself, all in a positive light. I look forward to opening Fabulous every morning! üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm seeing a huge difference in my life eventhough it's only been two days using this app, but it's just a whole miracle that happened in my life ‚ú®Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so thoughtful n planned app...feels like you are the main character and they have curated these beautiful graphics,poems, quotes for you.beatiful is the word for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Total Garbage. Tried the free trial, then got stuck for a month by the terms of the agreement that require you to cancel more than 24 hours before the end of the trial period or get charged $30 for a month of service. I can't even look at the app without feeling tricked. And the only thing it provides is an endless stream of animated positive affirmations and self-promoting clickbait. Ugggghhh! Update: 2 months later I was charged again because I had been signed up for the companion app. Fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Getting all the info what for? Very weird. I don't recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam! App will keep taking money from your bank. Please don't download it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not fabulous. Clunky and hard to use and if you forget to cancel your subscription, even by one day, they will not issue a refund even though you are not using the app at all. Extremely poor customer support, avoid at all costs!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I keep coming back to this app when I feel myself going off course. My favorite part of this app is the creative imagery included because many apps are dull or have too many clean lines. üòÖ I prefer some art in my app for motivation and self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Didn't helped me that much , I downloaded it for time management and study planning but not satisfied"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't like this app. I signed up for trial. Then uninstalled after a few days. I totally forgot about it. I looked at my credit card transactions, realised I got charged by fabulous app 62.99 in December when I don't even have the app nor access it at all way before trial finished. I asked for a refund. They refused my refund request. So again, totally useless app and bad customer service. They never sent a reminder on auto subscribe payment!! Greedy and just want your money when I don't use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app I really enjoy it I wish there are more free features"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I opted for the $1 period and cancelled the trial before the end of the 14 days. I have been charged twice for the membership of ¬£34.99 and ¬£46.99 that I didn't know I opted in for. I'm frustrated that I got charged this ridiculous fee especially when I opted out before the 14 day deadline and deleted the app. Im filing a dispute."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ever since I got a new phone, it keeps prompting me to join premium. I already have premium but it is not restoring my subscription. So frustrating, I refuse to subscribe twiceüò°"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good but limited by preium :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app must try guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Paid subscriber here. I've loved using this app daily for the past year, but the frequent mentions of ""fabulous"" or how ""millions are on this journey"" during coaching sessions feel like unnecessary marketing. As a subscriber, I don't think the app name needs constant repetition. I'd prefer daily coaching to be lighthearted and a positive start to the day without this marketing undertone-it feels off-putting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me stay active, healthy and motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will scam you for money. cancelled my subsciption during free trial and now they have attempted to charge me for the full premium subscription when i only have access to the free version on the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Still not liking the payment method"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed to both Fabulous and Clarify, thought cancelling Fabulous would cancel both since Clarify is owned by them. I was wrong and charged $55.99 twice for Clarify ($111.98 total). When I requested a refund, they refused. Both apps are poorly designed, with distracting visual and sound effects that defeat its purpose of helping people focus and manage time. Also, each app will bombard you with ads for their sister app. Misleading practices and bad products. Avoid both apps at all costs!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UPDATE, these people are taking advantage of the trait for people with anxiety or adhd to either A) forget or put off canceling a subscription or B) feel bad about canceling because this ""science backed approach"" didn't work. How did I end up paying you 60 bucks across 2 subscriptions? What's clarify? This is cutesy little puffin stuff. It's such a shame modern therapy adjacent stuff apparently models itself on kindergarten teachers telling you that you did great on your fingerpaint."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for clarify. They automatically also signed me up for the fabulous premium subscription. I just wanted to do the 14 day free trial so I cancelled before that was over. From clarify. I had not realized that fabulous would charge me. When I found out going over my bank statement I asked for a refund which they promptly refused claiming their T&C are clear stating that that's not refundable. I have never dealt with anything so straight up scammy. AVOID"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like a lot of things on it, I'll know more as I continue to use the application."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really enjoying being supported in setting up routines something I have always avoided"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was very hopeful but found the app busy and overwhelming and canceled the free trail a few days in. I found a charge on my CC that I had not authorized. After requesting a refund for the unauthorized charge I was asked to provide lots of information in order to process the refund. The company needs to get on top of these fraudulent charges and create a much more streamlined approach to issuing refunds. It's all feels very sketchy and intentionally difficult."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been amazing so far in my personal journey, it's only been a few days so I'll update again soon with a better review!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for everything. You can't even have more than 2 habits I don't recommend this app to anyone at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It charged my whole life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Feel comfortable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. Helps with my intermittent fasting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'll looking forward to a better life and this app give sme hope. So I hope you'll join an amazing journey for yourself to better yourself for you and others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the idea of reinforcing habits, but it's hard to find any I want to do EVERY day. Most things, 3x / wk is enough! I have to rotate to care for other tasks the same week. It's good app design, but super New Age / Buddhist language & ideas, which I hate. It stopped me from moving forward, since they want you to agree to their goals 4 u, & their words. Don't talk about ""mindfulness""! Talk about being present or taking a break. No personalizing notifications, either, so they lost 2 ‚≠ê's."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I rated it less because the included apps still don't include a lot of features, despite that I payed for fabulous premium. Also have not updated the guided activity's in more than a year, and ive gotten the same daily&focus coaching talks repeatedly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's best app to use to change your behavior and everything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't find it helpful. To make matters worse, after a couple of weeks of not using the app, I was charged 39.99 for a subscription I didn't want. Expensive and deceptive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a SCAM, this app takes your fingerprint while starting contract when you install it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've just stared, I can't afford premium even with the student budget cuz I don't have a bank account or savings yet, but the options present are very good as well. I especially like the streak map, I wish to go there everyday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im updating my review after 8 years. Still has the same potential to better an individual."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its an optimal habit tracker and supporter. I really like the coaching fragments and how it guides and advices you to get a better result. I give it 4 stars because it does not have a dark style mode."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Thos app encourages the user to feel stressed by: 1. The very poorly laid out User Interface! 2. It is very difficult to find certain adjustments or settings. 3. There are too many popups to get you to try different features before you are ready. 4. 'Self guided' system to encourage the use of various features is too disruptive and intrusive for what I am trying to learn to use with the app. Generally,a PIA to use and learn how to us I have canceled the renewal of my subscription to Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not download this app. I struggle to believe any of the 4/5 star reviews are real. After choosing the cheapest ""trial option"", I was charged over ¬£80 for a subscription I never agreed to. Absolute scam. I will be amazed if I ever see that money back. Aside from the scam nature, the app is completely useless. Spend ¬£5, buy a journal and a pen, it'll serve you better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love how interactive this app is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Purchased after seeing an advertisement that this app helps different personality types find their ideal routine. I found no personality tests within the first hour of using. Reached out to their customer support and was advised that this app does not offer personality tests, and they confirmed that there is no feature to find an ideal routine based on personality type. You set up your own routine and can customize what habit you want to work on. That's it. So why falsely advertise? Zero stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Might be useful, though a contract for a minimum of $50 just to try is far too much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got charged INR 8300 rupees for not using the app at all. They have made cancelling subscription so difficult that it doesn't exist on the app. Despite having uninstalled and not used the app, they denied providing refund. It was my 15 day salary and I have to face this punishment for not using the application. I would really request you to provide refund ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Haven't got to use it yet will check back in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammed me after using g a free trial now I have to continue paying until April (its currently January)"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"loving it üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good and heloful app though I'm still starting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"PREDATORY. I, a person struggling w/ my adhd, downloaded in a desperate moment. 1st, an unskippable quiz. Then, you can't get the results unless you pay a dollar for a trial. I missed that I would be automatically signed up and charged after the trial. A predictable mistake for one w/ adhd. I've never used the app, but have been charged odd sums adding to over $100. I missed the charges, as an adhd person might. They won't refund or even explain the individual charges. I was targeted and scamed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have forgotten to cancel my subscriptions. I am being charged 59.99 and 39.99. Support has told me that I am unable to be refunded. I am furious. I enjoyed the app. But can not afford it right now. And I am now being ripped off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. The only annoyance is all the in app ads for other apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's been amazing using this app for a week now, I must confess I love it ‚ù§Ô∏èüíÉüíÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"When u use this app u really feel many changes in your life. Even in some days u started those habits without alarm or anything. Everyone have to try this for a disciplined life.üíìüíìüß¨"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had really bad postpartum depression with my 2nd son and couldn't even get myself out of bed. This app saved my life during that time. It helped me build habits and guided me one baby step at a time. I was able to get mentally and physically fit enough to find my extinguished confidence, heal from my depression, and end my toxic relationship. For anyone struggling because of stress, burn out, ADHD, or anything making it hard for you to remember to care for yourself, I would HIGHLY recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is good no doubt... But as a student it is little costly to purchase the premium. If only the prices comes down..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app give me life again after severe abuse"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"These app has been a game changer to me i.love it"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I find it interesting and a program which will help me improve my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 stars because it seems user-friendly, but I haven't even used it for 12 hours yet, so I'm not sure how it will work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Geart app I really enjoy it and like that you can add your own habits. I only wish some of the guided meditations and journeys weren't behind a paywall, like we could watch an ad at the beginning or end. Edit: I've bought the paid version and it is worth the money, I really love being able to restart a journey and recently I restarted the app from scrap. And all I had to do was uninstall, if you fall off the wagon; pick yourself back up and do it again. I hope my fellow travellers are doing well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a complete scam. They offer you a $16 2-week free trial but then sneakily charge you $67 & sign you up for three expensive subscriptions without telling you and they refuse to refund it or cancel them. This app is supposed to be helping neurodivergent people not taking advantage of them! Save yourself! UPDATE: this response was unhelpful. My refund request was denied without explanation and I was told to cancel the policy myself. No customer service. No care. Not even any interest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulous preys on ADHD users' executive dysfunction to keep charging them. üî¥ Canceling is much harder than subscribing‚Äîclassic predatory behavior. üî¥ They ignore refund requests & rely on users giving up. If you're considering subscribing, don‚Äôt. If trying to cancel, document everything & prepare for a fight. This app claims to help neurodivergent users but exploits them instead."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good very"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"You can't set tasks for any other day but ""today"". I wouldn't use this app even if it was free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am relatively new to this app but so far it's been good, it's helped me implement small changes to my day and the habits are building at a comfortable rate. I do wish it would stop trying to get me to use it's other apps everyday when I complete a habit but apart from that I am enjoying using this app to help me change my day and be more productive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Well... I loved the app. Canceled my membership bc I felt like I got what I needed from it & it's still charging me. I'll be filing this as fraud with my bank."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fishing for dollars in my bank account after canceling. After canceling and receiving confirmation the app is still fishing for money in my account for different amounts. Inhad to block them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive app that challenges you without the pressure! ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Feels cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it make me stay focused and motivated üí™"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Don't verify your email and only pay through the app if you choose to. The website wouldn't track with the app that I verified my account and paid for a month's long trial (through the verification page link and for a lower rate). I ended up going through PayPal to cancel the reoccurring subscription because support was unable to help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"didn't find it helpful for my self but that's not what the one star is for. it's for them still charging me for the subscription I cancelled them trying to say that I didn't and am having to dispute the charge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Was amazing and works wonders, but for some reason the notification for my bedtime routine just made my phone buzz every second and wouldn't stop until I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, if they fix this bug it will be a 5* review."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's my 4rd time going back, the first time I tried was 3 years ago. It's life changing, but definitely needs to be done with a budy to keep you accountable. If you're serious about making a change, is really worth it üëå üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this and verified my email, but it redirected me to the website instead of the app and I answered everything and when I tried to use the app it tried to have me do everything again and I just got annoyed and deleted it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Apps like those are really good tools to get to where you want and to find what you are looking for,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best habit forming app so far. Helped me build really great habits slowly and steadily and with proper guidance!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did love this app, but there's clearly a problem with how the company is run. No one replies properly to any problems or glitches. The agents that did respond to queries months ago, (maybe beginning of the year, not had any proper replies since beginning of August) don't know how the apps work. I have the Fabulous, Lumiere and Lune app... And they ALL have problems. Fabulous... You need to hire more staff and train them! Edit: reply to developer... The evidence says to the contrary."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware. I was charged for things I did not consent to and when I immediately brought it to their attention they told me I could not have a refund.. I will be filing some complaints with FCC and BBB. Admin please delete my info and make sure all future business is canceled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One of the worst apps I have used. The design of the app, not so great. They're still billing me WAY after cancelling the subscription AND deleting my account. What is even the point of this?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Subscription cost is too high for poor people it's not possible to buy everything. It will be helpful if you take some considerations and make price lesser for those out there who need more help but can't get them because of barriers like these. Otherwise the app is very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is outstanding like you are talking to yourself, just like your soul mate understand you better than anyone else. Good Job by the Fab Team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Extremely poor support, even for premium customers. Would never recommend anyone to get this app and definitely not the premium subscription. I have been trying to get my premium subscription through gympass enabled and tried everything mentioned in the support docs. Still doesn't work. I tried emailing customer support and it's been a week and multiple emails, yet no response. Very disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is good for life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There r telling me to pay before doing most things.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps in meditation and routine building. continuously using from 20 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very much üíûüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This would have been a nice app if you didn't have to subscribe to do anything, absolutely can't do anything unless you subscribe. So what's the point of it being a free app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Actually, I Don't know how to use or that app problem. It's had fantastic vision but literally hard to use. The app management should applied the explanation how we can use it and app has nice sound picture that's I like more!! Good enough! But he explanation is needed that bad in this app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent app with tiny details to help understand and implement habits in an easier way. Four stars for the effort and one vacant for future advancements. Thank you Fabulous team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A waste of time! I have been using the free trial for a few days now. In the morning when I open the app I have the option of clicking on ""my morning routine"" which asks if I drank water. Click yes and it congratulates me. Then it tells me a short story about making the journey to happiness. Whoopdy do! Does the same in the evening for brushing my teeth and 30 minutes of reading. Beyond that, the entire app is filled with things you can click on, which are actually other app by the creators."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Peekaboo I like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will start charging you as soon as you put your payment details in. I was very very careful and thought I didn't click on subscribe when I noticed the ridiculous amount they charge, but they still charged me even tho I never activated my account. Wouldn't reply to my emails and refused to give me a refund. Daylight robbery. After I contacted the support team still no refund. Why did you even comment?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very interesting app this is..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am really loving this app. The set up is very user friendly. The challenges are appropriate and not very hard... so far, you just gotta have faith and be all in and let the process lead the way. They give gently nudges and reminders to help you stay on track, and lots of praise, information and motivation to keep the morale up. I'm extremely grateful I came across Fabulous and am very excited to enbark on my journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money grabber and useless. App keeps sending me back to beginning and wants to charge me again and is loaded with upsells up front before you can even do anything with app. It charged my PayPal once and I have the receipt. Also reporting to Google since it circumvents google for IAP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can never verify my email address and I want to cancel my subscription but because I cannot verify my email I cannot open my full account which will allow me to cancel my account. Why charge $55.00 a month if I cannot access my account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription and still got charged. Completely unacceptable, I'd give zero stars if possible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I thought I'd try it. Jumped through all these hoops, paid $1 for 2 weeks AND THEN found an email in my inbox that I should've had 30 days for FREE. So now I'm paying $1 for only 2 weeks. So dumb. And thus far, my exploration of the app is that it's pretty mid. I expect I'll likely end up canceling it. I don't have the time or inclination to read a ton of stuff just to set up a habit of drinking water every morning. Something I already do. Very disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would have kept it and gave it 5stars of it was a free app, you can't help people be better if U r trying to profit out of their health and mental issues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent habit builder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is very good I feel very good after downloading this app this is be my fav"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"i like this app in theory, but there's so much clutter. So many notifications, so many things to tap through when doing a task, so many irrelevant things on the dashboard :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The registration process is flawed. The confirmation email only redirects to the website, and even if you complete the process, the app still gets stuck at the email confirmation step. Skipping it doesn‚Äôt help; you have to start the entire process over again. The website and the app are so disconnected that even canceling a payment requires figuring out where you were charged‚Äîon the app, the website, or the store. You even have to pay for the trial period. I don't recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great experience with the app , I feel more energized since I started using the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good work... so far im improving myself üíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me with my ADHD my stress levels and it helped me with my perfect morning routine I love this app so much download it right now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even though subscription was not used. A refund could not be processed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started this app in 2020 and I still carry a lot of the habits with me 5 years later!!! Personally I like to take a break from using it but come back later to start up again. Great way to reset when feeling in a slump. I Wish the app did have a widget so I could check mark my progress from my home screen like many apps do. Just a suggestion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A terrible rip-off + they make it so hard to unsubscribe! Signed up for the free trial, next thing I know I've been charged **$63** for a 2 month subscription. If you Google the app, it says the *annual* premium is $39, but they charge you nearly this much per month and all you are signing up for is obnoxious notifications telling you to take challenges and meet goals. Tried to unsubscribe via the app, but it diesnt let you. Have to sign in via a website & jump through hoops. AVOID THIS APP!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and enjoyable app to help with focus and establishing a daily habit of positive mental goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Am a starter. Am yet to find out how good it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dodgy! Subscription model - The sign up process feels like a hijacking! They ask for personal details before revealing the price and annual autorenewal terms. It's very difficult to cancel. I was only able to access my account and cancellation options after a lot of effort. Unsubstantiated credentials - There is no information anywhere about who runs the app or what they base their program. No one is taking accountability or offering any kind of credibility for offering mental health support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pure Garbage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's changing my life. I struggle with executive function and now I'm about to do all the little habits I've been meaning to build for years, even when I don't have the motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far thinking this will do me well, let's hope I can stay consistent üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great to make better habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day 1 but so far I love it. Easy to use. Easy to setup. And it makes the habit tracking pretty easy. Update: This app is absolutely amazing! I'm 15 days in & let me just say that it's become an essential part of my everyday life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's too expensive and keeps trying to take money after cancelling subscription. App is annoying to navigate or won't let you navigate it. I liked this app because of one of the fitness things it has which you unfortunately can't use unless you have a subscription. But the subscription is like $60 for 3 months and it's not something affordable for low income people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: I'm still fighting to get my money refunded. What a scam. Do NOT sign up for the free trial, you will be charged, even if you cancel before the trial ends and they'll charge you for a 2nd app too. I was charged twice, totaling almost $70, even though I cancelled before the end of my trial. I've been trying to get this refunded for a month now. The customer service must be a bot, because it continually asks for information that I've already provided."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash app with trash customer service. Wish I could give a 0."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Made a ¬£9 payment to try out for two weeks can't set up any plans without being asked for more money or to sign up.for member ship total scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful appüòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like how we start small and then the tasks increase but they are very manageable to do"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is scam! You agree on free subscription and suddenly you're being charged without any notice!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Accidentally been subscribed for years. They don't remind you of upcoming charges or anything. I only found out because I checked my CC statement. Removing subscription is a nightmare. They keep asking you to try different things before actually allowing you to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's my first day and I did enjoy this app it's worderful. I have tried many apps but finally found something which suits me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is almost exclusively advertisements for other apps, presumably published by the same company. No matter how frequently I try to dismiss the onslaught of notifications, I am constantly prompted with up-selling for nightly coaching, personal training sessions, and the like. After every single completed routine I have to dismiss the option to gift the fabulous app to 5 friends. I'm realizing that making a checklist in Notes and ticking it off every morning & night is 10x better than this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I give 4 stars for now. So far so good I am out of my comfort zone. As well I have already started to program healthier, love thyself, care for myself more and being less stubborn and rebellious, learning to adopt new ways to better my life and in doing this, today your app advertisement came across a video I was watching. So here we go and let's see what I can adapt to and give myself a better, stronger, solid foundation with routines that are positive and needed for me to feel üíØ whole.üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app was really amazing üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app but the pop up ads are annoying, why am I seeing ads for their other apps when I'm paying membership fees?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's really good but it could be better if more things were free..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's annoying me a LOT. It might work for other people but the constant dinging does not work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very helpfull aplication"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have canceled service, un-installed the app, and no subscription is listed in Google play, yet they are still trying to charge me $39.99?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled this app but they are still taking money out of my account, I've uninstall the app so no way of contacting and cancelling this despite changing my bank .... still took ¬£23.99 out of my account which i cannot afford."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me for the year, then turned off my premium and canceled it without giving my money back. Scam company so NOT USE!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a couple days in, but I really appreciate how this app has you build one habit for a couple days before they add a new one to start ingraining. I think it is going to be a very helpful tool in being more productive and healthy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I've been super pleased with this app. I am planning to subscribed for a year to commit and see how it helps with the ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The game is really nice I really recommend I give it a 5-star review because it's actually I really good routine planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's a good app, helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm not mistaken, my plan has been cancelled since the 9th a Jan and the fabulous app tried to charge me again today. 0 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"haha keep wanting to use it and forget"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is good for discipline"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"very frustrating. It had a very lengthy onboarding process I was tricked into after clicking the explore option over register now. This option aggregated some very personal lifestyle info while seeming as a helpful new friend. This was not the case. feeling like I finally would get to explore it asked for email. ! Ehh just want to test it. I didn't want to but this may help so i gave in. JUST TO BE GIVEN A PAYMEMT SCREEN! Not helpful/friendly they got my info and I didnt even get to try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app literally tried to withdraw an entire subscription amount of $39.99 from my debit card 3 separate times. I installed the app and paid the $1 trial fee to check it out. Once I saw the subscription fee and I realized I couldn't afford it, I canceled my trial and uninstalled the app! Then a few days ago I was notified of suspicious activity on my card and it was denied. THANK GOD!! But now I have to order a new card and I had togo to my card account and block FABULOUS merchant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's interesting, try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very gentle and encouraging app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been a paid subscriber to this app for several years now. Absolutely nothing compares. From the self care exercises and routines to the motivational life lessons and platform that connects you with other users. My only regret is not finding this sooner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Divine guidance"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so far. Only on my second day but yeah I'm liking it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only on the trial and it already feels like exactly the thing I've been looking for. Also using the Clarify app and I helped me so much with my work flow yesterday! Love the little motivational readings and quotes too, and the fact it's developed by a university researching behaviour change makes it all feel really positive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They have been trying to charge my card since Jan 4th and I had to block them. Went to their site this morning and cancelled my subscription and they STILL tried charging my card this evening. Think twice before giving them your credit card information. Super sketchy üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent and helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nope!!! I canceled premium long before my subscription trial ended and uninstalled the app. Today, they charged my account $29.99 for the Clarify app. I've never downloaded or used this app. They quickly reimbursed me, but it was inconvenient to have to track them down for an unauthorized purchase. It feels especially scammy, considering they are appealing to neurodivergent people who may struggle with tasks. Stay away!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"cool app, but only 2 habit max for routines?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very engaging app and definitely keeps you interested with all the interactive options. First time trying an app of its kind"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for getting in a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I thought subscribing to premium would give me more control over entering my own tasks and timers, but no. I find the motivational stuff to be more airy fairy fluff than real nitty gritty help. Update: What bothers me is that I don't get to decide what is doable and important to me. I understand the starting slowly, but it's like you're acting like a controlling parent who removes the power from me, deciding WHICH habits I may start on first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really working for me!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ I am the queen of procrastination, but with Fabulous, I am beginning to get my life in order. Soo refreshing üòçüòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too busy and pushes extra services and ads all the time. Pushes you to get others to join. More of a stress than a help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The reminders are super helpful and keep you on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged 16.41 for basically nothing. They try to sell subscriptions every time you try to work with it. Naturally no refund. It's a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far im feeling Good about this app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I rate this app 3stars because this app is not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Complete and total scam. You sign up with a ""$1"" subscription and then spammed with ""offers"" so much that you can't get anything out of the app. This is the first time I have said this but if I could give negative stars I would. Should have been suspicious when all the ""developer"" responses are in seriously broken English."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow what an amazing app so far. FINALLY SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME REAL HOPE OF CREATING A NEW ROUTINE AND REBUILDING LIFE AFTER NARCISSISTIC ABUSE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app, helped me to get my morning routine straight and hopefully with help in many other ways."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me overcome my depression. I don't have it installed anymore, but I wanted to tell anyone struggling that this all is a great tool :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am glad I found this app which helps me a lot as a new user"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm ready"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I'm sure this app is great if you pay, but unfortunately the insistence that you upgrade from free every 10 seconds doesn't give you the chance to see. I realise that there is a free trial, but I will be billed after 14 days and as I signed up for this to help with ADHD, there's a huge chance I forget and get billed a months worth of groceries."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good app, for change!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helpful Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"NOT for anyone with ADD or ADHD. Cluttered, overwhelming, difficult to navigate, couldn't focus on anything long enough figure out how to add goals or change them. There are apps that are way more user friendly and not such an assault on your senses"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm glad to experience the greatness of fabulous daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been living with ADHD for most of the 21 years of my life. A discovery I didn't even consider to be possible until a couple weeks ago (I thought I was just your common joe who needed to do more and try harder). And now, getting help is all I want, so I'm hopeful that this app will help to overcome some of these struggles by building healthy habits that actually stick. I haven't been using this app for very long, but I'm hopeful. I'll update y'alls on my progress after a couple more weeks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A well structured life changing app recommended to everyone who wants to take life seriously. Easy to navigate and colourfully beautiful and economical in subscription. I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was ready to start using this service. Paid for the subscription and everything problem is they dont have my payment and it was debited from my account and when you dispute they blame you when it is not you but them that did not registered the payment you made. I would say dont bother... they suck!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful App, thanks for creating this support system."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Missing integration with 3rd party software else it is a very nice app with lot of efforts and attention to details that coaches you toward success"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self improvement/selfcare"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish I could afford this... If I could I feel it would really help me get my life on track well what I think it should be like ü§∑ until then I guess free trial is as good as I can get .. thanks fabulous I appreciate you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It starts pushing you for subscription before trying the app, which was really annoying to me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing app !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad... It's everytime asking for subscription then what's the use of mine to download this app... Even if it wasn't subscription on every steps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm starting to take actual responsibility for my procrastinating plus the plus side is figuring out what I want in life and how I'm gonna get there ‚ù§Ô∏è! Thank you Fabulous üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took ¬£56.99 out of my account and refusing to refund even though I did not confirm I wanted to pay this. I only wanted a free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This game is helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great! Really helped me so much. It's worth every penny! (2020) Back after a little break. Still love the app. So many habits were still in my daily routine! (2025)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Now only joined , it's an app with payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The best app for a healthy and positive lifestyle üëåüèø"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"AVOID. No refunds. No warning of charges. No customer service. Impossible to cancel - they'll just keep charging you. More useful apps out there without these issues. I want my money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"you needpremium to do alot & IDC if it's cheap, why is well being app constantly trying to make you spend money, and trick you into spending money and buying premium, lame"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app for forming and tracking healthy habits and for encouragement. It has some rare glitches, but overall, it's pretty wonderful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the 7 day free trial and didn't really like the app, so tried to cancel my subscription on the first day of the trial in the app. I wasn't sure if it went through because it kept glitching out during the cancellation so I contacted support. I haven't heard back from support. Not only did the cancellation apparently not work, I was charged for the annual membership on the second day of the trial! They are stealing money from people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice app its amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The main app is excellent and it is genuinely helping me. The only thing I would like to change is being able to add just one of the many other apps in the ""bundle"" set, rather than paying a fortune for them all. I would happily pay a little extra but the full amount for the bundle of extra apps is just too high, and I don't need them all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been struggling to maintain routines all my life. I came across this app by chance and without expecting much I thought ""might as well try a free trial.."" and it has really been a game changer - the ambient music and little motivation messages at each habit, as well as collecting streaks and the beautiful aesthetics have really helped me establish a morning and evening routine that have improved my wellbeing ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An Amazing App I've ever found üòç Alhmdulillah it helps me alot to make Myself better day by day ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice for tracking habits and helping reframe, but SEVERELY not worth $20 a month when there's plenty of free tracking apps, mental health resources and forums for discussing the like. You also stole the shortcut on pixel to get to my normal alarm/timer/stopwatch and Id like the setting to get it back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"O sum üåÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"over stimulating, complex to navigate, & time consuming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total Rip Off! Signed up for a free trial. They overcharged my credit card right away by adding ""couching sessions"" which I did not have mostly got charged for another App they were promoting I checked out the app, Clarify, but never downloaded nor did i ever activate the app however, this company did NOT care and did NOT refund me a penny when I realized they were charging me Do NOT do business w this company TOTAL FRAUD!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible app: overwhelming and not helpful. It also tries to scam you even after you cancel the subscription. I was charged even though I cancelled it long time ago"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"total scam. charged me ¬£100 subscriptions without me verifying, very difficult to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No way to cancel membership... Feels so scammy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Response to reply: I did contact and I did request a refund and was denied even though I sent proof of the date the subscription was cancelled. Do not subscribe to this app unless you want to waste a lot of time trying to get your money back. I signed up for the free trial and cancelled it within the period to avoid a charge. I was charged anyway and charged again a month later. I might have to cancel my credit card just to keep them from charging me again for nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying it I love all the options it haves for me I will slowly build on it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a well designed app and helps in remembering actions that I want to turn into action. I waste less time and try to do them to tick in Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app it help me to make habits and improve myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The application is so good do I play good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Premium app, everything u click need subscription to open Those who wanna pay could surely go for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really a good way to know someone has your back covered üòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a free app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful for habit building and goal target setting.üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm off to fullfill my devine Destany"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I couldn't use it at all, from the beginning they constantly push you to get the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Love this app!! So helpfulüòÉ BUT it really needs a pay-once option which I thought I managed to opt in for, but it still reads as a monthly subscription in my accountü§î Also, this app DOES NOT allow you to use it across multiple devices. I initially installed it on my tablet, but I can actually only access the app on my phone even when signed in with the same email. But I use my tablet WAAAYYY more so this makes it really inconvenient to use, esp. at night when trying to stay away from my phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been paying for all 3 apps and unable to cancel or download the other 2 for several months with no help from support. Asked for refund and they said no. Out several hundred and overdrafted on an account I rarely use. App is visually cute but that's about it. Very disappointed. I was hoping to use this in conjuction with my regular therapy but just got scammed instead. No other apps have given me such trouble I feel like a boomer."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I accepted an offer to subscribe, downloaded the app but cannot login. I tried both with my email and Google account, it keeps loading after I enter my information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best App graphics for keep us using and loving the app, while we are changing to our best version too...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tis is very unique, masterpiece, Great Concept, and really Very Fabulous App.üî• It appreciate me and make Perfect Remainder to acheive something... I just Love for this appüíï The Best Routine planner.... But, Also one thing that i not like from this app that is It most time ask for purchase the membership and aprt from this Many other useful activities are locked due to membership, üòïSo please check it and Think it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is only my 2nd day with the app, haven't really had time to look it over or anything. I got a message from ""Coach"" this morning and it told me what I needed to do. So far as I've seen I'm liking it and positive it will help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like it so much but unfortunately u need to pay after one week on this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app! Its incredibly helpful, useful, has great sounds, lessons, music, habits... I didn't hesitate to become a premium member. HOWEVER! I do wish there was a little more guidance for some of the activities/habits, as some of them are just journaling like the habit of ""overcoming fear"" (iirc). Either way, the pure journaling-based habits are not exactly helpful for someone like me who really likes a lot of guidance. But the habits that DO have guidance are really helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Can we please have a widget created for the tasks so that I can tick them off from my homescreen?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far great! Let's see how i do"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This was too basic for my needs. I'd prefer to get my money back. Just not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paying customer. There's a lot of app advertisements on the home screen now and you can't move/delete them. No, I'm not downloading 8 other apps and paying for them too,lol. I was showing a friend the app saying it's nice that the todo list isn't overwhelming in the mornings and then they saw the barrage of content on the home page and got scared off :/ I got excited when the app mentioned ADHD but there are no obvious changes/help from years ago except a useless/empty ADHD community board."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If possible I would like to give a zero rating, no refund given. When you don't need the app especially since I don't see any confirmation for subscription. I deleted the app but have to fight for a refund I don't see any subscription confirmation for and I haven't used the app once and yet the refuse to refund. It would be okay if I did use it or if it were helpful. And 'apparently' I subscribed with Google pay but it isn't even recognized in my Google subscription or Google pay for a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a masterpiece, but it needs to have a few things left in it ü§£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"so far been pretty good and I usually don't get anything outta these apps. put forth the effort it's worth it I say"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"$54.99 was taken from my bank account on December 26th despite cancelling prior to this. Now they won't respond to me at all. I'm going to have to report an unauthorized charge to my bank now because I have proof of cancellation before they charged my card."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Please add widgets and calender integra, that would be very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Different; challenges me to think outside of my comfort zone - if that's too trite to say. Kind-hearted, encouraging approach, rather than being didactic; I can take what I want and leave the rest behind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, best app I've used. Very well structured"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's good but there's a lot of payed things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to cancel the subscription! You can't do it in the app or here on Magazine play. You have to go and search their website, log in to your account on their site and cancel your subscription there. At first I just wanted to see how to cancel my subscription in case I will want to do it at some point, but when I saw how hard it is to cancel I just cancelled it because it feels like they want to trick you to pay their subscription because it's too hard to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There is just too much. I hate reading things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Definitely should make more clear this is a paid service. It is so disheartening to go through the entire sign up process to be hit with a fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Legit sucks it just wastes your time trying to make you subscribe and pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Still can't get the app to reflect the paid membership. AND can't get a response or refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for continuity your growth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how interactive the app is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Although the app is very helpful, it's very frustrating that I can't record previous days progress if I couldn't find time to record it in the same day. It would be better if this feature was added."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"billed me after I canceled during the trial. THEY billed me twice. I used it less than 1 day. STAY AWAY"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been amazing for helping my with my anxiety and self doubt. Just like anything else, you get what you put in and with this, you have to put in the time to reflect on the lessons, which are well written and very inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"engineered to steal your money and make it hard to cancel. DO NOT EVEN DO THE TRIAL!! this is one of those apps that is developed mostly to scam your money. when I went to cancel my trial it wasn't listed in my subscriptions. I had to search online. when I finally found a way to cancel it said I had multiple apps I registered with even tho I didn't . thank God I checked because they had a ""bundle plan"" taking money out as well that was almost impossible to cancel BEWARE THEY ARE THIEVES"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Free version: you DON'T have to input your payment info in order to try the app! That's for a free trial of premium, and if you X out of the 7 day free trial screen, you'll find yourself in the free version of the app. (And sometimes offer discounts if you do try premium). Overall the behavioral science works pretty well, but the layout of the app can be confusing. It'll either help you or it won't, so I would recommend trying the free version for two weeks to anyone thinking about premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My experience with this app has been really good so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been sending emails, and no one is getting back to me. I canceled the app, and it says it's states, so in my Google subscriptions, however, there has been an annual subscription deduction. I can't even access the app! I want a refund! No one is responding. There's no subscription because it was canceled, so I can't request a refund. Please assist!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just start using the app, but the expreience is great so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I only just started, but this app already made me want to cry with how kind it feels to read all this encouragement. And the daly quests seem interesting and engaging; I can really see myself succeeding with this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really couldn't get on with this app at all. The look and feel seem messy to me. There's a suite of apps, instead of just one. It's not intuitive, I can't work out what it does or what the point of it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Seems good and helpful just a littlw reliant on a subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a self mentor app which helps us to get in a right track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"was offered a premium free trial, next thing I know I'm charged 40 dollars out of nowhere. tried to contact but no one picked up. how convenient. tried to cancel membership I didn't sign up for in the app, was told I had to go to the web, had to sort through metric ton of pages through their site while being bombarded with offers. finally got to cancel but still lost 40 bucks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has brought positivity into my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just started will adjust stars if it starts working."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"3 star üåü But it should have been free offline mode"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very good and so encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for the 2 week trial. Confirmation email wouldn't work, could not log into the app, and when requested refund I was denied"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing! I've used the app daily for several months now. Love it. Trust the process and take it one tiny step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, great guided learnings and lessons."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got scammed. Bought a $1 two-week trial that never materialized."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've never felt more rage at an app. I signed up 4 times, paid a fee and then kept getting directed to pay a much larger fee! massive waste of a lot of time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muito boa"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Still waiting for a refund after being charged a second time when I'd been told that everything was cancelled and no more payments would be taken."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate it SO much. First, it forces the user to agree to a contract that didn't even have my name right, but there's NO CHOICE but to agree to it to get into the app. Then, they force you to sign on to a goal about drinking water. Again, giving the user NO CHOICE but to agree in order to continue. By then, I just wanted to cancel my membership, which was one last insult. They make the user choose one of their reasons for leaving, none of which is, ""This app is truly awful."""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Really frustrating that the free version doesn't allow you to do almost anything. I really wanted an app to help me make stronger routines and keep me on track, but I don't have money to spend on an app. And there isn't a lifetime option either. So you don't really get to try out anything before you decide to purchase. You can only add one item to your routine, then it's just, GIVE ME MONEY. The visual design and flow of the app is great. I just wish I could try more before needing to pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App did nothing except blast stupid music at random times without me opening the app. Deleted. *edit* they think I mean reminders. I don't. I mean the app blasted music continuously until I closed it. A reminder is a tone, a beep, something that lasts a second. This was playing music like Spotify, except I hadn't opened it. Fix your response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It seems like a good app if you want to start at the beginning and will guide you through every step but it wants you to pay money immediately it barley lets you do anything for free it also seem a bit slow and i cant focus onitwithmy adhd (I personally use routine flow and its great if you now what your goals are and its much cheaper)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day one of starting the trial and having the app provides me with a system for living my day with intention"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi i opted for a 1 week free trial on 1st jan 2025 but i was charged rs.1399/-. I contacted support portal and left 3 emails on the same day and today to issue me a refund. But no response yet from faboulous team. Kindly issue the refund as soon as possible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"All are like fairy and well but taking subscription by High amount"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just downloaded the app today, I wish there were more prompts and suggestions as to 'popular' tasks to track so I knew where to start and what things are good to track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm currently unemployed and wanted an app to help me organise myself, and feel better about myself so I can stay motivated in getting a job. But so far all this app has done is constantly push the premium subscription onto me which makes me feel even worse as I cannot afford it at the moment! Please stop asking me to pay when I've already said no. After reading all the good reviews I feel a little disappointed. I'll delete the app for now and when I can afford it I may come back and try again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't trust this app. After downloading it I found it to be way too pushy. I want accountability but I don't want to constantly be on the app answering questions. When I went to cancel it wasn't super easy. I had to do some searching and jump through some hoops to cancel. On top of that I realized I was subscribed to other apps I wasn't even aware I had signed up for. This app feels like it's more of a money grab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app to understand and apply behaviour science in real life if you want to commit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So appreciated!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very poor aap. Full of waste your imp. Time because it takes all information about you and then it solicit the money Rs-1400 approx."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like having your best friend by your side 24/7"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Seems easy to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's too much going on in the app. Too much advertising their other apps and features I don't care about. And that's as a premium user. Likely a lot worse for free users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spotted they have been charging me ¬£34.99 every three months without being authorised, do not give your bank details!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think it's really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually it seems their refund policy is also good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I truly thought this app could help my life. but I couldn't sign in maybe don't do all of that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"DIAGNOSED grade 5 -ADHD & FAS no adults to guide me any one to tell me what to do age 13 I left home life flys by.

This app has helped me build Routines and habits+ life skills now learn coping & $ ‚è∞ cleanin to do lists Thank you fabulous@ developers you ROCK ü§ü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app seems really comprehensive and helpful without being too annoying in it's reminders or too cheesy in it's encouragements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In my first exercise üí™ i took in the app and went successful it a it a great app to change your life if you want a change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"nice so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Premium Subscriber. The concept is great, but the execution is horrible. The goal of the app is to essentially help neurodivergents but the app itself is overwhelming, confusing, not easy to follow, and blows you up with unnecessary notifications. The Premium subscription doesn't allow a customizable approach either. Also, when you go to cancel, they make you jump through hoops."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was signing up for free trial. Hit wrong button. 160 euros later I realised this is a scammy app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful they take advantage of people with adhd"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me on track and boosts my self esteem. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The apps are very good, useful and fun. However, they push new products at you and are funny about the billing and make it difficult to unsubscribe. ~~~~ Additional note. I got an offer for a years membership at a discounted rate, so Ive gone for it, it's a fun little app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged the annual subscription fee before the free trial was up. At some point they will require you provide them with a card number to keep using the app and will call it a free trial, but they totally charged my card days before they should have, and didn't even notify me. Fortunately, I noticed and I was able to fill out a refund request with Google Play and got the subscription refunded. I uninstalled this horrid little app right after."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used the Premium version of this app a few times and found it mostly unhelpful. I cancelled in early 2024 when the notifications got overwhelming. The app was also difficult to use. Should have kept screenshots, since they charged me for an annual renewal anyway. I've cancelled AGAIN, which took about 6 times clicking cancel. Hopefully they actually cancel it this time and don't charge me again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Expensive unless you are fully committed. the trail period was not long enough for me determine if I'd really like it. I found it confusing at first and now I am realizing I won't use it enough to justify a $60/year subscription. And now, 2 years later they charged me with no notice and will not refund the fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app used to have a free option, and now I see you have to pay just to do the ""free trial"". Not cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping to get me organised with my habits and intentions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely Scam! This app is a joke! Does nothing for your ADHD or Procrastination like it claims. This app will charge you ¬£14.41 initially at the time of download and activation, but then will charge you again 2 weeks later another ¬£31.99 without your knowledge. And will continue taking payments if you do not check your bank account! Absolute scam! And I was going to ask for a refund of my original payment of ¬£14.41 because I was not satisfied with the app anyway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is just a miracle. I had struggles with keeping routine, but this app really helped me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Has no customisation to create my own habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No backup for free users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helping me begin good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The research and work behind the app is great to help you set habits and be consistent in the days you dont feel like it. My problem is the UI and user experience is confusing. After the initial journey was done it just ended and i did not know how to progress. I was about to delete the app until i started to look into the journeys and tried to edit my morning routine when i realised that there is a lot i did not know about. The app should guide the user more to retain and benefit them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is very good app and I like the most"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Acceptable but needs more options."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I wish the UI was more beginner friendly. I've downloaded the app twice but still disappointed with the experience. There's way too many complications and hurdles leading to dissatisfaction. The app has potential but it needs to be more simple."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another premium app ü•π"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I created this 5 star review 5 years ago, and revisiting the app it's improved all the more. I'm so fortunate to have this app. Edit: after another 3 years, I gotta say this is the best routine app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's only day one, but I'm hopeful about the progress I will make. The app is visually pleasing, interactive, and rewarding. I can tell its been well crafted by UX designers, marketers, and scientists to ensure your success."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it almost impossible to cancel and count on you forgetting that you have a subscription (a common problem for people with ADHD) in order to milk you for MONEY. it's a scam. Stay away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be very careful with this one - despite NOT selecting the box that would have confirmed I was happy with the terms of the subscription, I found I had 2 active subscriptions totalling about ¬£40 a month, one of which was over and beyond what I had any interest in participating in a trial for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Expensive and dishonest in its subscription management. I unsuscribed and they're atill charging me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is an app to take 19$ from your account I will have to change my card to avoid this mess.. Take CARE IT'S A SCAM, NO VLAUE AT ALL EVEN AFTER UNSUBSCRIBING :((( YOU MUST HAVE MADE MILLIONS FROM THE 10 M DOWNLOADS ¬°¬°¬°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started but I know I will get a better version of my self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm liking very much so far, small steps lead me closer to my goals and a successful routine!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its working well for me so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a fully paid one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"$40 a month. Ugh! üò£üò©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wasnt sure how I would like this app. But it is unlike any other. After my first two months, I'm going to have to figure out a payment plan so I can keep it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really motivated to get up and focus on my goals I don't know how but it makes me focus and complete my tasks everyday and also makes me ready for my upcoming day as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's helped me in so many ways!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Feels overly nurturing, 'soft', and cartoony. Too many silly e-certificates and acknowledgements. I find the app useful but don't enjoy engaging with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD I downloaded then canceled as the app as it was not for me pretty much straight away. Now, $69 has been taken from my account! I have proof of cancelation, which they refuse to acknowledge. This is theft and fraud, and I will be taking it further."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I don't know why people say this app is a scam. I've been using it for over 2 years and really enjoy the coaching voices and stories, the repeating habit lists, and ability to do challenges. There are some very confusing features (like the ""mountain"" journeys and the discussion forum that's not really a forum), but overall I enjoy the app and it's helped me build new habits. I do wish you could add weekly or monthly habits more easily. This year I will try live coaching. Anxiety kept me away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice aap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have requested for a refund on this app purchase as i don't need this app as the app has no access to my phone arrange for the refund @the earliest convenience as priority"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Complete scam. ""Free"" trial means $16. I have reciepts and proof. I want my money back and probably still report to the Better Business Bureau! I have sceenshots of this and never will try anything associated with this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am feeling good this is very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Otes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hey i contacted with you from the application but I will write here though The application doesn't show in Google subscription payment! I couldn't cancel the subscribe and you already took 1476 tl ƒ∞ want make a refund ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"YOU KEEP CHARGING ME BUT WON'T ACTIVATE IN MY ACCOUNT AND WON'T CANCEL OR RETURN ANY OF MY EMAILS! SCAMMERS!!!!!!!! UPDATE - THEY JUST SENT ME A CANNED REAPONSE TO CHECK THE HELP SECTION. AGAIN, NOT HELPFUL, AND NO ONE ON ONE ACTUAL HELP TO SOLVE MY ISSUE. GARBAGE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changed my Life for the better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is really good even without the premium. I'm sure its even better with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm in day 5. Most things I like. 2 things stand out that are upsetting me tho. 1st i am in a free trial phase and this morning I see a charge pending already and 2nd thing was I was asked a question about if I feel support is important, I said yes, then it wanted me to give information of someone to add to my support and wouldn't let me reject. I do not want to bring anyone with me on this app. it's my struggle, I want to fix myself alone, this problem/solution is within me alone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great habit healthy life builder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its really good and helps me with alot of things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app, i love it so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam you won't get a refund it's always the fine print don't trust"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Reposting this; be ashamed of yourselves. Taking away a discounted premium before I can try the free version, the guilt-tripping into purchasing premium by implying I'll only be happy/healthy if I spend money on this, and forcing me to explain why I'm saying no to setting up a goal. And I also just saw an ad on Facebook from you that said ""No wonder you're bedrotting."" Seriously; how DARE you, you shameful, moneyhungry ableists?! How on earth is this terrible excuse for an app rated so high?!?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app can be rather useful. The way they sneaked to get my money is not. We are talking about not having the option to stop your subscription from inside the app, not making it clear at all how to go on for cancelling it, and NOT SHOWING WHICH PLAN YOU ARE ON. In my case that led to thinking I had cancelled, while I didn't. Also, what is it with the glass of water. And with the too many features and options. And, support, don't reply to my message in your mechanistic wooden way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very beautiful and helpful app, it helps us to focus on everything like study, health, routine everything üíóüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm always skeptical of these kind of apps but this has definitely helped me with my self-confidence and habit structure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a 38 year old mom of 6 amazing kids I have high hopes for this app helping me seems like a great help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a simple way to be a better you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the science behind it, but if I don't complete every single task every single day it resets my streak, and I know that it's supposed to help with you completing every task, but to me it's a deterrent to me wanting to stick with it. I also think the single journey thing is a bit weird. So right now I'm on the morning and bedtime routine, and it wants me to exercise, well there's a live challenge available to stretch for 1 minute a day but I can't join it without stopping my current one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT put your credit card info unless you're sure you would like buy it. I did it for trial and got debited 100 dollars for some bs option I clicked, thanks to the confusing 100 add-on option list that pops up right after you add the payment method. When I asked for refund on customer support, they denied that trial money can't be reverted. PLEASE FIX THIS! UX or whatever, you guys are making a good app with a lot of science based porcesses that would actually work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous as it is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Powered by proven scientific research and AI, this feels very good so far. I love celebrating small wins and creating transformative habits one baby step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE. They double charged the membership by recharging the annual fee 2 months later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Unless you want a paid subscribtion, it's useless. The free version is little more than annoying advertisements for the paid subscription. It's like everything you click on is locked and it won't bother to tell you what is free version or not, so you waste a LOT of time trying to figure it out. I personally found it to be a source of stress in my life when it is SUPPOSED to be a resource to de-stress my life. Wish I never downloaded this frustration app. I'm uninstalling now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM WARNING! Fraudulent T's&C's & even when u cancel u still charged & they charge u double the stated amount...so tread wisely....these app scams are everywhere & even the banks, well my bank has stated that they have had the same call as me from many other customers....DO NOT GIVE THEM YOU CARD DETAILS!! Go pay for another game, not run by this group... I am but one of many who got suckered in, & no matter what you say, they just knuckle down & decline u & refuse to refund even though did it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have not used it for long but so far has been very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The help I didn't know I needed ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good I got some energy to do something happily I am still using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"$40 a year and they don't even have an android widget for routines. Put the routine right in front of my face instead of giving me 5000 annoying notifications that I'm going to ignore. Its a chore opening this app. Lost its focus a long time ago. Too many different things going on. Make it simple where it can be. Give me my widget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me be organised and healthy it a So provides ruotine thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun but methodical. I felt great about each step so far. No judgement when I missed a day. Only problem I had was I got sick just before exercises were added. Couldn't tell it that in anyway but returned after the time I was booked off for. While I didn't feel judged I did feel disappointed cause it was there as part of the routine and my streak was diminishing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT GET THIS APP. I canceled my free trial almost immediately, realizing the app wasn't what I expected, and I was charged at the end of the trial period anyway. After 2+ months of trying to get through to support for a refund, I was told I was ""ineligible."" I responded with screenshot evidence of my cancelation, but they seem unlikely to respond, given how difficult it has been to get a response so far. I wish I could give zero stars for their customer service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I have noticed, that they introduced new plan, which is more humane. The app is hardly usable, when entering, it has numerous popping up windows which is not possible to skip, t asks to go through all of the windows. While using the app during free trial, the same issue - spamming windows and cutscenes yake too much time. By subjective prception - more than a minute even whyle trying to fo even smallest intersctios"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Udate: I forgot i still have the app & had already a paid membership or subscription and accidentally paid for a 2 week trial of ¬£0.89p through facebook & need to cancel that, but I can't find it on my paypal nor the Fabulous website. I'm really confused & overwhelmed right now as I can't afford the monthly cost of ¬£46 or whatever it was. How do I fix this please?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have never used this app yet. I continue to get billed almost $30 a month. I can't seem to create an account until they bill me, and yet I've been billed already. Customer service sucks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't find this app at all useful and had tried a trial account. At which point I realized that somehow it had added me to two apps at once for a dollar or so but that the subscription to both would cost me over $100 a month. I looked over the app and found i had a lot little or no use for it. I unsubscribe, canceling my subscription but one or two months later now I've been charged for one of the apps and I was taken off the list immediately but there was no refund given.Not my favorite app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel this app helping me to build good habits every day I use it.... Truthfully I haven't been following it properly every day but in this life where we are lost in the dark and don't know where to go first, second or third, this app has me seeing a light at the end of the cave of chaos. I endorse this app.... Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No plan whatsoever after paying (!) for a trial. I hope support is responsive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The reminders and coaching content are fantastic I'd give it 5 stars but the dashboard is super-cluttered and the way it pushes the free companion apps is borderline spammy and detracts from the content. I'm giving it 4 stars though because the content really is quality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for helping me in the worst situation of my life, you were the light that shined"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just started using this app. It's already helping me out a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have gone back to this app three times now, and each time Fabulous helps coach me as I create positive changes in my life and daily routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is seriously excellent if you want to start good habits in your life... This is it... Just go with tha app do not hurry..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. Did a free trial in 2022, and cancelled a few days later because the app wasn't for me. Come to find out today, they never processed my cancellation, and billed me $40 a year for 3 years. I submitted proof of cancellation, and they ignored it, closed my ticket, and won't respond. If you get a ""free"" trial and decide it's not for you, go ahead and change your credit card number too. I had to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is such a great app! It makes building good habits super easy and fun. The design, the colours, animation used have a calming effect on the mind. Overall my experience has been a very pleasant & soothing !!! Thank u for designing such a kind self-help tool & a lovely app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to cancel. Please don't charge me for another month"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"we'll see if i improve, but overall the interface the graphics and everything from the introduction and all it is absolutely great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First they took , a long survey to select about personality after that 5 minutes heavy deatiled survey they ask to paid for using üòÇ really frustrating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed. This app has so much to teach and motivate me. To keep me on track. To help me create tiny habits that are small enough that it's easy to do them. I have gratitude for the Now, compassion for the Past and excitement for the Future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just doing a trial for now will rate in 2 weeks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is quite good and helpful I love using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Despite paying for the premium version, the app frequently downgrades to the free version, which is extremely frustrating. Customer support is unresponsive, leaving issues unresolved. Not sure if it's worth paying for premium if the service isn‚Äôt delivered as promised. This needs urgent attention."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app stole money from me twice (in 2023 and in 2024) even though I have all the evidence that I cancelled my subscription. Got into a 17 emails long thread with them and they still don't want to give my money back. I will file a report on Google Play and calling my bank and I will proceed with all the legal actions I can do to get my money back. PLEASE do not install this, this is a SCAM. Take care of urselves."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is really pretty, but the constant notifications get pretty annoying, pretty quickly. At the end I checked out of the app because it was getting on my nerves so badly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's very pretty but it's inflexible and formulaic...and weirdly condescending. Spent days ""learning"" things I've done for decades. Lots of ads for their other apps is annoying. Then they steal 45.99 from you every month until you block your credit card. BEWARE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is great can't wait until tomorrow so I can wake up and do it again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"u guys fre...?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app, can there be such an app created also for students particularly.. that'd really be helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app and mass of notifications gave me anxiety. I thought I canceled it, but I guess I didn't hit ""cancel"" enough times for them to accept it. I'm surprised to be charged for it weeks after thinking I canceled it and deleted the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app.It's so helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM SCAM SCAM. I cancelled this after reading they will keep charging after you cancel. This is what happened to me. I have screen shots of them confirming the cancellation and they have just taken another 25 quid payment. Should be banned from play stored and sued for fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's absolutely awful, as for someone with ADHD, I have been paying it for nothing for so long now. Did they make it intentionally so difficult to be cancelled?! It's not in my subscriptions, and keep forgetting to cancel, so they have been charging for nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just wish it wasn't so expensive $83 every 2 months is a bit steep for me but I'll complete the first 2 week trial. So far the set up seems manageable without being overwhelming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel stronger using the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing I like it ü´∂üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Updated review: I didn't stick with this app for longer than a couple of weeks, decided to delete it from my phone and then got charged an annual subscription fee a year after I had deleted the app. Reached out to the company to request a refund, and was told I'm not eligible under their terms and conditions. So user beware. Old review: Only been using for a week, but I LOVE the story based approach. I have ADHD and this app provides the dopamine hits I need to stick to my habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. The user experience is phenomenal It's been really helpful and is very enjoyable A lot of thought was put into it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I requested for a refund no responses yet, no real customer service.. no one replies from help centre"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible apps. Make it next to impossible to cancel subscription etc. also, paid and not sure 'what for' Avoid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is fun and insightful and keeps u on track while praising ur accomplishments. Daily accountability"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great for people with unmanaged lives and no healthy habits. From the beginning it feels like a get out of bed program. It's a lot if you're already functional. Hard to commit to if you're already busy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took money after I had cancelled my subscription. App doesn't work on my Google Pixel 8a (just hangs and then dies) Extremely unhappy [Edit] refunded my money now & cancelled subscription - I'll believe it when I see it. Be aware! If you sign up for more than just one service, it's a separate subscription that needs to be cancelled individually. You must cancel all subscriptions BEFORE closing your account, otherwise you'll keep paying them (which is terrible design!)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love itt"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammed me out of $65 with no consent. No refund. Avoid avoid avoid!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me really like this app, it displines me everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not friendly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Action does speak louder than words..Best App!‚≠ê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'd highly recommend this great application, if you are a really thoughtful person and want to achieve your goals and still lagging,,, this application is the best motivator for you.. ü©∂‚ú®üí´"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a good app to motivate one into becoming their better self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The words to describe this application would fall short. But honestly, you can see the effort put into creating the Wii system of routine classes and even the possibility of having a human coach!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really fabulous.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a stolen icon for this app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant whenever I plan to do something it reminded me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. The subscription did not appear in Google play subscription list, then Auto renewed for an entire year. I noticed this on my credit card 4 days later and was refused a refund. This app is absolutely not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Una muy buena aplicaci√≥n muy recomendada üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too high Pricing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app has nice visuals and it seems to be trying to do something good. But it is way too busy looking and confusing. I was excited to start but each time I opened the app I could not get a clear sense of what I was supposed to be doing. Three days in and I just had water when I woke up. If there is a good app in here it is buried behind a confusing structure and visual organization. I'd suggest they do less, clearly to start. As you get deeper into the app they can introduce all the things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've already cancelled the subscription, and they still charged me for no reason. This is a SCAM!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't cancel my subscription, I also tried to reach the support team but no one got back to me. If anyone from the fabulous team reads this reach to me so I can cancel my subscription. Also I think it would be much better if you guys had already added a cancel subscription option. That would have made a lot of people's life easier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Sucks that it's so expensive because I love this app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seems great for now and I love it ... I'm still in the free trial and will try my best to pay for at least 1year and see how much goals it can help me achieve."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No content. Just keeps asking for money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be mindful on this app Their fee trial still charges you even if you cancel their service regardless if you need it or not. I also noticed a pattern where they gives you fake deals and such to charge you even more than you supposed to. Never share your credit card information to them as there is no way in hell they will remove it either. I also strongly suggest to file to your respective cyber crime security in your country if you have been scammed too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app and I've been using it for about 2 years or so it keeps me on point while helping me to appreciate life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I have struggled creating & following through with habits, especially involving self care. Fabulous has been a complete game changer for me. I was hesitant at first, but after seeing how consistent I was becoming at changing my lifestyle, I tell everyone about this app & how great it is! With the guided skills building & other features, it's like having a personal life coach with you every day! If you're ready to make serious changes in your life, this app is for you!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM TRY FINCH INSTEAD ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is the most devious and dishonest app I've ever come across. They've ripped me off repeatedly, along with loads of other users. Keep well away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Run away from these scammers!! They stole my money!!! I saw their add on Pinterest and answered their online questionnaire about having a personalised daily plan during the free trial. I cancelled 24 hours after and guess what, I was charging the full amount. When I requested for a refund, I got a cold template referring me to the help centre. They are not in the business of helping people their just scammers and they don't deserve your money!Update:Still no refund!you scammers Refund me now!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helpfulness!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam they will keep charging your card different amounts even after you cancel the subscription they have broken links when trying to cancel and it's always a dead end road. They use Google to try to take money out too but when you go to Google subscriptions it isn't there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful in my success journey ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wouldn't have met this better to the best version of me if it's wasn't for this app. I've lost my phone, and it almost took me a year to restart. But here I am, and I have never felt better. Thank you, fabulous, I'm a college student now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good so far, but this is only the first day... maybe I should pop back after a few weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"PERFECTION IN DISGUISE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth the premium price, way too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"REPORT TO FTC & GOOGLE. They indirectly target a community known for forgetfulness. DECEPTION. Selling a subscription, no free trial. They hope you will forget a $40 FEE that you inadvertenly agreed to at trial. THIEFS! I never used the app. Ever. A reply is given to refund request that is COLD & ROBOTIC saying no refund, tho my charge is pending. I didnt cancel 24 hours before the charge. Never had a company deny a forgotten trial. Find another app for sure. UNETHICAL & UNMORAL."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't even keep the data of account anymore without premium which is ridiculous. This was good in it's release, now it is effective but not user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yay I drink water"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Whatever you do, do not pay for this app!! I canceled my subscription and was still charged. I canceled my card and somehow they got a hold of my new card number and they charged me. I have never had such a terrible experience with an app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam. Do not sign up for the free trial you will not be able to cancel and they will send an invalid charge when you begin. I was sent a charge of 67 as soon as the trial started which seemed fraudulent to my card company and was declined. Also, the button to 'continue' to cancel the free trial is disabled. Contacting them directly to cancel is ignored, so I had to cancel and reissue my card. Shame on Fabulous for taking advantage of people they claim to help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a Great application really"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous helps me make each day of my life count."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't do it. Even if you cancel the subscription it still charged me TWICE.... Then says they have no subscription linked to my email..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is excellent. The only change I would make is to extend benefits of free version of the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸäŸäŸÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best App ever!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They try set you up for a free trial and take your money. The prices are extortionate for the service they are providing. ¬£56 got taken away without my permission and can't even get a refund. I don't want to start on the customer support, because it's not even supportive. Wouldn't recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helped immensely but consistency is important for anything thinking this app will just fix your problems"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a subscription scam. Undeclared Set up fee, deceitful charges, difficult customer service. Avoid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the trial two weeks ago, received a confirmation that it had been cancelled, yet today I see a 800 SEK charge has been made to my bank account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still at the beginning of my journey, i can say the app makes the start interesting... looking forward to see the final result)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money stealing attempts made by fabulous application. I have cancelled it's subscription well before the trial end but still I am getting hit over my credit card for subscription money every day ,I also have asked to stop it but no solution till now provided by app developer. This is very shameful that people have invented new ways to steal money from subscribers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect for every lady"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice design people love it app not working not working"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a wonderful app, but can't afford it as a student. Surely I must say the Free trial was Amazing. Kudos to the App developer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I tried to cancel my subscription DAYS before it was going to be renewed, and they still took $40. Do NOT use this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best routine app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had cancelled the trial still they charged payment from my card they are frauds dont dowload this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"O k so y did I pay for subscription, if i have to pay for additional apps for things that are relative to my condition. I don't understand it. Why is this not included on your fabulous daily routine? Can you please explain to me why I have to pay for other apps? I'm talking about Adhd App and the sleep app and all the other apps. y isn't that not included in fabulous? I don't understand why do I have to pay even more money for more services?it's bad enough I can barely afford ur ap. I feel used"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Daily use aap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i don't like this app at all. you will get tired of entering the initial questions and also irritated of every seconds a question pop up. like what the hell , it's just a trash ...I'm logging out.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Loved using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Why Don't Turkish language"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stop asking"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me get a better sleep and a better morning routine I used to go or bed at 1am and wake up at 8:30am but now I go to bed at 11:11pm and wake up at 6am it has helped me is much and I hope it can help others too üòúüòù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app i have ever seen and used definitely prefer it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute faff trying to sign up. First paid for a two week free trial for it to be confirmed but then there is a week trial so paid for nothing and you go round in circles. Awful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome visuals and stpry telling. It's also quite motivating to make a change, or better yet, accomanies your goal of change in a nice way while guiding you through it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was charged for a premium membership even after cancelling during the trial period. Literally used this app for a day and found it quite questionable and time wasting. Even then, they decided to charge me after cancellation (which is an option they give themselves)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it seems like a nice way to keep on task"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun so far but it's pricey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please be careful. Like other users, I cancelled the premium subscription and tried to contact customer support to ask for a refund. No contact yet. Not interested once they get your money. Please please be warned."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am excited to try this app, so far it has the components i was looking for, so we will see if it works! :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good idea, bad execution. 1st, the app is overtly feminine. I like that asthetic, so it's ok- until you realize how predatory that is...then it just feels icky- especially since this app is built by men. Even after paying for the premium subscription there was SO MUCH advertising (for their other apps). People who want help with habits are probably distractable (me!!) so I found this very frustrating. No sick mode to pause/change journey. NO RESPONSE from ""support"" when I hit a glitch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is incredible. You won't regret when you install this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I found the user interface very busy and overwhelming. While the art and colors are interesting, there are lots of text/copy of varying size, positions and length indicating a requirement for dedicated focus to onboard, combined with music, sound effects, and popups. Fortunately they have settings for disabling sounds, music and vibration but the whole experience was too much for me, especially with no dark mode option."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Goog"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"the app is not bad, but the way the free trial period is handled, when you will be charged and when your last cancellation date is could be handled better. especially since the app is designed specifically for people who struggel with such things..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: I followed the websites recommendations and reinstalled the app. Still broken! I'm not interested in continuing. I'll find something less predatory and buggy. üëç I just paid for a subscription, opened the app and it's just a blank white screen and music. Great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app , to build habitsüòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"MASSIVE BUG: Long time fan, but with Alarm Heads active, it completely disables the bottom 15% of the phone screen, no taps/interaction registers at all. Had to Force Stop the app to regain use of the lower portion of my phone. Must fix immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2 months into it (of which 15 days I spend randomly exploring, not sticking to what the app asked me to do, etc.), I am seeing markedly visible changes - habits, mental health and cleanliness. I would only wish they had better support. I haven't received a response in 1.5 months on a support ticket."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an app like this for a long time and the interactive features and the sounds it has really keeps me engaged and wanting to open the app more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to structure things and get Great ways to do it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged my card after I cancelled , wont return my emails or money . Causer my car Insurance to bounce as money was taken without warning . Over 100 dollars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam. I paid the $1 for the whatever, I never signed up for any subscription and they charged me $54.99 through my paypal two weeks later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Eigentlich fand ich die App gar nicht so schlecht, bis sie mir pl√∂tzlich 50 Euro abgebucht haben und der Support mir jetzt einfach nicht antwortet. W√ºrde lieber 0/5 geben."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was amazing, I am all boosted up now!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazingly turning mundane things into fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel, charged me even though I canceled. Have wrote the company too but they still charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was wrongly charged ¬£57 after accepting a free trial and they refuse to refund me. Terrible service and horrible to not refund when not consented to. Contacted my bank to dispute but fabulous are unhelpful and fraudulent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am so glad yo have this app! my first mission seemed simple, however, it was something that I hadn't made into a habit. UNTIL NOW! I feel like the app is personalized to to fit me. It highlights my goals and is encouraging. Happy 5 year anniversary! I took a year off because of finances but im back!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very Bad services. First of all they make you buy trial subscription, which they say is free of cost, they get all the card details and even after cancelling trial subscription, they charged me the whole year amount and after this not letting me use the subscription services even. Worst platform ever and not even responding to mails.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app and I know I will make a change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nightmare. Do NOT do the free trial. It only lasts two weeks, and they will charge you over 40 dollars for a garbage app. There is no warning that the free trial is ending, either. In addition, it's difficult to end the subscription. The whole thing is so deceptive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had the app, I didn't use it at all, and one day, it charged me 40 euros. They haven't returned it since, and it has been weeks. I already sent multiple refund requests and I don't know what to do anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The daily routines really help me as I often forget what I'm doing and to care for myself , so these little notifications super help me to be the best version of me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I Cancelled this subscription two years ago. Emailed them last year when it renewed. They promised it was taken care of but never refunded me. Now i just received notice that ive renewed for another year!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I didn't even click on the activation link in my email and was charged $54.99. I tried to contact customer service, and it has been weeks and many emails, with no rectification. Not impressed. I have already provided all of the information requested multiple times, and I received one response, asking me to be patient for 7 business days, and it's been a month. I can see why you can't reply to all the refund requests, by the looks of all of the other reviews."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a horrible experience. They made it incredibly hard to cancel subscriptions, and they keep taking my money even though I had emailed them numerous times to cancel and refund! They made this for people with ADHD so they can take advantage of us. Disgusting experience üò§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worset app ever. Don‚Äôt give you the scope to explore without having premium membership. Why should someone bye premium membership without even exploring?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money stealing app, don't use it it's not worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to experience a productive routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Subscription Should be monthly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Habits leads to whatever you want to become.... Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very exciting and different app!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me stay on track! Unlike other apps, it has something irresistible that makes me want to return every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This helps me stray organized and helps me stray grounded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I WAS WRONGFULLY CHARGED. CANCEL THE PENDING INVOICES ASAP OR I'M SUING YOU TODAY! I've had enough with Fabulous. I have sent you guys too many tickets and emails already but nobody is responding. I was charged for something called Clarify, WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT and NEVER APPLIED FOR, and 4 goddamn private coachings, WHICH I NEVER APPLIED FOR EITHER. WHAT'S THIS??????? WHY DOESN'T ANYONE ANSWER??? I can't use my credit card because of your pending invoices. RETURN TO ME ASAFP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too greedy and dishonest, tries to keep you bound to subscription. Keeps giving you ads for their other apps. And for example with clarify (same provider) if you choose annual subscription with 'free' trial period, it is way more expensive than choosing a year subscription. So the trial is not free but you in fact pay more than 20eur for a week. The app has some good functions but it all seems so shallow when you get in the claws of their sales and marketing bogus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Read the 1 Star reviews. Or don't. If you do not read them? I believe you may very well regret it. Financially?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very good app to give a good daily routine for life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I recommend it to people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the poetry quotes in the daily reflections. Quality teaching, gamified üß©üéÆ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The fact this is a mental health app and when looking at prices it gives you a threat 'get the discount now or never' doesn't make people with mental health issues feel good. I think you need to think about where you want to help people or whether you want to stress people by panic buying. Appalling really."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Returned to this app after a long break and it had really gone downhill. The same old deceptive free trial sign up and multiple pricing plan traps you see on so many apps trying to convince you THIS TIME spending money will solve all your problems. High volume sounds on start up you can't mute or skip. Copy has taken on a condescending tone. Disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"complete scam. Cancel my free trial after a couple of days and still charged me. Sent 7 refund request haven't received a reply yet. People being having the same issues even 2 years back. Just Google these scammer. I sent 7 request through that link and have received zero replies. It's funny how you came and replied so fast here. Scammers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app mined my PayPal information through my Gmail and charged me for a subscription I did *not* consent to or sign up for. I had no idea they even had my PayPal info to charge me for anything. I'm waiting to hear back from support for a refund but I have no doubts they will give me a ridiculous run arpund based on how difficult they made it just to find out they had a payment method attached to my account and figure out how to cancel it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome! I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Already visited your useless site. I'm canceling this with my bank, reporting you to Google, to the Association for the Protection of the Rights of People with Disabilities, to T-Mobille. I'm making complaint against you EVERYWHE I can. Even if I have to do it on the news, where my family works. I told you, I never authorized the charge. I had to pay unbelievable money for dying person, replacing my devices. Whatever recurring BS you're talking about, all of my electronics BURNED. ALMOST"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's greatful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellence"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful app, can't wait to see how much I can achieve with this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tool for forming better habits! I use it all the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No no no!! They make it so difficult to cancel once the free trial has ended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have tried contacting customer service twice. First time was because the app wouldn't let me cancel my subscription. So I waited to hear back from someone and never got contacted. Now the app didn't charge me once but twice!!!! One for 29.99 and one for 39.99. This is absolutely ridiculous and need someone to contact me so I can get a refund!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not even worth one star. This company is predatory and evil, not to mention completely useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING: Be cautious when signing up for a 7-day trial with this company. I canceled my trial after finding the product unsatisfactory, but over a month later, I was still charged $39.99. When I log in, my account indicates I need to upgrade and offers another 7-day trial followed by the same $39.99 charge. Customer service refuses to issue refunds, responding with a generic message. After checking recent reviews, I discovered dozens of others reporting similar fraudulent charges."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do NOT use this. They will scam you and lie to you and steal your money. I signed up for the $10 trial and was also charged $67 on top of it. It's a total scam. I was denied a refund even though I was a victim of hidden charges and a bait and switch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I canceled my free trial but was still charged $39.90. When I kindly asked for a refund, I only got excuses instead of a resolution. I thought I was the only one, but then I saw other reviews with the same issue, and this unexpected charge left me very dissatisfied. The app design is ok, so I gave 3 stars instead of 1. Fix this, or many others won‚Äôt be as generous..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Literally fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful App, but like more info on how to use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Satisfied with our app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is it helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They wanted wayyyy too much money after 1 week. It's nice to have something trying to motivate you but it sucks when it feels paid for. IMHO"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Confusing and pointless. I was also signed up 2 different subscriptions and apps that I was unaware off"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm totally falling in love with this app,every single step I take is very appreciated. It motivates me to do so much more üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very confusing app. Too many different features and tasks to do. Confusing interface. It requires that you spend even more time on your screen. The ""free"" trial costed 1$ and obviously it's not about the money, it's about saying that it's for free. -Sure, the meaning of the word ""free"" might have changed from the last time I used it. I might need to be more careful when someone uses it and check all their policies first to understand what they mean"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great life app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I haven't used this app for such a long time, but for the little period I've seen evidence of drastic changes and improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It isn't free at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just for me üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used fabulous premium for a year, it was mediocre at best. It did not help add any new habit, but I enjoyed the nighttime audio affirmations, so I let it auto renew. BIG MISTAKE. After auto renewing (taking my money) it has never allowed me back into the premium version (can't hear the nighttime audio). I have been contacting customer support for over 3 months (they take 14 days to respond ""sorry we can't give you a refund and we are closing this ticket"") and still nothing. So calming lol üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They deduct money after cancelling subscription and no response to email so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Didn't use the app enough but now I can't find a way to easily cancel as the way through the app doesn't work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Decent app, but customer service is nonexistent. I upgraded and canceled within the window on Google Play but was still charged. I emailed with proof and followed up after being charged again but only received automated responses. It‚Äôs frustrating not to get clarity or assurance that I won‚Äôt be charged again. I just want to ensure they don‚Äôt take more of my money, but I‚Äôm not getting any resolution."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Basically the scammiest app I've ever seen. For clarity I have built subscription apps. I know when things are fair or not. For example it would just say during onboarding ""Hey do you want to tackle ADHD symptoms"" then if you click yes it silently subscribes you to another seperate service and you can't see the new sub in your fabulous account but will charge you 40 a month for this hidden service, even support won't easily find this new service and unsub you. The app isn't good anyway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app and has helped me in terms of my procrastation problem, the problem is the subscriptions, can you also make a monthly subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Oh my good again the same issue when already took subscription for a year why every month it istelling to upgrade fix it No response received why do I need to take pain when I paid in advance idont understand every month Same issue again and again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please be forewarned, they will charge you a year subscription if you share the guest passes. They say in an email and again in the app that you can give a guest pass someone for them to try out the app for free for 30 days. They don't say anywhere in the wording that they will charge you (not your friend) for a year subscription but they do. Update: I did reach out at the link you show for a refund and you haven't resolved it. Prove me wrong and answer my help submission with a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"RUN AWAY. The app required me to give my credit card, wouldn't let me cancel even after putting in a support ticket, then tried to bill me!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really confused me and stressed me out. Downloaded as it seemed targeted for someone like me- a neurodivergent person who struggles with daily life and routines. Feel like it's targeting this audience because it knows we are naive and eager to try things to better ourselves üòû feel daft for paying even the minimum amount thinking it might be helpful, but been left feeling overwhelmed and like I've been scammed.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thats very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very complex app, deleting it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very efficient and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate this app for all it has done for me and for what it's still doing for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Anytime an app ask for money b4 you can use it, it's not the 1"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too complicated interface. I uninstalled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best self help app.... Thanks guys this marks the turning point of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I start the 7 day trial, but it made me fill out the question as a new user each time I opened the app. Hopefully it does not try to charge me in 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall experience is quite good, but the UI could be simpler"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam/dishonest charging. Not happy that I have had large charges happen that I was not aware were coming. Installed just over a week ago and have had around $80 of charges where it does not tell you or require authorization to charge my account nor can I set a limit or see these charges on my Google Play history."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fyi, while there is a free trial, there is no free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't sign up. Claims a 5 star rating I'm the app store. At the time of writing it's 4.1. That is a lie."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DON'T DO IT!!! There is no free trial. They'll charge you even after you have canceled your subscription. I canceled it well before the month was up and just got charged twice from them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Even you paid for premium, you still got soft selling ads, and it is annoying. You intend to limit your phone usage, but if you were not cautious enough you will waste more time here."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am not a member! I've emailed and now (11/24- 4xs) Stop trying to charge my account, of course, it declined, I'm not a member!! Remove my email from whatever you had it on. I tried this thing. I didn't like it. Now this is the 4TH email of you guys trying to charge me, and of course question wasn't on your FAQ, and my prior message sounded like an automated message. That's enough ambiguity that I wouldn't want to work with your company. I've emailed them & filled out their BS. leave me ALONE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fake registration was done using my email address and Fabulous charged my card attached to Google pay even if I do not confirm the registration by mail. Once that trial period elapsed my bank account charged. I didn't even had the app installed. Big surprise when I was called by the bank about an awkward transaction. Fabulous never returned my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app I likethis app so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to have trial on this app unless you want to drink water only. I don't need app to drink water. Please let us have free full trial for maybe 5 days first. I am willing to pay but not willing to be forced to pay. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never download this app and pay. You can never find the unsubscribe button on the app. Even worse, I was still charged even after I managed to subscribe. There are so many similar and free apps. No reason to use this overpriced one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have long unsubscribed and uninstalled and come to find years later they are still charging me 40 euro. I demand a refund and apology."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liked it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It demands you money"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started this with no expectations and honestly didn't think I would last a day. I've been using it for about 6 months and it has helped me clear my head and put things into focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the subscription after the free trial but they still continued on attempting to charge my card. Ended up blocking their charges and deleting the account on The Fabulous. The charge attempts still occur every few days for the last couple of months, which is extremely annoying and should not be happening given the fact that the subscription was cancelled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very helping but it's a bit pricey I think. So if they could re arrange the prices it will be absolutely recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good to introduce new habits and create a successful routine. Highly customizable. I don't like all the different apps that are integrated - I would prefer if it was all in one platform. I have not used features, because it means installing another app. Overall, very good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app feels just right, I've tried many others and they weren't activate me in the way what really fits me. And this app just fits, easy to follow, easy interface so its not overwhelming me a soon I open the app. Love the journey and i feel grateful of finding this app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice Work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. It really helped keep me organized, focused and healthy. Now I remember why I deleted it and went searching for something similar. You can only add 2 tasks per routine unless you pay for a membership. I get they need money to fund the app but to take away features that were already free instead of making new ones for members is a great way to lose customers."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulous this is your last warning before legal action will be taken. My boyfriend has been waiting for 3 weeks now for his refund and you keep saying you have high volumes of emails. Please contact me asap!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm here to say that this app changed a significant part of my life for the better. This is not a normal application. This team has a genuine desire to improve peoples' lives. It is not profit-driven at all. The app is constantly improving and makes you feel GOOD when you don't follow through. One glass of water next to my bedstand became 1.5-3L/day. From the cleaning timers, daily coaching, various challenges, to the community. Thank you for everything you do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Misleading advertising. üí∏üí∏üí∏ :) bye"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not do the free trial. I went to cancel it and the webpage froze, not allowing me to cancel. I tried to do it on desktop and I had the same problem. I messaged support and they told me to go to the same webpage that doesn't work, so sending me in a loop. The best I could do was pause the subscription. I'm not able to get a hold of a real person who works for the company. I fear I may be stuck paying for this app I don't use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"40$ a month for an app to remind you to drink water and exercise, think positive Yeah you can take this app and shove it, you make it a ridiculous process just to unsubscribe from this tacky service"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I searched and used many cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) apps and this is my favorite. It's the perfect blend of information & inspiration; some apps are too dry, clinical, & complex, some are too fluffy and not as robust. Fabulous has all the important features like science based coaching, tracking, & feedback that is immersive & engaging with stunning graphics and sound bites. I personally love the stories, quotes, metaphors, and antidotes that make the lessons more relatable and memorable."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't help at all, cannot cancel and keeps taking money from bank SCAM"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed this based on an Instagram ad, they signed me up for a premium trial that would have charged me 39e if I didn't cancel within two weeks, I cancelled, and they have sent me at least a dozen spam emails trying to sign me back up. I haven't even used the app, and I won't because of that garbage spammy behaviour."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled this subscription but I got charged again today. How do I get out of this? I no longer want the app, how do I get my money back?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I keep coming back to this app. I really want to like it. But it always ends up overwhelming me. The number of pop-up ads for other apps from the same company. The interface feels messy or disorganized to me, like a bunch of things just plopped on a page. Also, it moves too quickly. I feel like I haven't really settled into a particular routine before another goal launches and then I just feel pressured. It's too much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam!!!! I canceled my subscription before the free trial ended, but they still charged me. I contacted support twice with no response. Avoid this app‚Äîit steals your money!!! Play Store should remove it immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute robbers that belong in jail. I never agreed to their subscription and they charged anyway"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful. Forces you to subscribe. Rather one off purchase. Scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Right now for me it has been a TOTAL SCAM. EVERY TIME I try to open the app I'm promoted to ""verify my email"" (done 5√ó) then take their quiz, then PAY -I PAID $1 for the TRIAL, but I have NO ACCESS. Such a waste of time, hope and of course $1"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The advice and aids are helping. I love this app. Get it and get more Zs. I'm getting more accomplished. I'm feeling less stree."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could give negative stars I would! DO NOT SHARE YOUR CARD INFO OR PAYPAL INFO. Even after you cancel your subscription they will continue to pull money out of WHATEVER ACCOUNT THEY CAN FIND. I've had a credit card paid off for 5 years (I keep it now for emergencies) and I have no idea how but they are now using that card to charge subscriptions to and are not helping to fix the problem. I was told 2 weeks ago my account was canceled and no longer set up on auto renewal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Having an absolute nightmare and just going round in circles. Cannot manage subscription. Will not let me log in to cancel, or rather logs me in then loops me back round to log in and won't let me into manage subscription.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Great concept but rarely recognizes my premium subscription so it's useless. Have asked several times for my money back. No reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A waste of time and money. I was curious about all the awards and interest this app has received, but I should have known since they wouldn't let me see the app without signing up that it was a farce.

Just too much for me.. kudos to the graphics people and story line. Boo to the rest, deleting the app now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the app hoping that it will help me boost my productivity. Instead I was charged three times with transactions I never knew was happening in my bank account. They charge me a total of $120.00 for no reason. This app is a scam."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I've used the app for more than a year. Purchased the Premium membership one year ago. It has provided many helpful, encouraging, self strengthening tips. Now, I'm going to cancel my subscription. I've spent 30 minutes trying to make that happen. Just know that if you pay for the subscription, this is one of those ""We are programmed to receive, but you can never leave"" services."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Free version literally has nothing, totally waste. And if u take free trial u can never cut it away according to other reviews. I just kept one task and timer it didn't even give a notification at that time. You cant put more than 2 tasks for free, ofcourse even 1 doesnt work. Deleting this waste."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too much advertising for other apps. A bit tooo annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If i could give zero stars I would!!! Firstly the app never functioned properly on my device, so I cancelled and deleted. It clearly shows I don't have an active subscription but yet you charged me! Refund my money!!! UPDATE: Ive had a so called agent tell me that you can't refund even though I cannot even use ur subscription. SHAME ON YOU, THIEVES!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"wouldnt let me refund after a week of purchasing something -- i mean seriously? 24 hours? For such a ludicrous price of 50+ dollars too. How are you gonna let someone submit a form to request a refund, ONLY to say they're not eligible to get one because you have to request a refund within 24 hours?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"At first I thought there weren't enough FABULOUS words to describe this app! I loved it!!! It got me to do what I wanted to do! I thought it would be absolutely amazing, wonderful and life changing, but it fell short when it was so rigid as to not allow marking tasks or habits done the following day. There's great science and research, but uaer execution in the app is lacking. Four stars is generous. Exerting I want to use the app again, it's less helpful, long set up and more cumbersome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It doesn't deserve one star. This app will continuously charge you after you cancel your membership. I had a free two week trial that I canceled within the first week I deleted the app and never used it again. Now months later I'm still getting charged for the premium membership. I had to block them through my bank. Getting ahold of customer service or support for this app is impossible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"14 days into my routine journey, this app is making a difference in the quality of my life, keeping me on track, and giving me guidance. I have ADHD like symptoms, even if in my days they didn't know anything about it. My brain is over active,I struggle with simplifying, prioritizing, and creating/maintaining routines. This app guides me through all these steps, explaining little things, in small steps that are not overwhelming; changing doesn't seem impossible anymore because I feel guided."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very friendly and motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying starting this journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Next payment 7 Nov 2025 but I updated fabulous and downgrade to the standard plan"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I didn't feel like the app did anything to change my habits or behavior. I didn't interact with the coaching much because I wasn't sure where to go. The overall UI is pretty cluttered. For an app that is supposed to make the habit building process highly accessible, I would've appreciated a concrete path to follow apart from the tasks. Also, you can't go back to the previous calendar day, so if you go to bed after 12AM... don't get the app. I'm uninstalling for that reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This really is a great app. I was surprised how much I liked it. Really nice daily coaching sessions, they don't take long to do. Great at slowly building routines and providing motivation. A lot to explore in the app. Worth the yearly cost. 100% recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good for helping establish routines, but can't enter missed data for past days and the constant ads for their other apps become annoying pretty quickly. Also, what happened to the adventure with the camel? It just stopped suddenly. I won't resubscribe at the end of my current term."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted a daily planner, not a therapeutic session that you are taking an incessant survey. Stupid app, different people have different priorities work as per their demand not your vision."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Although I don't have the full benefit of the app, what I do have access to makes me feel in control of my life and environment again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got refunded for Premium, don't give up. - Original comment: Frozen screen after a few clicks. I have not seen more of the app. I see other subscribing users have had the same issue. Mine is lasting for months but the developers claim the problem is solved. The settings I am asked to change by support does not show even after login. Waiting for help is too long but neither Google Play nor Fabulous takes the responsibility for refunds, therefore one star only."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an absolutely amazing app! Just one suggestion, maybe it should allow to revisit the daily coaching of the day before. Sometimes it so happens that you sleep only by 1 AM, but by then nightly coaching is gone to next day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helped me way more than I could have ever thought before installing this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app so much, I love the colors, the dynamics, the history everything is perfect, but because I get distracted easily I tend to forget to enter the app! If this is an app to help with ADHD I recommend that you should create widgets, it is much more easier to keep track of something you can see on your screen constantly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you are struggling, if you are in a dark place and can't climb out or are your own worst bully... Try this Yes it's a routine app and yes I need help working on my autopilot habits But it's helped in a lot more ways than that. Please try it if you're thinking about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Warning!!! Scam!! do not go for this app! I tried and got an email to activate the account but remember thinking it was really tricky. I then tried the app a few days and realized it wasn't for me, at least not right now and cancelled the subscription on Google play. Now I find out they have charged me around 52 ‚Ç¨ for another subscription, because apparently I have another subscription but not through my phone. I sent a request to get a refund but they won't.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the visual and music on the app. I have only started a couple of days and used the morning routine.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"In the busy race of life, it is easy to overlook treating yourself the way you deserve when you are always struggling with money, work, relationships and just trying to tread water. The Fabulous App has been a partner to me to make sure I am making steps to achieve my goals on a micro level. I use the app in tandem with affirmations, medication and other mental help resources. Fabulous keeps me accountable and on track on the journey to be a happier, better me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Allah connected me to this app and it was all i needed to lock on, So you can do better by adding normal calendar in it, and make it possible for people to type what they want to do on a particular day, so that people like me can plan ahead.."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Updated: Subscription issue was resolved. App is nice and positive, just not for me as some days the positivity felt almost aggressive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having a great experience so far. Feeling motivation without pressure, at the same time the desire for commitment. Following through, not cheating because it's made easy and still feeling like I've accomplished something."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was in the trial phase and was not enjoying the app at all. And later I realised that I forgot to cancel my subscription and you charged me for the whole year. I genuinely don't like the app app and it doesn't make any difference to my life. Please refund my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Still testing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't buy this app if something happens they don't have decency to reply you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good app, useful for creating habits. However rated 1 star as I have decided not to continue from trial (had for 3 days). Website unresponsive to cancellation request. App sending me round in circles and logging me out when I try to cancel. Support request raised and if money is taken I wont be impressed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"is it that hard to add Arabic language?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have accidentally subscribed to their service. however, I cancelled the subscription within an hour without even using the app. Today, I find out, They are still charging me. This scam service should not be subscribed by anyone. Whatever you do, Do not subscribe. They are running scams on Google play. Despite mailing them repeatedly for rectification they kept me unanswered, which proves their fraudulent practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Weird. The app doesn't allow me to access anything. They ask question and they ask to pay 16 euros per week. Yeah, but for what? I 1st must know how it works? Is that suits me, etc. Anyway. Uninstall ;)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app üòå‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit to add that my account was still charged after cancelling. Scam. Takes your CC info and sets you up with auto renewing subscriptions that are near impossible to cancel. You don't even have a way to manage your account on the app and no link to where it can be managed on the web. Then when I finally found it, I had to submit a written request to cancel the subscription that I never signed up for! I will be filing a dispute with my bank."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"While the app was great, I cancelled my subscription over a year ago and keep getting charged $40 every 6 months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam they want money for everything they won't cancel your subscription even if you go through the steps of going to there website logging into it and having to find the place you cancel them at and then still try and charge you every month do not waist your time or money on it I had to get a new bank plus side I'm not on one of those stupid online banks now so I guess thinks for the push would give less than one star if I could stop preying on people trying to make there life better"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Expensive as phone recharge not for students"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"edit: absolute scam. You can cancel it through the chatbot 345 times, you can record your screen while you do it... They won't cancel. They'll say you chose a promotion. Report to FTC. Report every additional charge. They're already working on class action lawsuits with this company. Be smarter than I am, don't do it. Don't give your card or banking information for a false score.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app THREE years ago and then canceled my subscription. These jokers just charged me 39.99, did NOT send a receipt, did not charge it through the Google Play Store. I happened to spot it in my banking app as ""Fabulous App Paris"", along with a 0.40 international transaction fee. CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS because these freaks may be charging people without permission and not telling you. Absolutely sick."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Note to anyone having trouble cancelling/getting a refund. Don't bother trying to reason with customer service, and don't trust them when they say they've canceled your subscription. Dispute it directly with PayPal or your bank and remove that payment method from your account (you can do it directly from PayPal). I got refunds for the ""free trial"" and second autopay within minutes because PayPal could tell it was a scam."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Build right up to Atomic Habits by James Clear; the same philosophies."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam scam scam. I signed up for the free trial then when I tried to cancel. You get a bott that says its cancelled then you still get charged. Very convoluted process designed to scam people. Also, I don't even have an account the cancel. Also tries to get you to sign up to 10 different subscriptions in the process Edit - after your response I have screenshot where your online chat says it has been cancelled yet you still charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was hesitant at first cuz I REALLY STRUGGLE with staying on track with trying to better myself by changing to better habits and such, but I am absolutely loving this Fabulous app!! It is personalized, tailor to me exactly. I already am seeing results and feeling better, confidence is key for me. Forever grateful!! Also, they offered me a really good deal on the Premium version so that's the one I've been using. I couldn't recommend this more! Thanks to all at Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's basically your personal digital life trainer. It's reasonably priced for what you get. I purchase yearly memberships. What I find is it's genuinely supportive. Some of it is cheesy, but it makes me feel good and encouraged instead of cringing. I highly recommend if you need consistency in your life. I have genuinely started having a happier life because of the support this app gives me. (I have been using this app on and off for over 2 years)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very structured and simple, but deep. It is engaging because it hits certain task oriented things that you CAN do. Small, not asking for too much. Great for for the long run overall. It's great. I wanted to add a note... This is still awesome but I did switch to Clarify ADHD . Gives me the same structure but tuned to ADHD specifically. Thank you fabulous! You guys rock. (Clarify ADHD is a resource offered by fabulous but a separate charge if you go premium.) Thanks fab family!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've already canceled this subscription, why am I still being debited? It's been 2months and I've never used this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice interesting concept and design"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Works good leaving 4* to see if it will actually help me stick to it. This is posted day one of having it. I'll update in about a week if I stick to it. (Week 1 1/2 had exams and was too busy to update, worked somewhat well under stress testing but the adding stuff to the list wasn't exactly helpful)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful as it organizes your day and makes you productive.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Steals your money even if you cancelled days before your free trial is over and won't refund money. Says you are ineligible and then stops replying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Will fraudulently take your money even if you have cancelled your account well before the date. When you request a refund they will say its your fault and refuse! Do NOT recommend this app or any affiliated with this company!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE APP. It's a scam and they have horrible customer service. I had a bug trying to cancel membership. They took over $100 out of my account and then when I contacted customer service for a refund they will not respond it's been 2 weeks!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I started to pay for the subscription and found different charges that didn't make sense. I cancelled everything (about $40) and still got charged $104.99... I can't afford to be ripped off like this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed, paid 1 Euro, could not run app. Even for the trial. Cancelled a few minutes after. Stiil didn't refund me. Just an automated reply that trial is not refundable. Today they charged me the full amount. Not happy! Update... PayPal refunded me the premium, still waiting for the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app. I signed up for the free trial and quickly realized it wasn't useful to me. This is fine, it happens, and it should not reflect negatively on the service. 14 days later, however, I was still charged for a full month while still having a canceled account. I've submitted 2 refund requests and have yet to hear back in the slightest. I have a feeling I'll never get that money back. If I do, I'll amend this review. Do not download this app. Find a different daily routine app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You're the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The coaching sessions have stopped working for me and their support does absolutely nothing. They don't email you or follow through"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the way how it starts with a small step which eventually helps to make it a habit or in other words I like how this app take human psychology into account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash application, wasting time and money both."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wow. This was an obnoxious waste of time. From the moment it opened with annoyingly tinkly 'music' to the badly worded either-or questions of a student project. You ask what time I wake up as if I even have that consistent. You ask if i like jumping to conclusions rather than thinking about it as if it's a choice. Also, a 7 day trial when I'm going to forget it exists after one day isn't useful. Another supposed ADHD app for which I'm too ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app super grateful for this... I'm really very thankful for helping me become a better person"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam of an app. Charges you 32 pound after the first month and sets automatic payments to your PayPal account. Do not download."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it. Really helpful and easy to apply"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it it's very inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I've been looking for an app like this. An all in one app, that will boost my focus and productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I find it very motivating and in no way judgemental which does a lot for me to stay motivated. Currently doing the free trial and if I could afford it, it would definitely be something I'd invest in for myself. It's really helping me keep on track with my goals. It would help if there was a personalization where you could add that you're a parent and tips on how to navigate daily life, find time for self when you have a little one to care for, and of course goals, etc. to match."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I finally got my refunds. I signed up for trial for dollar, then cancelled almost immediately. Fabulous then charged me two separate charges, one 29.99 and one 39.99, on Oct 2. And I haven't been refunded yet, despite numerous emails. I'd say that's pretty shady behavior. Edited to clarify: I submitted the refund request. I'm still waiting. I've sent follow up emails. Nice to know that the company can just ignore refund requests."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome App. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me alot in my poor planning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm getting ripped off! Paid $29.99 subscription that's for 3 months. I haven't had access since October 11! Just sent an email with the invoice. Will I get ignored again?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its amazing app but sadly it's with payment what ppl who got no money will do?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So they just charged me for a $39.99 subscription without me ever signing up. This app is predatory to select populations of its users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good, keeps me wanting to do better. Good systems to keep you engaged, lots of resources for anything you ought need to achieve basic goals and habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Can't go wrong with trying them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible company because if you email them about a bug or wanting a refund, they just ignore you (apparently they will comment on reviews though)! I'm literally paying for this app, but not able to use it and can't get my money back. So frustrating! I have gone to help.thefabulous.co and have had no help. Still waiting on a reply (from well over a week ago)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Beautiful idea to build habits slow and steady, amazing work to create a visual appeal. BUT, it gives me one option to start my habits: 3 days of drinking a glass of water first thing in the mrnng. Which I already do for years now. The second step in three days - get a nourishing breakfast for three days. Which I won't do because my routine is to have intermittent fasting until 2pm. I do not know what is going next, but my trial period is 7 days. Lack of flexibility might be a deal breaker."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to give the app a shot, so I entered the free trial. I was incorrectly charged (I cancelled early so I wouldn't forget) and haven't heard back from support. Their emails says they get back to you in 4 business days but it's been almost two weeks. Even worse, I was charged and don't even have access to the premium version of the app. If the team for the app behave like this, I suggest you not give them your credit card. Edit - I did contact support through the help site listed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam to steal your money with no way to cancel. Beware. Do not even download this one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is just a-ma-zing ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Skipped registering bc I dont want to give random apps my email when I dont even know if I like it yet. Despite this, it asks for my email again later when I still haven't even gotten to see the meat of this thing. Based on other's reviews on the trial thing as well, this seems lowk predatory"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps keep myself on track with teaching me how to be kind to myself and the guidance to a new way to gently get started in my Fabulous new journey ‚ú®Ô∏è in a new life of self love, self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I received no notice that I would be charged post trial period and customer service offered no resolution. I would not trust this app for future use. The app is crowded with offers for you to buy more services."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is too expensive for me. The app suddenly charged my credit card without my permission. I only agreed to a $1 trial, but then $39.99 was taken. Please refund the amount!! You could say: This app is making it very difficult to unsubscribe, the process feels overly complicated and tricky."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply perfect! This has been helping me be organised for quite a while now and I must say I'm impressed. I'm really satisfied with my progress and I'm determined to keep going! The best part is the daily coaching. Super motivational and helpful! Thanks again, Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. Its really helpful. I recommend this to anyone that want to inprove their personal life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me so much by giving me the feeling of accomplishment thru small tasks and words of affirmation. It truly is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like how this app doesn't make you feel forced into major changes immediately. You start with something small, like drinking water and work your way through other steps, slowly adding more. It's affordable, has no pressure, and is customizable for each person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Over zealous AI BS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is great but it lacks transparency. It directs you to a 3rd-party website for free subscription but no any subscription record listed in the Play Store. Until noticed my card being charged varying amounts on different days of the month, I asked for a refund, but their support refused n wasn't helpful at all. I ended up being charged over a Rm1000, which is quite steep given the local cost of living in Malaysia. I feel that their approach is deceptive n dishonet.üëéüèºüëéüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Feeling very positive about this app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't give the app a chance I just saw a non-binary and I uninstalled it immediately, if they are supporting crazy people I don't want to use the product"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I tried the app but it wasn't for me, so I deleted my account. However, after the trial period ended, I was still billed 39.99 Euro. The subscription doesn't even show up at the Playstore, my Google account or PayPal and you don't get any information about the subscription via email. Update: The support team reacted quickly and I received a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam. I see the Instagram ad and I arrive here. But the entire service is a trash. The best option for any user is safeguard your money of this scammers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So amazing in helping me build my habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app helps you improve your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged Even After Same-Day Cancellation on Free Trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just give it a try small bricks built all the castles üß± üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app seems amazing but you can not do anything without paying why make a app if you can't do anything?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started and I feel amazing. This app has done wonders and I have absolutely no reason to stop now. It's a shame this isn't 100% free but whatever. The options you get for free are plenty if you ask me. I would definitely recommend this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid for a premium 2 week trial and the app freezes after taking me to the first step. Can you help fix the app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I just started and its good already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was okay, but now I'm updating my review to complain about them taking my debit card and money for a membership/subscription I cancelled a week ago! üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Don't bother wasting your time after skipping a million different offers. You get to a main screen and nothing works. I've uninstalled closed the app. I've spent 30 mins just trying to get it work. I cancelled straight away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only been using this for 2wks so far & I've already noticed a major improvement in how positive I feel about what I'm able to accomplish in a day. My favourite part is the daily coaching- so many insightful gems! Love the app interface too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful with the app, if once you did any transaction for premium, pls disable transaction via bank apps, because this app charge very high and it will automatically deduct."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst customer service experience. They take a very long time to get back to you. It's been over a month, and I have not yet received a refund for 2 large payments they took from my account! It is extremely frustrating and would definitely not be recommending."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It helps me to understand myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Take a mini survey than it ask for a payment for your plan!!!!! Don't know if it's a 1 time payment or a monthly payment....just a another MONEY HUNGRY poeple!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"While the app may be helpful for those that find the need. Their customer service is absolutely terrible. They scam you on the cost of the app, telling you it's $1 to try and then they charge you for the whole year. They're AWFUL!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THIS IS A SCAM, THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY. I paid for a trial. Then got charged a $39.99 an annual subscription. After I reached out to cancel, I was told my subscription was canceled and I wouldn't get charged again after my ANNUAL subscription ended. Nope, I got charged the $39.99 annual fee AGAIN the next month. That's $80!!I've been emailing customer service for weeks now with NO RESPONSE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. IT IS A SCAM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It a helpful app app but but when you have the alarm on and the alarm goes off there doesn't seem to be a way to dismiss it from ringing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulously designed for fabulous subscription first even before exploring and then the access to its features whether it meets your fabulous requirements or not. Seriously it's Fabulous!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wasn't aware that I was subscribing to NOT one, but 2 applications for a total of $70 a Month!!! This is a total rip-off! Once I contacted customer service explained my mistake and also described the fact that my area was largely impacted by Helene... I hardly used the ONE application I installed, and, due to me NOT being aware of the second application, I'd never installed it! I wasn't granted back not even a partial refund! Keep my money a buy yourselves some decency! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please return my money you keep taking even after cancelling the subscription I don't like it, stop stealing people's money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most comprehensive and best app I've ever found to help me build real permanent change in my life. And it's all rooted in science."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"WOW that's awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried to charge me after I cancelled. I used the app for all of 30 minutes and decided it wasn't for me. A month ago."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They deducted 50$ from my account when I subscribed for a FREE TRIAL and instead gave me some 8 week personalised plan which I never activated since I didn't wanted it in first place. i tried contacting them but it's been 21+ days yet they are not replying at all. Absolutely scam app! COMPLETELY SCAM! !!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the app but i found it not suitable for me. I cancelled the plan but the app still charged me days after. Looking for my refund! This is unacceptable !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Honestly it's a confusing app, it doesn't feel as guided as I would like, in fact it feels kinda useless. For example I did a 'five day healthy eating challenge' but it just meant that for five days I could check a box saying I'm doing it... same with my morning and evening routines, I'm just opening an app to check the box... and there are other apps (Finch especially) that do this really well, with helpful notifications etc. Fabulous feels like a picture book, very bloated but it feels empty"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is just the best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a great experience..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm amazed at the moment I realized this app is actually helpful and good not just me .‚úì But @everyone you'll enjoy this app and its designed only to help you üôè legit thats it thank you app developer's and rest of ur team Truly from a adult females with ADHD FAS etc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"FREE TRIAL NOT FREE - There is a hidden ""set-up charge"". This app is a scam. Also they will sign you up to different sub-apps which each cost as much as ¬£31.99 month. When they have taken your money they will refuse to refund it or ignore your requests. I am not the only person this has happened to. Search online platforms like Reddit and there are many angry victims of this fraud. Particularly disappointing is the fact that this app targets those who struggle with organisation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love fabulous. I used it the first time years ago, now I'm back to it. It's a healthy habit tracker and life coaching that makes a huge difference in how I manage both my ADHD and autism. Don't be afraid to take it very slowly. It's about foundation building. The one bad thing about this product is that I can't use it on both my ipad and my and Android devices. Is there a way to synchronize them across both platforms?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this helping keep me on a routine!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As someone with adhd, I've never seen an app that's actually able to keep me on track with habit building, but this one is amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Incredibly confusing. Too many features and I'm constantly being directed to download their partner apps. The morning and evening routines only allow you to see one task at a time. The graphics are amazing and I really liked the daily motivational audio. Overall, there wasn't enough usable features for me to want to keep it. A note on the reviews that say this is difficult to cancel - I had to do it through the website of the app, not just on play store. I found this easy enough to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When you subscribe they take you to a different page. Then the subscription won't show in the Play store list, I just noticed today that I was charged and didn't have the app anymore. Feels like a scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible!!!! It's right against productivity!!!! It makes you lose a lot of time just setting things up and you cannot change anything unless you pay ...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, it seems like it's anticipating what my mind needs. And the coaching session content is very high quality and original"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is designed so well to help you make positive changes in your life. Taking small steps as well as growing a positive and resilient mindset are key in this journey. The access to coaching and daily encouragement are also an awesome aspect of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Jammed. Can't start my journey. Tapping on An Unexpected Journey for two days and nothing happens"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged me the full price even though i had cancelled before the trial period ended. I've tried to contact the customer service to no avail.. it's basically non-existent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is little help, and even when you cancel your subscription in time they will charge you. There are so many hidden charges, and all the advice was have a glass of water in the morning. Then they charged me ¬£70, and their attitude when complaining was - deal with it. Do not risk downloading. Edited to add: I have shown them the proof that it was cancelled on time, and now am just being ignored."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a wonderful tool to stay inspired and to make creative change in your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Something to try and hopefully see something. Will get back to you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Guys ... BEWARE! Be careful with the subscription strategy of this app. If you want to cancel the subscription later, they have made it hell difficult so that you will loose your money anyway. You cannot cancel the subscription in app. They will ask you to go web account. Web account will not create succesfully although you are using the app. Terrible!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This application is an absolute scam. I have requested that my subscription be cancelled on the same day I signed up for the trial. They just billed 2 transactions for 557.99ZAR and 764.99ZAR without permission. They don't respond except for saying the contact centre is currently busy. This is unacceptable and Google should seriously look into this dev's business practices. I have not received my Money back after multiple requests!!! Google, please take note!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Needs alot of money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just so beautiful, full of joy and interesting features, calm and motivating app. Truly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I didn't get a wake up call this morning to drink water üòí."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5. I loved you as the ocean loves the shore. Always searching for the home it can barely touch, even with all the power of the moon. I loved you as eternity, stretching into a forever I will not live to see. I loved you like regret, always there but never good enough. And I lost you like death carved you out of my soul. Now I'm just empty...and the end calls me home. üñ§ Artist | Unknown"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good plans"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I quite like the morning routine set up. The payment subscriptions are dodgy. Bombarded with offers to subscribe initially. A cheaper deal was offered and accepted but never applied and then a full ¬£34.99 taken without warning and the subscription is not within play store?? I emailed well before end of free trial to query what happened to the special offer, replied to say they're really busy and then nothing. But took full payment. Endless ads too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So adorable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app takes the overwhelm and daunting out of self improvement and goal setting. I'm able and supported to make steady progress, have compassion and move forward when I miss and slowly add more goals that are relative to what I'm going through and want to work towards."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"No puedo cancelar mi suscripci√≥n desde playstore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"seem to enjoy it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overwhelmingly annoyed at all the upgrade pop ups... like, do you truly understand ADHD? Also, it's like an act of congress to cancel bc it's not showing up in Google play subscriptions so I can cancel it. So, this is now 22 days later...I repeatedly asked for a refund... have heard ZERO back from you. Now I've flagged your app. Not good business practices, not impressed. I want my money back, I'm tired of the run around. Guys, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! ITS AWFUL!! SCAM!!! Contacting BBB!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app but most of the things is behind a pay wall, but you don't need worry about it that much it still provides the essence, even if not all of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞ Only problem here is subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They took my card info for the free trial but it is somehow not linked to my email so I cannot manually cancel and despite reaching out to tech support a week ago to fix the issue before the paid subscription went through I was just charged twice totalling to $70. Would not recommend anyone to even trial as bugs in the app would not let me register and it kept giving me the same set of questions to answer over and over, while never even getting to trial the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I look forward to using it to start my day off right. It helps me stay on top of my goals and reminds me to work on myself every day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Let's get deeper.. I'll review"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best routine tracker app for all neurospicy folks out there, in the the professional world and elsewhere. The more I use these apps the more tangible results I see materializing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Best App I Have ever Had In My Phone This Is therapeutic , amazing , authentic Life Changing You will never Regret having This"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Very annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wish I had read the reviews before getting the trial. I've messaged support re: a suicide trigger on the landing page, & within 36 hours it disappeared. So they read my suggestion & changed the app. Now, when i, or anyone else, try to cancel the subscription or even request a refund because of the HORRIBLE STORY ABOUT KILLING PUPPIES hit the app 1 day after I'm charged $40 for 2 months, (but could have got a year for $40) I see their response is ""we're delayed but we'll get to you soon"" WOW. :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not great for adhd-ers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am having a frustrating experience with this app. I wanted to cancel my subscription last year, but there was no straightforward way to unsubscribe through the app or their site. I reached out to their customer support via email and also help center , requesting to cancel my subscription. This lack of customer support and transparency around unsubscribing is very disappointing. Update: They charged again may account, although i write them many times to unsubscribe."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing Fabulous here ü§£ Wish I could give NO stars . RUN from this app fast !!could never install the trial or register, but they took my 54 $ the following month . it just kept freezing. emailing them is useless. PayPal denied my refund bc they sent them a tracking #? it's an online app there's nothing delivered ! Will be calling my card & PayPal Monday . I work too hard for my $$ for ppl like this to steal it !! PP needs to see all the horrible reviews here too!! Huge SCAM!! BEWARE üö´"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just wanted to explore with a free trial; I made a donation and tried it for what I thought was the full trial period. Then, before I expected, I was charged $30 and then another $40 for reasons unknown. I was notified by my credit card that the payment went through and i reviewed my notifications--and confirmed i was not notified that i'd be billed. I immediately cancelled and submitted a ""contact us"" form requesting my money be refunded. It's been weeks and I have not got it resolved. 0/5."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It feels like is actually cares about you and motivates you good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Keeping aside that it is of premium....this app is very impressive and useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful app for people who wants to be productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I need someone from customer service to get back to me asap. I've tried emailing, but got no response. I adore the app, but am having trouble with billing and need some help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription weeks ago before it renewed and you've been constantly attempting to charge my card. I have written to support since you don't have a number I can call and I don't get any response. Can you kindly let me know how to solve this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"somewhat helpful but bewarned, they are shady enough to not let you cancel your trial or membership in the App!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very slow to load and the routine instructions could be more clear and simple but apart from that I'm starting to take my life back step by step day by day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel novel about it and I'm doing my best to follow the manual you guys provide for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just click your ads a give you 1 star, because your ads are annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I work the night shift at my hospital and one thing I wish is that I could access the focus coaching it at different times of day. When I wake up in the afternoon, it's too late for the morning coaching for that day and too early for the next days coaching. When I can never access the coaching for the right time of day for me, it makes it harder to stick to my routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app honestly has been amazing, I still struggle but it has changed my life. This sounds dramatic but honestly it has changed my approach to things. I suffer with depression and because of this app I break every task in to the smallest goals and give myself more time to do them. I have approached every aspect of my life with this and I am doing so much better. My house is cleaner, I am taking care of myself and I am being so much more productive. Thank you so much to the creators!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it helps me to be always alert"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Is Not free app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps reminding me and bringing me to focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is more of cry for help than a review. I'm sure the app is good. But because I couldn't afford it I cancelled the subscription. But today I got the notification that my account is drained. I know it's only 29 dollars but it's a huge sum when it's converted to UAE AED. PLEASE HELP Update : they've told me that they'll refund but we'll see when I get the money back. Seems like a nice bunch of people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is real. full of substance. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. The custome service is not reaponding, the website is so bugged that it does not allow to cancel the trial membership in time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have no words thanks only thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its going great Most of the options require payments which isn't really possible for many people. I hope some of the options become unlocked without payments too. But otherwise its great!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bom"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it, it's very effective and got me a habit of excersing and drinking more water. I do wish I could add more habits, but the price is way too expensive for me. It's still helpful for me tho, so 5 stars üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged me multiple times in one month and refuse to respond to my inquires about canceling and refunding me. They are liars and theives. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. The response to this is more BS and they are still not responding. Save yourself frustration and $70, yes, they charged me $70 for one month and they just send emails telling me to reach out, but when I do, they tell me the issue is resolved. Lies... they have not ever responded with a substantive reply. Please save yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"""great app"" where you can only cancel your subscription on the website, but not in the app itself, since the payment is not made through Google, but directly to the developers. Know this when you deposit a dollar for a trial subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do NOT sign up for this app! I signed up for the 30 day trial and they took my last bit of cash out without warning. They stole ¬£34.99 despite there being NO subscription on my Google play or any other account or website. There was no warning or notification from them they just took it. Not a way to keep customers, Fabulous. Be more transparent. Thankfully my bank alerted me to this as a fraud so hopefully I can get it back. Otherwise I will be complaining to Fabulous until I do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"found that the tasks were not beneficial. Outside of this I faced many issues. 1.The pricing is way too high. 2.feels impossible to cancel my subscription. I have tried twice and have still been charged monthly(23 pounds a month,all that i have in my account as an 18 year old) 3.Add to point 2, as an app for people with ADHD, the difficulty with cancelling is particularly prominent due to how difficult it is to talk to any human being, automated response after automated respose,very unhappy:("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had paid for yearly subscription and yet am regularly asked for renewal after 7 day trial period. Fearing more amount will be auto Deducted, I cancelled my payment. Now am back to free plan. I had raised a ticket too and there has been no response. I had sought help in Help link and also messaged them at help.fabulous.co as mentioned by them and they didn't care to respond back yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just started using this app. So far it's easy to maneuver but it charges for the premium features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way too demanding in terms of interactions and notifications. The graphics are too much too. There is a whole animation just so you can tick a box that you drink a glass of water. The plans are also very confusing and to cancel they make you go on their website and have a deceiving process with ""delete my account"" written in very small at the bottom of a page after you thought you already done it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This looks like an app that is built to help people going through hard times scale through. Why make it a paid app. Even if you want to let people be atleast able to pay monthly. Don't shove yearly down their throats"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It all makes perfect sense. If you want to change your life, you start with the easiest first step, so you're sure not to fail. Then, each day, add one more step that is also easy to accomplish. You build and buildThe coach's voice is gentle yet uses the perfect amount of urgency in each word to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. Then I listen to it again to make sure I didn't miss anything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a fraud app i cancel my subscription before 7 days it still deduct money from my acc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I usually don't leave comments on apps, but this was such a bad experience that I had to. This app uses behavioral science to charge accordingly to your urge to use the app. I find this discrimiatory, especially because if you are in a hurry, you dont realize that is possible to have a free trial. I paid for the trial, and later that day, when I opened it from my tablet, I realized it was not necessary. I did not like the app in overall, and I would have prefer not to pay to find that out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm traumatized by the experience. I was given a choice to pick the price for the trial period, and picked the smallest amount but was charged the biggest. Support refused to refund, and I don't even feel like trying the app any longer. The first thing it offered to me is to drink water every day, which I already have as a habit, and I cannot even delete it. Devastating app and disappointing approach to the client in all means."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good and effective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It helps me to methodically take small self care steps. The affirmations that are included are very helpful for getting into a better mindset."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a subscription service. Deceptive Advertising. Shouldn't be wasting people time by not being upfront about the cost."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app, however, the interface is a bit too much. I prefer cleaner less colors and pictures. It helps me to focus better. I find myself getting distracted easily with all that is going on with the layout and interface. But I do enjoy and like the daily prompts for the activities I choose to wake up with. The exercises are great and love those!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App to remind you to do things... maybe it should remind you that it will be taking your money today. $40 is beyond ridiculous for what is offered"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It takes lil steps that make a big difference!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After bungles with sorting out a ""bad"" subscription being cancelled, I've had the app with a working subscription for nearly a month now and I've had 3 glasses of water that I may not have otherwise had... It looked cool in the ad, but practically, üòí ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pretty underwhelming.. It's just an over glorified ""to do"" list I could make myself for FREE.. Also, the app *assumes* too much about the user, like- that saving money is a CHOICE for everyone. üò≥Not everyone has a *savable* INCOME."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A drop of constructive calmness in our world full of dispear waves üëã ‚ú®Ô∏è üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just love it. My favorite app to became fabulous üëå. It works if you do your part üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is not made clear that the ""personal coaching"" service is separate from the rest of the app itself. It's my fault for not noticing that I was still being charged, though. BEWARE -- If you try this and don't end up using it, there are TWO charges you must cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good very good should try this but little like confusing but very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Rewarding xxx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled as soon as it refused to move forward without me submitting my email. It could have saved me 5 min if it had said so from the start"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes goals appear smaller and achievable. The poetry in the stories makes for great affirmations and spells."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am resurrected! üåû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Fabulous app really helps motivate and helps me stay on track!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I've used this app on and off for years. Loved it at first. It's buggy, but I got enough benefit that I didn't mind. Eventually the cons outweighed the pros. They created more apps and push them in your face from within this app so it all just feels like a money scheme. I canceled my subscription renewal, and while it should remain active for 2 more months, it appears to have cut me off. The feeling is mutual."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely Handy for an ADHD Adult.... Helping myself with less meds! Great üëçüò∏ app check it out. Thank you üëçüôè!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bakwasss"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I absolutely love this app but now I can't afford the payments. Definitely worth it.. if you can afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Such a scam. Don't dowload. Their ""free trial"" which is marketed as less than $2 has a hidden $90 set up fee and now they won't refund me. What a garbage app and company. NEVER download this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Idk when but seems like i used this app before and gave it 5 stars. But not this time, after finishing the beginning it gives you a plan and it says ""it's me, the future you and I want you to know I'm doing amazing and better"" like ok great start at this app that just wants to use you for your money by using tricks. Not only that, but saying well all die eventually and to commit to the tasks that those who do are 3 times likely to achieve their goal, it's like forcing me to agree to everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is really good , the design and the idea of communities makes the app much helpful and unique but i personally find the idea of only adding only two habits now is not it. I understand the premium version thing but how it was before was much better to be honest. Now it may drive people off a little. But far from this, the app is really helpful ^^"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Some great advice offered on this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me do that which I struggle to do by/for myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This came to me at the right time. It is truly fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just fab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too hippy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel this app will help me stay on track with everything I do each day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I started using fabulous to help build that I've been struggling to build, I can't say that fabulous has helped. It functions like everyone is starting from zero. I've spent the time checking boxes, but I want it to help, not just give me boxes to check. I have now spent time trying to get it set-up for where I am in my habits, but it doesn't seem to have that flexibility. I've also tried to declutter the home page, but they are determined to advertise their other apps. The coaching can be nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged me for the app with now way to cancel the subscription!!! Do not sign up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really I would have liked a better free version and better notifications"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not as good as a different one I have had"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I definitely recommend this app to anyone who is looking for changing themselves from within. This app definitely shapes your mind"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me ¬£34.99 even though cancelled subscription and closed account. Impossible to get a refund as they say account doesnt exist. No way to complain or have direct contact only have a automated online form that no one responds to absolute con"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I had great experience with it, but the thing that I did not like is there's too much pop-ups and there's too many things I do feel overwhelmed a bit but overall a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app isn't free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Used the free 7day trial. Found it frustrating that the beginning habits were 'drink water ' and 'eat breakfast ' without the ability to skip these or move on. As I already have these habits it was a waste of my time and I didn't get to experience the benefit of the app. Also found the layout a bit confusing / messy, couldn't really work out how to add new habits or what was recommended after I had moved on from the 'water challenge'."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charges $10 for FREE trial and then bills even after cancellation. I found this app from their Instagram ad. Despite offering a two-week free trial, I was charged $10. I canceled within 2 days because the app appears to be made for teenagers who need to be rewarded for little things like drinking water and brushing their teeth. Even though I had canceled (and saved the screenshot of it) they still charged me $29.99 two weeks later. I'm still waiting to hear back on a refund for both of these."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UI is confusing. Everything is paid. Waste of time app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hate the sound effects & tricked me into paying upgrade during free trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has helped me through the hardest times of my life when I felt like I had no reason to live. I will admit I use it about 35% less now that I have more control over my depression. But I still use it almost every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app is more about upsetting other apps than the ""premium"" content it's supposed to provide. Its just an add for more garbage. Avoid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fantastic and helpful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am very grateful for joining Fab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much starting question. Bad UI they didn't even gave skip option. Gosh why would I answer these stupid question without checking app first ?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great way to help get yourself in check but if you want more then two activities you have pay üòî."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! I love how much different things it has on it I just wish I could afford to keep it üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like how easy they set it up. It's not overly complicated or overwhelming on the tasks and goals to accomplish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is amazing ...carefully and thoughtfully created to improve one's life in every aspect‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money, money, money. The free trial has three ¬£ levels, and tells you most people choose the most expensive. Once you make that choice, you then have to subscribe to a rolling three-monthly deal, which for me was about ¬£35. I thought 'No' at that point, and that rate dropped 50%. I thought I'd give it a go. Then I got presented with a Premium charge of $50, down from $200. At that point I gave up. So I never used the app, but it did frustrate me enough to energetically get out of bed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Update to my one-star review. The issue with being overcharged has been resolved, not great communication on the issue but action was taken. Thank you. I greatly enjoy the app. In only a couple of weeks I have developed a morning routine. Even if I forget to check it off I am doing the actions. I am not one to stick to things long enough to make it a habit but the way the app has you do little things that set you up for success have helped me. Just one little step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, nows it's a Scam! It is now totally impossible to cancel and they will still take money even if you have cancelled it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the ""easy does it"" nature and general flexibility of it. As someone who regularly works on weekends, the only suggestion I would like to see is the ability add the option to select your ""weekend"" or make flexible the working schedule for the habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont take free trial for one week it say that by app and when you go to payment maybe deducted all amount of subscription be carefull. thx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The graphic is great and the idea of making it like a game is kind of nice too (even though I don't find it engaging), but the monthly subscription is far too high for the product and what annoys me for real is that the cancellation process is not straightforward. It looks like they try to trick you and make you pay as you forget to cancel. The support that gives is kind of ok, but it doesn't worth 35 box a month. And they know that,that's why when you try cancelling they offer you ¬£1.70 a month"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I cancelled my subscription but today there was an attempt to take ¬£35 how can I stop this as I have uninstall the app.m"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't try the free trial. I went on there and cancelled it before the deadline, I didn't even use it and they still took my money!! I would really like a customer service number so I can get this fixed because that's so sketchy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"it's good to have the reminders pop up - not sure it'll be worth it after the trial period ü§∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything gets unlocked when purchased. Nothing's free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Early days but good so far on day 2"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took the free week to know this app. Cancelled subscription the day before it expired. BUT it charged me anyway!!! Mailed to support, wait four days as they wrote. And nothing happened - no response, no money. Nice app and service!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great and friendly atmosphere that is added to every morning of my live. No more social media to start a nervous day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to help organize priorities and structure them in a way to make them stick!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the fabulous app right after signing up for the trial, but was charged for the clarify app, another app that I never downloaded to my phone. And when I asked for a refund, I got an email saying I had to wait because your mailbox was overloaded. That's a good enough reason. Then you said it was past the refund deadline, and didn't refund me. Don't live like that, karma will make you poor forever if you're greedy for money that doesn't belong to you. And now I can't even delete my visa"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything behind a paywall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I subscribed to Fabulous app for a 7-day trial and it cost me only 0.90 EUR. I cancelled the subscription before the trial expired. 6 days after the trial ended, my card was charged 36 EUR for subscription I never consented to. Another two withdrawals were attempted. I panicked and alarmed Fabulous support and they indeed replied. Thanks to Eduardo and Gabriela, my money has been refunded 15+ days after. Thank you for responding and helping me! The app is great but the stress was unnecessary."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WORST APP EVER!!!! I did the ""free"" trial, canceled within the first 24 hours and they charged me TWO different times on my credit card, even though it was supposed to be free. I have reached out to the company and have noted NOTHING back. This is a SCAM when you cancel it doesn't actually cancel and they just continue to take your money and not get back to you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's always stay by me side & keep motivating me all time. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont go by the amazing youtube poster ad, the app is a scam. 1.W/o knowing results, how can you ask user to pay during signup. 2.Even for free trial, there js payment. 3. why arent there multiple choice options under problems-prcrastination,neg self talk etx..why only 1"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I haven't used this app since I downloaded it last week. But i have multiple charges on my credit card from them for $40"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy going and amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Won't refund me even though I canceled my trial beforehand Update: still no changes. There isn't even an option to remove my payment method so I'm not charged again. Put a stop payment for this ridiculous app that seems to have no actual humans running it. Edit again: finally received my refund after sending 10 emails/refund requests starting September 28th. DO NOT sign up for the free trial because they will charge you, and there is no option to remove bank card info."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the simplicity and how it starts slow and allows you to gain a rhythm . So you build a more lasting foundation and know that true sccsess starts with small steps. This app is something I've been searching for a while now and after a week of use I'm completely hooked."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very productive app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I love the format of the app and believe it can be effective. However, some of the goals assume I go to bed at night. 3/7 days per week, I work overnight at the hospital. These days also vary week-to-week. I think this app expects more consistency from my work and sleep schedule than is feasible for my situation. Very disappointing! I will continue to try, but I think this app may be M-F, 9-5 normative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly, lot of comercials for other apps: impossible not to click on it; subscriptions and memberships are hidden and cannot find them and remove them easily. So disapointed..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free. You get far into setup before you find out you can't even try it for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad experience!!! You have to pay just to see the app, and the free trial and payment plans are confusing. Feels misleading, and your payment is linked to auto-renewal, so be careful. No refund for the browsing fee. I deleted the app and canceled auto-payments right away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged over ¬£22 gbp despite cancelling on the first day of my free 7 day trial because it didn't suit my needs. What a rip off! Don't buy this app it is worthless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hello. My subscription which ends in April says ""no subscription "" on the app. I have sent you an email with the attachment but have rest no response"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed the free trial and had an awful experience with the app. I hated the impossibility to not say ""no, thank you"" to the suggested first habits to track. I need to be able to consent to doing activities in an app, if I am forced to do the actions in a rigid way, I just cannot stay with that. I need to be able to explore and create my own container. I uninstalled directly. Now I see that I have been charged for a year because there is no reminder of the end of the free period. No refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory monetization, Can't even use free trial without entering credit card. Deleted immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app make me better, I hope this app can make my mind clear"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service from Fabulous App. I sent a request for a refund and cancellation of my subscription on October 3rd, but I've been waiting for over a week with no response. Despite my attempts, you continue to send me invoices. This is unacceptable. Please address my request promptly!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like I found an app that push me to take baby steps to my dream oh so gentle and I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This Application is absolutely Top-notch. You can see the efforts taken to make you do better from the beautiful interface to every other aspect. I wish some more features can be made available to free users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Emmm this app actually gud It can keep u motivated But I always hate when they ask for get Premium like aah why do have to pay let it be freed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't, don't, don't subscribe! Absolutely scam. It started okay but when I wanted to cancel my membership before the low cost trail, it's impossible to do so. No in app cancellation possible and refers you to the web present. I've tried to log in, now my email is not linked to the account even when it's the same email on my phone and fabulous account. Toooooooo much hustle to resolve those things. Terrible experience!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app stole 29.99$ directly from my account, not via Google Play, 2 days after i cancelled the free trial subscription. It seems like a scam. I'm still waiting for their answer after 6 business days. I'm not the only one with this problem, there's a whole thread on redit on this topic and some people have been waiting for their refund for more than 9 months and still didn't get it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"actually this app is good i had tried this app before this app change to money oriented app. but now this app want to take your money before you have tried it and so expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Behavioral research is built into every journey, challenge and practice session. Start building habits today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I am so confused on the sign up procedure. I signed up somehow for $1 to try the premium. It wasn't clear that there was a actual free subscription that I could use without giving any money up front. The app wouldn't let me verify with my email address. When I clicked verify on the app it sent me to my email. Which then sent me to the browser and it seems like the app is on free subscription and the browser had the premium trial. I canceled and took screen shots. Seems very scammy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow.. what an app... I just got started.. being my morning drink of water.. here we go.. Thanks for helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Mind blowing one step to make life productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is only here to get your 40 dollars after you're unable to cancel your subscription after your trial. And then they spit in your face when you site the reason you're cancelling is the price, they offer it to you for 2 dollars a month. Delirious money-grabbers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money grab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I think fabulous could be a very good app but since it's targeted to students and people trying to form a healthy life style it shouldn't cost anything and definitely not how much it is students can't pay it because they willl most likely to be in a university and they won't have a large budget. Even if their apprentices they won't have enough money to had out freely without making their budget lower."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overall app is really good but it has a bug The app drained my phone battery a lot I hope it will improve by the time I really wanted to use the all more but it got a bug"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulosis is fantastic! It's incredibly useful and helpful, making it easy to keep everything organized. The UI is sleek and visually appealing, adding to the overall smooth experience. This app has so much potential, and I'm always happy to use it. Two thumbs up! üëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible I am unable to click on anything and can't find where to cancel so I won't be charged for something I can do nothing with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying it so far..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the app. The graphics and sounds are nice, beautiful, motivational. I like checking things off, too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Getting that extra help or reminder does go a long way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for the trial. I was unable to get my email properly synced, & it kept asking me the same questions over & over. I answered the same set 5 times, expecting different results.I was also unable to find how to manage the subscription in the app. I got frustrated and moved on. I requested a refund for the trial & the subsequent $40 monthly subscription fee within 30 days since I was not utilizing it, and it was very promptly denied. I recommended staying away from this app and company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It‚Äôs good but little bit complicated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is good, keeps me focused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It was only thanks to my determination and curiousness that by sheer luck I found how too login and eventually restore my existing journey. Again no help from the Fabulous app team. The help section or FAQ is certainly not helpful. I had to reinstall this app. Now it is not working anymore. I do not get any help from the Fabulous team üò± - earlier - Reconfirmed, Reconfirmed, Is getting more and more exciting! I get addicted üò±ü§ó Earlier:fun. some of the texts overlap, making some unreadable üò±"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far. The graphics etc, make me want to spend time in the fabulous world. I've only had a day or two, so yet to see if I get really into it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing, my life has seen permant change and my addiction is finally slowing down, thanks so much fablous, I can see chnage and I feel it. I can sleep without overthinking and work without distractions, I can propel my day and even though I do fall, it's becoming less and less and my repentance to the lord will Save and I have faith I will win, amen, hara hara mahadev, Thanks fabelous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is one of the best discipline applications ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Confusing. I almost feel I got scammed on a 'free' trial by a Disney-like app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I see they've used their psychology knowledge even when designing misleading free trial popups"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am DISAPPOINTED with this apps' payment system. Basically it a SCAM. Whoever thinking to Buy PLZ reconsider. I had subscribed for Premium this July for a Year. And this October I get message that I was Inactive so I need to Buy and Upgrade Again. On messaging the Customer care I got Reply that They COULD NOT LOCATE my email ID. So I need to send them N Number of Details. I re-checked and found the July mail I got from them with all the details. And sent them the Proof but no reply till now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless app Stop wasting your time on productivity apps It actually lowers your productivity There is no need of life lessons and stuff üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A really fabulous app This has saved me from being insane"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"All you get is payment reminder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Don't bother with this one. Everything seems like a scam. The app itself isn't user-friendly. It is unclear what you've paid for as a lot of the app contains links to pages that either won't open/ freezes/ glitches out. Apparently, you can also somehow ""accidentally"" double subscribe to paying different amounts that make no sense. Overall, terrible self care app as it has caused me more stress and discomfort than before. If there was an option to give it negative stars, I would."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I like the idea of this app. The graphics are cool, but the number of pop ups to even get into the app the 1st time is terrible. I've never seen an app this bad with asking a bunch of questions about goals that are all multiple choice instead of letting you put in your own answers, immediately asking to sign up for a free trial when you haven't even gotten to see the app yet, forcing your first goal to be drink water (can't be deleted for some reason), on and on. Too frustrating to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was so good a software, it helps you stay motivated, it gives u affirmations and positive mindset, try it, I am having a lovely experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app. Didn't like it so canceled and removed. 2 months later I get a message from my bank about them trying to take money from me. Thankfully I was able to block it Do not get this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It isn't worth that l spent mobile data"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Editing my review: after leavung a poor review here, they finally refunded the money that was taken from my account DAYS AFTER I canceled my FREE trial (with several days to spare). I had already done all of the steps in the reply you see below. Until you see ratings here that customer service is amazing, I would avoid this app and any others they run. The app itself was decent, just wasn't for me. But poor customer service is not worththe headache."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im living this aop so far... tbc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really a life changing app am happy to have this on my device and get my life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app, based on solid psychological principles. I've started drinking water first thing every morning, and I really don't like water! There are tons of little habits to build, which can lead one to live a healthier, happier life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Daily support and guidance to help you build good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"canceled my free trial on September 26th, surprise! , got charged full membership on October 5th. overall not worth $29 a month in membership. plus there was a lot of extra apps they kept on recommending on each one had another subscription charge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"the worst experience ever!!! I got charged $40 from my card but nowhere in the Play Store did it say I have a valid subscribion. After the charge i went to their website, logged in and it said i was on a free plan, so they had no right of charging me. NEVER let it get an access to your bank account!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I felt this was a bunch of adverts for other apps, which is frustrating when you're on premium, don't waste your money. There's plenty of other free resources to help you find a routine that works for you without the cheesiness and ads, ask chatgpt."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful with this app! If you enter your credit card details and start a free trial and if by any chance if you don't cancel it 24 hours prior due to your busy schedule, that's it your money is deducted, if not deducted, it'll keep attempting to charge the card multiple times until it succeeds. I would never ever recommend this app as cancellation sometimes can't be done in a regular way from Google Play Store, it has to be done on app platform. This a super shady app üò° I lost 3,388 INR."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so cute and really works to have new habits, make you feel better, healthy and organized! I loved it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires email for their spam, then still does absolutely nothing without a $52 subscription. Useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just g ot blue screen and does'nt proceed further, wasted lot of my time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"At first it give option to skip signup. It asks lots of questions then it asks email to sign up. üò†"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Better app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App won't let me restore previous progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having used this app for long, but I have to say that I love it! I wish there were more wrotten plans I suppose."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wasn't even going to review this app because I didn't have it long. I started the free trial without really knowing it, and it just pulled out two payments. One $39.99 and the other $29.99. If I could, I'd demand a refund, but I don't know how to go about it. Most subscriptions can be easily canceled through Google Play and managed that way, but that's not how this app works. I also think I've been charged more than I was supposed to be charged. It's a little scummy for a self-help app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall, this app is okay. I took off two stars because it doesn't let you open the app if you're offline. If I open the app when I'm offline, I get a popup Google Play message saying ""you're offline."" The message keeps popping up, and I have to hit the close button at least 10 times before it goes away. It's very frustrating. I have contacted Fabulous support about it, but as usual, no one has done anything. I wish they would fix it immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The rigid fixation on hydration when I want my starting point elsewhere makes it impossible to participate in the programme."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Only 10 days in but it is helping me to be consistent and stay focused on tasks I want to complete. I have ADHD so I used both Fabulous and Clarify, which makes it even better. I love the coaching and the positive reinforcement. It does take a little time to set it up at first but once that's done it's worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it as it gives you a sense of gratitude.its great app I have no complaints and no words to describe this amazing app üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely not what I expected. I couldn't even get the day one ads in my 7 day free trial. it already got me to agree to pay the 20 bucks and still flashing ad after ad to sign up for the premium or the next best plan they had to offer. Also the advise and strategies and reminders to wake up and drink water was as far as it goes with any type of coaching it does for you. it's a joke and no where near anything I thought it was going to be or could have been. it's a scam!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a very useful and good app for adhd. You can set a timer for each task that's great. I like it a lot, but I felt the lack of two options. 1- The notes I write in the tasks don't stay for the next day. 2- This application on watch for those times when you can't use your phone, but you are addicted to Fabious, so I want to be able to install this application on my watch as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I haven't gotten to experience the whole experience from the app to complete an honest rating. But so far it seems to gone solid advice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to follow, practical advice, positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This company has terrible customer service and makes a lot of claims they don't follow through on. Especially when they claim to be beneficial to people with ADHD. I do not recommend them or any service that doesn't truly understand the brains of neurodivergent individuals with different needs and challenges. Pomodoro timers are free on YouTube or purchase a cheap one somewhere and do 30-minute increments to complete tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unauthorized charge attempts repeated multiple days but luckily my CC company has flagged these as probable fraud. Do NOT download this scam app. Based on response: if it is concerning then please insure that further fraudulent attempts are stopped and honor my request to remove all account info from your service. I have email confirming these requests. And the attempted fraudulent charges continue days later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free if you have to pay for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I liked the app just couldn't afford the premium and I didn't like that I had to connect my google acct with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used this for the last 15 months, and it has empowered me to build healthy routines, lose weight, and renew my positive outlook on life. It's been a godsend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I've had this app for 3-5 years, and it's got a diverse toolkit and structures your habits for you in storytelling adventure type journeys. It's fantastic if you're starting your habit journal. But after 4 years there's still many basic issues. EDIT: As of 7/7/24, the app has so cluttered with routines showing up 3 times on the main screen and it is filled with self advertisements that are not removable. EDIT 10/5/24: Came back to the app, got advertised to 5 times before even getting in. Nope."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has given me a support system, and also made me create a social support system to aid me in achieving my goals. I feel less alone. I've formed healthy habits, and aim to create more. It has made me kinder to myself also."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I selected the 1‚Ç¨ price and my PayPal account says that I've spent 16,41‚Ç¨. At that point I thought ""ok well I will try to use it"" and it bugged 3 times consecutively in one of the first screens, freezing and forcing me to close and reopen. Once I've managed to finally create the first ""unexpected journey"" it felt really intricated and full of unnecessary modals. The website keeps suggesting other things to buy and is overcomplicated to find any real useful thing like the refund. It feels scammy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"exceptional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I Only just begun but so far it seems very motivational. This app seems different from the others in the fact they still give a lot of helpful content in the free version. Most only give u snippets or a lil taste and everything else is locked unless you pay up. I Would definitely like to upgrade to the full version after Free trial to take advantage of the full program. I like that there are experts providing content as well. I can use some motivational, uplifting coaching in my life for sure üòä"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app is excellent but I'm rating this low with a heavy heart as it took away all my money that I didn't enroll for. I wanted to get the weekly trial only but it automatically enrolled me with 1:1 coaching session and clarify app. I even submitted refund request w evidence but I didn't get any response back. Now, I resubmitted the request. I used android to get trial, it didn't show any purchase history on playstore on the phone but the desktop did. I'm really hoping they solve the issue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription 3 days after subscription and it still auto renewed and the fees were taken (stolen) from my account. This app is not legit and is a total scam, no do subscribe they are scam artists üò§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled 3 days after I started the free trial and was still charged. Sent an email to support and still haven't received a respoweek3 weeks later. Don't do it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This might be scam. They will take your money without you knowing. Please don't try to subscribe premium. You will cry too like I did. Let me be the last person getting scammed by them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is super scammy, deducted my money for plans I DID NOT SUBSCRIBE TO. I then went to Reddit and saw multiple other similar stories. There's no easy way to ask for refund either. I got an email saying my money has been refunded but it was not? This is an app that takes advantage of people with ADHD. The navigation in the app is so difficult, there's no back button, not place to properly navigate. I am not even sure how this app has so many good reviews."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app with impressive motivations....Its definitely work and worth....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app and support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had bad experience trying to cancel....cancelled before trial ended and yet charged on my credit card. No way to check status from what I can see as it's not routed through Google and no apparent way to check acct info within the app. Everything with it is roundabout...no clear menu to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app it will definitely help you I bet"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app so far! Even in only two days of doing tasks i feel more productive and alive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I didn't get a chance to use the app, it did look like a great product tho. I just could not afford it at this time, hopefully in the future. They processed the refund of the first charge within 5 mins of me submitting a refund request. I've never seen customer service this good. I'm very impressed. Hope to be back one day, especially now knowing how customer focused they are."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just a couple days in, but already notice a tiny shift in my own habits and self worth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have canceled this app twice and just received a notice from my credit card that they are trying to charge me again 39.99. How? Not happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"High potential, truly horrible. What an incredible waste of opportunity. You'd think it's good qualities would make it better, but they just make it harder to stomach. There are solid tools here and good advice, COMPLETELY SUBVERTED by the endless barrage of interrupting advertisements that turn their big talk about ""calm, focus, peace"" etc., from a possibility into an ironic and sick joke. And this is WITH a ""premium membership"" Gross."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Very Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very expensive for students"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful for me ü•π"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Major gripe: you cannot cancel premium membership from the app. Maybe that's because of Google play policies, I don't know. Minor gripe: you cannot disable these long animations, and need to wait. As a person with ADHD, I can't tolerate this well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app makes it impossible to cancel your subscription your self without contacting them. Also if you have to reinstall the app and then have to restore your purchase it won't work, it can't find it and you can't restore your profile without purchasing the premium again so you're basically stuck. This app is not user-friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing!!! Helps me to focus on important matters üòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used this app before there was a pay wall for minimal usage. It helped me get on track and overall get into a routine I liked. Eventually I left, now that I wanted to try again it asked for alot of information and a pay wall for what use to be basic functionality. I decided to delete it seeing how restricted the app is and to my surprised, they have no option to let me delete my account and information. Sent in a ticket and haven't heard anything back so I decided I'd leave a review to warn."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm trying something new with this program. So far so good I like the new habits I'm learning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everything is good, but it could really use a widget on home screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Revolutionary to me, but I'm not sure if it's just the ADHD in me. Hopeful for the first time in a very long time. I'm 57 and just started learning about myself 8 years ago, and this gives me practical ways and/or steps to work on. We'll see!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it so Fabulous üíõ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's only been my 2nd day... and I'm starting to participate. Don't know for sure but it kinda does help getting myself into a routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't work, could not get refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Why am I not able to use the app in offline mode? Does the app always need an active internet connection to work? That's strange... Dev team please respond Also the app is now over cluttered with its sister app promotions. I bought fabulous for the clean experience but sadly now it's become commercial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for beginning new routines and changing old ones. A little goes a long way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"the most satisfying and journey of discovery you will start on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First thoughts is very interesting, and I'm hoping long term, that this will be a positive investment. Definitely interesting enough to give it a red hot crack."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Your the best fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a really good app but not for me though I'm still a student so I don't have money for it üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Recently switch to a new phone, but unfortunately, this app has been frozen beyond the front page, and all I get a generic bot response to see the ""help section"" which I cannot access because, one again, the app freezes after the intro page. Is anyone at the firm even maintaining this app anymore?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UPDATE A YEAR LATER: They are STILL up to their fraudulent unauthorized charges AGAIN! I signed up and cancelled my subscriotion over a year ago yet they continue to hold my bank card information and charge my me a year AFTER I've unsubscribed. These are organized criminals. I had to call my bank today, file a FRAUD report and now wait for a new bank card to be delivered. I'd like to see Intetpol investigate their criminal activity. Don't believe their false responses."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BACK AWAY FROM THE FREE TRIAL! I signed up for one week free trial to renew at $39.99 per quarter. That same day they took $67 from my Pay Pal account. I already got squared away with Pay Pal and the bank. Then today these shucksters force me to ""request a refund"" for money I never gave them. WHATEVER"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The studying and learning new things is my favourite the music is so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have to give all the information and in the end it says paid app. Without paying or providing the card details you cannot use any feature of the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi!! My account is blank I don't have any money yet I have received msg multiple times from my bank that transaction to the fabulous app was failed. although I'm not using your app anymore and I have seen every possible option but not able to remove card from play store. Can you please kindly remove my subscription ( that I have not subscribe and you're imagining it) and not to try to make any transactions and also delete my account as your app is draining my whole batteryüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app for lazy people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't want to pay for anything. Stop trying to take my money. Edit: I went to the webpage to cancel the unnecessary subscription and I DID but messages are still coming through, telling me that my online banking limit is being exceeded. I. DON'T. WANT. TO. PAY. Cancel my damn subscription!!! Not only that, but your email doesn't work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started using today but I have a good feeling about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I don't think we should have to pay $$$$ üòû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You guys rock"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Uninstalled the app after filling the start survey, the way they try to push their subscription by first showing a lower amount and no free trail and then when u reject suddenly u get an 'offer' of free 1 week, seeing the other reviews on Play Store regarding their subscription issues and the fact they don't even let you see what the app has to offer to u. I would first like to see if the app works for me before adding payment info"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the amazing app to find yourself with step to step routine to be productive and find mindfulness.great user interface..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helped me pull myself together and believe in myself. This app also helped me realize that my goals aren't realistic. I highly recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great motivator. Keeps you on track. Commitment training. the achievements feel good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good. I've only been using it for a few days. I'll update the rating when I've used it longer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for an hour, and I feel like I'm going to start a new chapter in my life because of this app, and I am ready to make this my best chapter."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Vvery useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to get the plan"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This daily routine app has helped me tremendously stay committed on a consistent basis. Some days, when I wake up, I literally have forgotten what I need to do. So I opened my app, and it's all there, I proceed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelkent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm broke and this asking me cash üíÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app and can improve anyone who wants to their goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app will ask for your money to subscribe to the program right away without showing you what so great about it. DON'T INSTALL IT! Their principal is to charge you first and show you later. Nothing is fabulous unless they show you the proof before you paid. They even charges you for a 14-days trial. That is how fabulous they gets."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you are not taking subscription then also it give that much features to motivate you through thoughts and mechanisms and help with your habit improvement with 1 step. I really like action reaction concept. Thanks developer I really need it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app and I recommend it to you because this app has helped me a lot Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very deceiving app. Main purpose if just to get money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Premium membership is really worth the subscription costs. This is so far the only App that has encouraged me to ""get past myself"", past the self-imposed limits and blockages I used in the past, to keep me from changing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far is good! But be prepared for doing doing and doing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't login! Changed the password, got a notification saying it's updated, but can't login using it, so gave up on this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly amazing, inspiring, life changing. So well crafted and nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam, they push to get info out of you, get your email, then you can't do anything without paying. This is not an app, it's a subscription. Shame on you for taking advantage of people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÿßÿ≠ŸÑŸâ ÿ¥Ÿä ŸÅŸä ÿØŸàŸÜŸäÿßÿßÿßÿß"

The daily Pledge we took is the greatest Motivation to start a day. Must Download ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the app. I feel like it's allowed me to make changes. I love the coachings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total scam, avoid!! I downloaded it to try and instantly cancelled. I have since me charged a full month's subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fully paid app, Not recommended, not sure who are all providing good rating to this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I used this app for a lot of time and it has brought a lot of changes in my life,routine and habits.It has inculcated good habits in me and made me feel that life is in my control finally.It gives you a personalised journey where you improve on your routine and be more productive.So far I'm very satisfied with this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I never rated any app in my life ever before but , this is really fabulous üòç I hope it keep updating ü´∂üèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I can't unlock some the stuff on it without bringing ad . Premium should not be a compulsory stuff now. Especially fir muddle schoolers like me..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a pretty beautiful app üíùüå∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was a nice planner for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I ever installed. It helps me to change deeply and brings the best out of me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app... Edit- Pls add water drinking reminder every hour Eye movement excercise every hour (For mobile user or computer user) Daily photo upload and telling us about our daily progress Etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"unauthorized charges years after canceling a free trial early"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Poor experience. From the get go, you are bombarded with pricing plans when signing up with 5 different pricing tiers? The app eventually settles you on a free trial. Advertisments state you fill in a 3 questions and it forms some unique personal profile which will revolutionise your life. First goal was to drink water? Kept giving me reminders to do this? Goal list very complicated to use. Random notifications. Quite difficult to cancel - like a pinball machine, and very glitchy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another app I was charged for when it was meant to be a free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraud. I have reported this app several times in the past years for trying to charge me for services I had not signed up for after using the ' free trail' and then canceling because i did not find this app helpful. I have reported this to Google multiple times and the company itself. And I get zero help what so ever. I will be reporting this company to the Better Business Bureau for scamming its consumers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it is insightful but still to early to tell."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Membership on Monthly basis is High."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged $35 for the ""premium"" membership without ever signing up for it, and I've never even used this app. Don't download."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First they gave me a fomo of purchasing a plan for ‚Çπ66/week and 7day trial before that. I choose no and it said this offer will not come for next 12 months. I opted for it then on billing page it turned out $16.99 for 3 months and according to math thats not ‚Çπ66/week. I still opted for trial and went ahead. After this it kept popping this and that offer. It did not let me inside to see for what I will be paying and their cancel subscription flow is also the worst the button does not work. 0 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got this app for my adhd but this app took around 60 dollars out of my account (thirty dollars two times each). I'm sixteen and that is like half of my paycheck, I'm really upset about losing all that money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, I've tries habit trackers to implement new habits, and sooner rather than later, I end up not using them at all and not accomplishing my goals. I have to give it to Fabulous, this is by FAR the habit tracker I've used the most and not just that, they way it is built really encourages you to keep going and being kinder with yourself when you mess up. The psychology behind this app is wild! I absolutely love it! The coaching audios they have, can be very motivating and eye openers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Riddled with premium stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is best app and life changer experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really dissapointing! I took a 14 day trial and cancelled my subscription 2 days prior. And guess what? The amount was still deducted. I reached out to the team, no reply. Do you care to solve this query?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a great app for me. It keeps me accountable, motivated and provides cute, educational motivators along the way. I'm glad I added this app to my repertoire towards better health and well-being."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulant billing! I signed up for a free trial of the fabulous and was immediately overwhelmed by the app, so i cancelled my subscription within a day or two. i noticed a few weeks later my paypal was charged $1. Then later it was charged 29.99, despite my status on the website confirming i was not on a paid plan. i have attemped several inquiries to resolve the issue, but still have not been able to reach an actual helpful link, article, or service agent. Very disappointing amd frustrating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using it and so far 11 days I've been able to stick"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing complete app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My first impressions: Loving it so far, i feel rewarded, lots of positive reinforcement! I later subscribed as my morning routine i made on fabulous really helps me to get ready and consider all that i need before setting off. Having prompts to remind me of what i may need to consider taking, saves me having to think of everything and i can just tick of whats relevant and get going. It saves me mounds of mental energy and im more prepared for what the day has to throw at me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëçüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not user friendly! Full of glitches. Can't even submit a help request. Can't remove hydration reminder. Clearly this business lacks the infrastructure to scale and deliver even basic services like a user manual. But the ideas and graphics are sweet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like the daily and nightly coaching a lot. I also like the graphics, it's quite beautiful and engaging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really good. Should try"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"interesting insights in coaching"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just Start it !! Rest will be taken care off"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is just the accountability I been needing! Super excited to finish as strong as I started."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had an extremely disappointing experience with the member care team. Despite numerous attempts to get a refund for a service I didn't use, they were unhelpful and dismissive. Their responses were slow, and they showed no willingness to resolve my issue. I feel completely ignored and cheated. This level of customer service is unacceptable. I will not be using their services again and advise others to be cautious."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm back and this app is wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think I finally found precisely what I've needed for some years now. Optimistic..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only just started using this app, and am loving it already... ‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well researched and sought after information advising not only steps towards habits necessary. Also, provides the reasoning behind what makes the beneficial. Shares tips and tricks of how to start working towards adapting and adding them into your routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App just froze. Also, you keep charging me even though I cancelled. Stop."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like trying this app it was really helpful and fun to use it to start new habits and be more discipline to it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful app. Not at all as described in the ad. Really difficult to cancel. And massively expensive for what it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"STAY AWAY. Deceptive billing. Paid for a one year membership yesterday through Google Play, after a short trial. Received an email offering a free additional 3 month extension if I re-signup directly. That free three months was a 90 day trial, and I would be billed for a full year after 90 days... Wait, what? I just paid for a year *yesterday* Fabulous is trying to get around paying fees to Google Play, and is doing so in a way that would overcharge the user."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping myself accountable. ü´Ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription and got charged still. I checked the app and online and both said it was indeed cancelled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es una experiencia agradable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still early days but a digital accountability coach that will gently usher you to a better version of yourself. To everyone trying it keep it up and build the habit even if you stumble."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could give them zero starts I would have. The app is absolutely useless and just sends you notifications and clutter your phone. The automatic payment structure is absolutely opaque. The way to cancel subscription is so confusing that I ended up being paying 80 euros because I assumed I had canceled their useless service when in reality you have to jump through many hoops until your subscription is canceled. The continue with cancellation button is hidden at the very end! This is a disgrace"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great start!...Installed twice already and still can't get past the first page without it crashing!! Membership plan cancelled immediately!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged in error after cancelling my subscription over 3 months ago. And they refunded me and assured me over email my subscription was cancelled. Today my account was debited again by them and I will have to go through the hassle of organizing a refund again and wait a week for it to reach my account. Joke of a company porporting to be helpful people suffering with ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's very helpful for me Thank you üíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Owsam experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still in the trial phase, but so far so good! Im working on building good new habits. The format is easy to follow and pleasant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Build my habit thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's really hard to underestimate how horrific it is to make people try to find this on the web to cancel and to make it impossible to cancel from the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't agree to a subscription fee when setting up an account to view the app and how it all works /looking at plans, but had $25 withdrawn from my PayPal. Also app is very overwhelming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is very interactive, I like it. But I'll give 4 stars for now, see how it goes after a few days first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Over the last eight years or so, fabulous has become my personal life coach, helping me build structure to my life and helping me to attain new habits and accomplish goals while feeling like I'm becoming a better me in the process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"See, I love this, however I'd reccomend getting dark mode, please?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Customer service is TERRIBLE! It doesn't exist. I tried to contact them multiple times and only got one useless response. They said i could ask more questions by replying to the email, but I still haven't heard back almost 2 weeks later. I was able to cancel, but since support won't respond, I want able to get clarification on anything. I'd like to get a refund for the duplicate purchases you pushed through emails. EDIT: I asked for support at the address listed, with no response after 2 weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for habit and routine management. And great new features they keep adding. Excellent companion for making long-lasting changes in lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid $16 for the premium trial and it doesn't let me see anything premium. I'm def canceling before the trial ends. The UI for starting to use the app after starting the trial is EXTREMELY confusing. The original intentions seem to be getting lost in the pursuit of higher sales. Smh. I had high hopes for this one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Literally change my life. Any time of day you feel zoned out just breathe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just wish if it was free....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Having too many technical issues"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This helps more than any goal app (not that i actually keep up with those). Try it out, it's worth the $16 and it makes my day better I'm trying to be healthier and this is def helping"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My world is turning around this is the best app I've ever added in my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find fabulous really useful. It helps me keep track of all the things I want to do and also helps me develop new ways of thinking/exploring how I do things. I have had it a year and have just renewed my annual payment as I have found it so useful. I recently started using it in conjunction with Shape and am finding the combo very good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed it after 3 years and it still starts with the goal 'drink 3 glasss of water' and does not allow to set further targets. Man! I already do it. Can we move further?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Way to scattered and difficult to keep up with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hate it. Just wants you to pay for a membership and leads you down different routes to do so. You click on something, answer questions and then it tells you that only premium members can get the answer. Waste of time. Then when you want to cancel, you can't even do it on the app, have to go to the website."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You can't add things into your routines. You just get a payment plan thrown in your face. Terrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‡¶∏‡¶¶‡¶´‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*Edit to say I know how to manage subscriptions, been doing it for years now, thanks. Unsubscribed (using the proper channels in Google Play) the day I downloaded the app to prevent it from charging me, yet it still charged me $40 today! This app is not worth that. Deleting it, and have no interest in the free version. You'll probably still figure out a way to charge me with that version! Shame on you! #NotSoFabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible app filled with bugs. I could not get passed the first screen so I cancelled my free trial and uninstalled, 2 months later I was charged for the subscription. I have submitted 3 ""request forms"" on their website over the last month and yet to get a single response or my refund. Evidently this company does nothing but wait for people to forget about this subscription to charge ridiculous prices for nothing. Horrible app, horrible company, download if you want to waste money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This company has refused to respond to my refund request, they frodualantly charged my card without my authorization an additional 40 dollars. They've leaked my log in information the morning of re-writing this review. I've now had to involve my bank and Google to combat this company and I will personally be undergoing an international lawsuit against them if they do not yield to the bank. PLEASE AVOID"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Initial setup was deceptive. It Said ‚Äùtry Fabulous for free for 7 days"". I guess I'm sensitive to precise language. That led me to believe there was no free version and I got stressed and almost put in my cc. It Should have said ""try fabulous premium for 7 days "" and had a button to continue with free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I appreciate yall so much, Design: fantastic! Thought threw responses: Astounding! Support & encouragement: Exponential! I haven't even met people with this Level of Understanding, i would LOVE to actually meet the developers and see that team aspect! ü§Ø YALL NEED TO DO A TED TALK!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is too annoying when the subscription is concerned. It insists way too much for you to pay for a subscription plan even before you get a glimpse of what the app is about. I uninstalled it and still got billed later for a subscription I didn't ask for but probably accepted at some point unaware of it. Thankfully I managed to refuse, but it is still frustrating to deal with. It takes away from its own coaching experience, a shame because otherwise, it is a good app and fairly priced imo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, so far. Has a wide range of readings/quotes and mental/emotional well-being exercises. Much to explore. I keep coming back after gaps (necessitated by overwhelming work schedules). Would be great if a few more writers, therapists and philosophers are quoted from different regions of the world."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very calm & relaxing. I like it a lot. Hopefully, it doesn't change on me after the trial ends"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the positive reinforcement this app brings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"From a free to play standpoint, this app is very pushy. Every press or action leaving to a new way to try to get me to sign up to a 'free gift', 'be a better me' and pay pop up. I get it guys, you have mouths to feed. I like the principle though. Simple to use and idiot friendly (I appreciate). Pretty etc etc. But I get a feeling that less (or more for the free user) could be more. I'll give an extra day or two, but if one needs to pay to play, I'm out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me for a trial but it won't work... What's going on?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceling is a nightmare! Don't sign up for the trial. Its not worth the pain of trying to cancel the account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Been trying to cancel my subscription as the free trial didn't work for me and it's not allowing me to cancel...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I use 7days trial. When i have money i think i will purchase for 1year subscription to see if this works for me. So far i have done small steps. The apps makes me aware my goal as we focus on the small steps first which is achievable. Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App took info to set up and then stayed frozen on opening screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't have subscription and today I was attempt 2 different payment with 2 different amount. I really don't understand. I am going to delete the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*And now they're responding to this review, but still haven't responded to the refund request I*already* sent through the channels they're suggesting before posting the review. (And again, I never should have been charged in the first place.) SHADY. This app charged me and I never even completed a profile with them. I started answering their in app questaire, decided it looked scammy and stopped. But they charged me anyway. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I just wish √≠t was free and I wouldn't have to pay but I know it's part of business and business is business. Goodluck Fabulous ü•∫üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great.. I have been really struggling to find purpose or meaning in my life. Now I have it. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First asks a ton of questions, then wants about 15 bucks. I feel the app is not upfront with costs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Feel conned! Installed paid ¬£14 for the trial period, then instead of getting to the app got 4 screens with varying prices was so miffed that I wasn't even in the app yet √¨ uninstall and went for a refund from Google, the app wasn't anywhere, that's when I realised I'd been taken out of Google to a website for payment, I'm not bothered about the money as such it's the underhanded way it was done, anyone know how I make Google aware of this?edit don't trust u bad experience already!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's barely any features and they still expect you to pay $40 a month. I signed up for the trial to test it out, didn't like the interface or the features available, and barely used it. Upon trying to cancel my subscription I have hit a wall and am waiting on help to cancel the subscription as it's not letting me do it by myself in my subscriptions list (not even listed in my subscriptions list) and it continuously keeps trying to charge me for an app that I myself can't unsubscribe from. BS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very amazing app. I like it very much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a game changer for my life. I used to wake up and doom scroll and not have any intention for the day, now I feel very accomplished in the mornings. I have learned about myself and grown in many ways. It's a great app highly recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What can I say, another app that only wants you to pay up, or it will not work, instead of making people drink more water and doing stuff that has ver little impact, you should help people deal with thier main problems. stop wasting people's time on little things and change thier life for real"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Costly and not comfortable app. Every step ask paid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing supportive app thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have already paid for the 2 weeks trial and it just brings me back to the same questionnaire over and over again and asks me to pay again!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday for years!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app of all time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the trial and realized quickly that this app is not for me. then I got sick and forgot to cancel in time, and today they tried to charge me $40+$30 (=$70!!!! total). Thankfully my credit card company immediately blocked one of the charges. I cancelled my subscription but I think it's extremely shady business. I didn't get a single reminder that I was about to get charged, no email, no notification. Unfortunately I lost $40 since the cancellation was too late. Very frustrating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to stay motivated and build the new habits that change outcome one's desire. The app will guide you every step of the way. I personally love the daily couching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription within the 7-day trial period and deleted the app because it was too basic. For example, it kept telling me to drink water first thing in the morning, with little other advice. I don‚Äôt see why I should pay a monthly or yearly fee for something so simple. Weeks later, I received an email saying I owe them ¬£34.99. This is confusing, as I canceled within the free trial period. Why am I being told I have an outstanding payment due?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Impressive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It starts with very simple daily habits . I have only completed 1 full week and honestly feel so much better . I bought the prime membership right off the bat because I knew I wouldn't use it unless I paid for it lol. With all the other free apps included , I now wake up on time , eat breakfast , stay hydrated , and sleep like a baby . I recommend this app to everyone ! My total mental and physical well being has improved greatly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The very first piece of advice, to change the nature of habits, makes this worth the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the overall experience of seeing and trying all these new and different ways of bettering myself which in turns helps my mental and emotional well being. It is an integral aspect which enabled me to be a better; wife, mother, friend and person. So, I thank you for creating this app that equips people, like me, to be better than they were and better than they are. It really does work if you're willing to put the time and work into it. Keep up the great work guys! üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm learning a lot about me here, give a try‚ú®üî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"10/25/21 Review: This app is pure pleasure. Lots of special moments that I did not expect. And it also works üòä‚ù§Ô∏è Update 09/24. I am still using this app today and I still love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great buddy to have on your side in the darkest of your times. Just be patient with it. Result is pakka üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy S10. Keeps freezing when I tap on the first challenge (? The rectangle) during the introduction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I've been using it for 2 years, and it's totally changed my life for the better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Saw add for this on insta looked good but then tried it. Very misleading and just started trying get money and personal information from me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I get all the way to the page that says...... Some stuff at the top but it's not all on one screen where I can see it... in the middle of the screen it says Hint... tap the fingerprint once then hold it there as a sign of your commitment..... But it doesn't finish and there's no finger print I paid 29.99 twice now and I've never seen the inside of the app or what it does... I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it still won't let me I'm it. I guess you scammed me.... twice now! Refund my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Rating low for wasting my time. On the app store it says ""in-app purchases"", but this is a paid app, you can't use it without paying. They don't tell you this until after you have filled on about ten a reens of questions... Grrrr, uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is awesome, except when I add my customized routine, it is not giving to put in notes for this added routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love this app, worth the premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the whole UI experience of the app it's beautiful üòçüòçüòçüòç really well done üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it for the first week. The idea of building habits by tackling them little by little is very useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Advertised a free trial and then took ‚Ç¨16 from my account, when I emailed for refund, I was told this was a set up fee, really confusing app to navigate, all I was doing was trying to find my way out!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. Love the colors and visual. When going into mood tracking I thought there would be more. I'm just using the app so I'll update again in about a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has kept me on point for different challenges, experience necessary changes, and a better mindset and healthier lifestyle. Though I am not perfect still knowing seeing for myself what is done daily and stay accountable doing everyday tasks and stay consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is superb productivity app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BE VERY AWARE OF THIS APP, ONCE YOU PUT YOUR PAYPAL OR CARD NUMBER THEY WILL USE IT FOR UNWANTED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FEATURES, I WAS CHARGED FOR COACHING I DIDN'T ASKED FOR AND FOR SUBSCRIPTION I HAD ALREADY CANCELLED! I ONLY USED MY PAYPAL FOR THE SMALLEST DONATION FOR TRIAL AND EVER SINCE THEY KEEP CHARGING FOR STUFF I DIDN'T ASKED FOR! IF THIS IS AN APP THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP US HAVE A MORE BALANCED LIFE ITS ONLY BRINGING STRESS TO MINE! SHAME ON YOU!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"W app if you pay L if you don't"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is a little bit cluttered and could be refined. Sometimes doesn't take when you complete something and it replays etc. [For example when collecting the ""3 morning gems"" I have 2 of 3 and then click to collect my 3rd gem it says congratulations ‚ú® etc, but then goes back to the page where I only have 2 of 3 collected and the cycle continues...] However, as a whole, the habit formings and encouragement is helpful to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm very much enjoying the Fabulous app. I like the daily routine and the boost I get from the uplifting messages and quotes. Also informing me about other writers, poets, and philosophers to research. I especially like the nighty routine before I sleep. The whole app is absolutely Fabulous! ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Am enjoying the app already after spending just 2 days hope for better days ahead that's why I didn't give it a 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been in each and every support and customer service of your app and yet to be attended to about my refund I was charged over $50 for one year subscription and all I did while using the app is choosing free trial, so why the charge ? Please kindly work on my refund I love the app but with this I can't even rate this app one start because I have been sending my details for almost a month now and nothing to show for it They keep asking for details Please work on it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I love that the app is judgement free and very supportive in the change process"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really nice!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Very insightful. Definitely inspirational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love these apps and have purchased most of them to help me try and get my life in order and to try and live positively even if things can be negative once in a while. Thank you to The Fabulous team for developing these wonderful apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I truly love this app. It's been helping me get through the daze."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Buggy, Spammy but great content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"For better life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I originally rated this app 4 stars but the longer I use it, the more I put into it. I have unleashed its potential to do great things and its long term effect on my productivity, well being, and general PEACE - of mind, body and spirit. It's beautiful, backed by continuous research, and speaks to me like no other book or app before it. It's all what you put into it. Changed my life for the better and I am very grateful. ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for helping me love myself every single day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've just started but I can see this being good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years and it's definitely helped me learn to create new habits in my life. The free version even has short exercise and meditation routines built-in. I like the motivational encouragement and quotes from famous people in the daily messages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Books premium afer a year without ever using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Transform your life one habit at a time. With inspirational coaching and good references to the scientific foundations for doing things. Edit: started using it again after a break. Still loving it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life ‚òÄÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only just started with this app, but the concepts are solid. I've been able to do all the things so far easily. It's been 5 days so far and I already feel better. Just wanted to say that I am still using the app in 2024 and still am feeling better. I've been able to achieve more than I thought possible. Great app for lifestyle change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not happy with the customer service on this app at all. You can't cancel your subscription through the app itself so you have to jump through additional hoops just to cancel which is one of my pet peeves. The app wasn't for me so I wanted to cancel but couldn't figure out how, so of course I accidentally forgot about it until my free trial expired. When I saw that I was charged a day after the expiration, I reached out for a refund and of course they declined to reimburse because of the T&C's"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried it, was too unstructured & overwhelming and cancelled straight away again. Still got charged today, even though they offer a free trial period. Be aware."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's paid..u will get to know later after providing all Your information üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps you to develop habits in small steps that make you feel naturally more productive in other areas. Chores feel easier. The sense of routine has really helped my mental health too. You can build on goals at your own pace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incr√≠vel, claro, eu s√≥ n√£o consigo baixar alguns desafios. Quando eu clico, come√ßa a mostrar que est√° fazendo download, mas depois volta para a pergunta de se eu quero fazer o download e que vai demorar um pouquinho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app wish I had paid for it earlier as it's already changed my life and curbbed my spending I already am saving money irl"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app so far, particularly when it explains the science and research behind it all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Kindly make the UI less cluttered. Too much happening on the home screen. And this is the only app that has promotions in a paid version. Kindly stop advertising your other apps inside fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Considering this is a self care app, it has caused me no end of stress, frustration and upset when the subscription cancelled but you have still continued to take money, I have sent 3 seperate messages along with screenshots evidence of email confirming cancellation, confirmation from my bank etc and still have yet to receive a reply, refund or apology. Am incredibly annoyed with them, very unfair especially to those like myself where money is tight and this has effected me as a stay at home mum"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encorageing and helpful. The improvements that the developers keep adding often make the effort for the customers easier and even fun when they add in those beautiful animations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over four years (first with the free version, and now with the Premium version), and I think it's one of the best self-care apps out there. I'm a big fan of their holistic approach, and their motivational messages and art have only become better over time. There's also a great community aspect to it with the Fabulous Circles (basically a forum where anyone can post) and moderator messages. There's nothing remotely close to the quality of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why can't we use this app for free? May be with less features!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app encourages healthy habits, new routines, and gives access to many resources. It's informative yet fun and motivating. You have the control to pick and choose what you want to participate in, how much you benefit is up to you and your preferences. I mustn't forget, this app is very user friendly. Move at your own pace. Explore what you want. Call it what you want, but I call it life changing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Behavioral research is built into every journey, challenge and practice session. Start building habits today"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"never gets ahead of drinking water. Too complicated with all the unnecessary additions for other apps. Coachings and challenges ate too hard to even find and too vague to work. Most importantly, it's drawn together a bit of everything ultimately ending up in achieving nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like how practical the app is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because it's so much Beals and whistles that I haven't even gotten around to"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For trial, dialog box shows rupees 2 will be deducted, but when payment request created, it asked for rupees 1399, It looks like a fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Help people, and help yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A 5 star to 1. The app was helpful but I fell off, forgot about it. It renewed last year. There was no obvious way to cancel. I changed phones, lost access. I looked in playstore, no active subscription.I finally saw I used PayPal to pay, thank God. I put a stop payment on it. Fabulous has tried 3 times to process the invoice. A link to cust service was broken. FAQ on the site is circular. They want payment before canceling. Don't sign up! edit: No, it's not challenging. You made it challenging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid version only, no free version, doesn't work for me, uninstalling right away"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Well first things first, these guys blatantly stole the Mounument Valley IP, big time, and I know they know it. The fact they couldn't come up with their own stuff isn't very promising... I certainly won't be spending any $."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I didn't know what to expect, so I thought I would try something new. It does help me to be mindful of the small tasks that build better Habits and Accountability to myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not download this app because the company Debited Money from our bank account after getting Bank details without any permission"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy-to-use and fun, so it keeps my attention. So far so good. It's only been a few days but I can see myself continuing to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not subscribe to this app amd it wants to deduct from my account and placing my account in a minus zone. How do I stop this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great, but it would be better if you just increased the options for non-premium participants."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great self-care/ self-help app! Phenomenal with the subscription. It's not as good as it used to be without the subscription, but it's still pretty good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why did they charge me?? It kept asking me to subscribe every step of the way. Initially asked for one dollar for the trail and I paid and immediately wanted to charge more. I kept denying but today it's been a week I've barely got the chance to open the app and I'm still charged 40$$! I'm raising a dispute with my bank but tried to reach out to them. The customer support is so one sided there's no way I can get to a rep? What is the 40$ for?? Anyway, not for me. Such a scam!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a very helpful app. Make the effort to show up, and fabulous will do the rest"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Using 7 day free trial. Will see if I will continue using it. Or if needed as much ch as during these 7 days!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to test the app for a few days, so I registered and payed one dollar. Then I realised that the app freezes almost instantly on tutorial step ""Let's start with your first journey"" and you can't skip it or do anything at all. I checked my subscriptions in play market and there wasn't any, so I didn't think about it until recently the app unexpectedly charged 40 dollars. I explained the situation to the support and asked to get a refund and they just said that I can't get one. Great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Need 3 rabbits to add in free version it could be better for new members"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love this app. I've always had a lot of trouble convincing myself to get things done. The only thing I don't like a whole lot is the screen is a little bit over crowded and 13.99 a month is a little steep for me as a college student. I sadly probably wont use this past the free trial due to this. If they had a student plan I probably would tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The reason why I rated just 4 stars because the trailer version is only for 7 days, which is not enough to know every single detail about this great app, one more thing I forgot to add which is locked features within the app itself. Some kind of disappointing because it didn't allow me to have the full experience that I was looking for!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"EDIT: After unsuccessful attempts to reach their customer support for a refund, I disputed the transaction with my credit card (PayPal). Told them that Fabulous charged me despite cancelling before the trial period ended & that it may be a predatory attempt to take advantage of people with focus issues. Fortunately, PayPal refunded me. Best to dispute with your credit card as Fabulous customer support is nonexistent, as evidenced by their generic copy/paste/AI responses to these bad reviews."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"If you are looking to transform yourself and change your life, this is the app for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ok, I managed to restore the premium features on my new phone. At first I thought it's all lost."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled after the free trial and still got charged. Beware.!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Visually nice app, but it's the only one advantage. Technically it's too complicated as for daily routine app, reminds me about labyrinth. And I don't have time for this, because I want to use an app that saves my time. Also I don't understand why they are collecting your fingertips from the beginning. And it's very hard to find a delete option. By the way, cancel the subscription before you're delete your account, because you'll be charged automatically."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't do it. Cancelled my membership and they are still taking money from me with no response from the customer care team. They currently owe me $79.98, and I haven't had any kind of response in 2 weeks. This is 100% fraud. They are thieves. Spoke to Bank of America, and they knew all about this app and what they have been doing to customers. Total theft."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid for the premium service, wanting to try out what the app had to offer, but couldn't even start using the app as it freezes after prompting me to click on my first session. edit: useless reply to this from the company. You really think I didn't try all troubleshooting steps to get it to work?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app won't let me open the first journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is definitely beneficial and helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"-$67 for nothing!; this app steals your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its just fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled subscription but have been charged anyway. Also, if you don't work well with forms, the process to request a refund will be very triggering."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't know what it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money asking machine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and gentle app for ADHD-ers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best self development app I have ever used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Clever scam. Algorithmicly perfect to take money from anyone with ADHD. Might have to hyperfocus on a clawback for this one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Expected a no payment option at least for a few days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not what I expected, plus I need to pay $419 to subscribe jajajaja"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even after verifying email it says to verify again, entry should be easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm doing some of this stuff already, so it all seems based in solid science."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app .. grateful üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Customer Support non existent U can't come out of premium membership"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am giving fabulous a 5 star rate because not do they help but they also help with bad habits and I want to say ever since day one I felt like a different person so thank you to the people create this app can't wait to see where this app take meüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Insists on replacing my alarm with it's app. Had to uninstall as there's no way to undo it. Tried reinstalling but again replaced my alarm without asking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Random battery draining, i ve tried to clean the cache, but it didn't solve it. And it's not the first time. I performed a manual backup in the hope that i could restore it after deleting the app. Surprise, it did not work. I lost all my progress and started again. For people who struggle with things in life, i really do not recommend the app anymore, i paid for premium but only issues and too bloated with notifications. Tldr: don t use the app, it s buggy, and it does not really help you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Once I got into the rhythm of the graphics and story I feel in love with the app. Clearly some behavioral science going on behind the scenes. I have also started using Shape, a sister app, and find it helpful as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely and motivational app I recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam. I signed up for a free trial and I was charged for a premium membership. I cancelled and asked for a refund and was told I was not eligible for a refund. I'm not even close to the end of the 14day free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Does it actually read your fingerprint ? It asked to scan my fingerprint and I wasn't sure if it was real or not. It made me SUPER uncomfortable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is gorgeous, but extremely confusing. Part of it (a big one) is promoting their other apps and is easier to get a miracle then a refund (customer service is slow, unresponsive, and contact channels are extremely limited, you send a message to a generic email address and pray for an answer). Just think it very carefully, not for everyone, and definitely be careful with your subscription . (Look at their response to mine and other requests...generic at best. Useless.)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Messy to navigate and they find ways to charge you even if you cancel, they charged me for Clarify which is another one of their apps even though I never signed up for it. They refunded but no way I should have been charged for anything. Borderline scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm 2 weeks in. It's really effectively supportive and i love trusting the research which has gone into the decisions and suggestions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very nicely put together app but the customer service is non-existent - I would like this rectified through some direct engagement & not just an auto-generated message!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very unique experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app! It is gentle and supportive rather than pushy. The guidance, motivation, and structure is awesome. And as for the artwork - just WOW!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worthy of your time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it and trust me you willllllll love it (in ola of Lagos voiceü§≠)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved the presentation, truly fabulous üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app, signed up, did the free trial , and it immediately charged my debit card. On top of that, everytime I log in, it says that I have an active free subscription. So, I got charged $16 for a trial to an app, that I can't use, because of my active free subscription. Mind it, I just wanted to try the app out. Not get charged for something I can't use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't even work. Tried several times to reach support and they never got back to me. Seems they have a lot of work to do before this is worth paying money for. Very annoying as I really wanted to try it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App charges you without any warning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am extremely angry that I was made to feel there is a 'FREE' trial when in fact I couldn't access the app during this trial period. In addition to this, is the unnecessarily confusing procedure to access the app which resulted in me accidently agreeing to a paid coaching session that I DID NOT WANT. This all happened AFTER I opted for the FREE trial period. Furthermore, on sending an email to the company to get help with this, I did not recieve any reply till date! This felt like a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"love it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't even get in to look around the app to see if it's something I find myself using without having to give bank details. No thankyou."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"All I'm gonna say is I got charged 30‚Ç¨ for a trial period, weeks after canceling. What the frick"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid! I canceled the free trial after one second of using it, it was super overwhelming and then, after getting the confirmation email of the cancelation I got charges TWICE!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is Fab so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is not transparent with their fees and even worse doesn't let you easily unsubscribe through the app (but they have no problem letting you subscrice through the app) Considering this app is targeting neurodivergant people - I was personally targeted through ADHD related ads, this feel super intentional & lowkey predatory because of course I will forget to go through the hassle of signing in from computer browser to manage subscription after I tried canceling it the first time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Chaotic user interface, constantly trying to get you to spend more money on other apps, too many notifications to be useful. To top it off automatically renewed before I could cancel due to the overly complicated process and they won't refund me. Save your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app to enforce healthy changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Yes, ultimately we all required funds so that fabulous creators. But by making yourself worthless is not the way. I used fabulous from its inception, and I always thankful for improving my life greatly. But from 2 to 3 years all the things we get here whether those are detailed and insightful letters during journey or make me fabulous actions all are gone. Previously this is like a life coach but now this is app just another habit tracker app. May your soul rest in peace my beloved fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is simply a platform to get you to spend money on their products.. And it charges you $16 to find that out. Pass."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has a beautiful design. It has also helped me to motivate and has taught me more about myself. It's a ""fabulous"" app and I would highly recommend it to others !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Effective and full of inspiration. Thank you Fabulous App ü•∞üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have just started and it's going fine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"un-installed after the 5th question. can i just use the app already ? why i need to answer 90 questions to start using ur app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is just so amazing ,just so anyone who comes across this should download it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic experience, this app collects your fingerprint data. Is it even legal?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app to see what it could do for me. First off, it isn't free, they offer you 3 price tags starting from like 0.87p up to ¬£14+ THIS IS ONLY FOR A 14 DAY TRIAL. I chose the mid range offer and immediately had ¬£14 taken out of my account-furious!! - so not a great or comfortable start. The rest of the app is primarily pushing the companies other apps which you have to download, it's absolutely not what I'm looking for and for someone with ADHD I do not recommend it in anyway"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is fabulous! But one part I hate about it is that I can't change my picture whenever I want. It has to be done via request by contacting. I don't know why they put in such a system but I made a request and yet, it's not updated after 7+ days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like this app as much , it's just like a game , we just keep marking in this ,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app, I love that they help me create great habits in an awesome way by making it easy and enjoyable. Thank you so much . I would give 10 starts if it was possible‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app. I requested a refund because I started a free trial to help my ADHD which this app advertised it could do through habit building. Didn't work for me and thanks to my ADHD (severe object permanence) I forgot to cancel. They denied my request. I finally figured out how to cancel and do not recommend this app to those with ADHD as it seems their free trial offers are designed to specifically take advantage of those with bad memory issues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"NO FREE OPTION, ONLY PAY TO USE, unable to use so I uninstalled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app it is really helping me. Easy to use, pretty design and fun... thanks for a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish the free trial was longer! I love the app but a week is too short! I don't start my new job until next week!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't work on my phone and my request for a refund was ignored. I was forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How is it im unable to cancel subscription.. i cant even find whr to unsubscribe.. do not charge me as im not interested to upgrade or pursue ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Free Trial turned out to be the best investment I've made in a long time. If you're a single mother like me and work a hundred jobs just to keep food on the table, proceed all the way to the part where it asks you.For your credit card or debit card and make sure you put in one that doesn't go through. You may even have this option if you get to that point and just go back a page because they want you as a customer! After I put in the wrong card i was offered the free trial $20 a mon. YAY!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Using the power of story telling to help people achieve the change they desire. Brilliant. I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In a word: transformative.. in two words: naturally transformative..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am just charged 39 euros. Ridiculous. The app is not worth that money and I had chosen to pay 1 euro to try it, I do not recall consenting to continue paying premium. I want to cancel fully. I will never use it again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded and subscribed and while I was following the tutorial, it asked me to click on ""unexpected journey"" . I clicked and then the application stopped answering. So I sent a message to the team asking to solve the issue or reimburse me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a must-have for anyone looking to improve their habits and routines. With a wonderful, intuitive interface and customizable features, it makes staying organized and motivated effortless. Highly recommended for boosting productivity and wellness!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its an amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great app, I guess, except totally unresponsive. Nothing works, first mountain is unselectable, nothing is. Can't scroll, can't select, can close - at least that's working. Close and uninstall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Taking a lot of data"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like it so far. Being able to check stuff off makes me feel good. It's kind of a visual reminder of my productivity during the day, which helps boost my self esteem"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app üíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Bom at√© agora, faz 3 a 4 dias q uso"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charge subscription without advance notice, and don't reply when you contact their customer support. Not very fabulous at all, in their customer support and charging practices. Beware. ________ Still no response whatsoever to my enquiry, even though the ""Team"" is aware of the concerns, as per the reply here. Unbelievable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's better than I was thinking"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Big inspiration. LOVE it ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a nice app. Lots of cool tools available for you to track daily goals as well as inspiration."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly surprised by how effective it is, more compelling to use than other apps with this purpose. Have seen some success in how it keeps your attention."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not impressed. Does the same as any decent habit tracking app but costs money. Also pricing was unclear, you weren't really sure how much you'd pay as it'd be different on desktop vs the app. Also once you buy it you have to pay of the other apps that seem to do what fabulous claims to do. I won't say it's a scam since you do get a product that functions, but it's pretty wimpy. But it was easy to cancel so I'll give them that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App deserves trillion stars instead of 5"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What the app itself does is great. The UI has improved alot since 2021. I find it helpful for my routines. I wish I could associate apps with specific tasks so I could launch my workout app or meditation apps from my routines, for example."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is more useful app for teenegers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate this app. It's the perfect example of a predatory tech company capitalizing off of people struggling by using shallow and meaningless mental health tactics. The interface is painfully slow, there's such little customization offered, and canceling your ""premium"" (what in God's name is premium about it?) subscription is like pulling teeth. You'd have better luck just setting alarms on your phone than using this weird faux-inspirational scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscribes and gets your money through the app just fine but when you wanna cancel your subscription, it wants you go visit their website. Classic cashgrab trap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App stuck at first screen, I couldn't even begin my journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Creative, builds positive mindset , feels soothing while using it , productive becoz focuses more on consistency with small steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's awful. All of it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is not a free app. Also ever since I downloaded this specific app it downloaded other apps in background that I did not want."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"charged me two weeks AFTER I canceled the subscription through the website and removed the app. eta: I contacted customer care and was refused a refund. again, I canceled TWO WEEKS AGO and was charged yesterday anyways. scammers entirely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Arguably the worst paid app I've ever installed. I unsubscribed within 15 mins. Too much clicks and waiting to just plan stuff. The actual planning bit is weak. Hard to find basic stuff. Too much unwanted Gyan that you can't click out of. Waste of time. I just realised that I was charged twice. Sneaky"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When this app was in it's testing stage, I loved it! But they changed it and now it's super annoying. Making you go through certain tasks before you can set up what you want. Wish they would go back to the original. But that was over 6 years now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I went through several ""journeys"" a couple of years ago and it was really helpful. Now it's full of advertisements for their other apps, making it harder to navigate and confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"loving this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have to pay for a free trial and it signs you up for more subscriptions than you want automatically. Then get to the app and it doesn't work at all, just a frozen screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't even begin checking anything out - it's like the app is frozen and I'm forced to ""set up"" my account this one way, which means it's useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They scam you and tell you it's 1,11,or 16 dollars for it, but they don't tell you before you pay 30+ a month sort out your payments. I'm still waiting for my refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how it keeps me inchek with my reality..how now I can focus on growing and enjoying my solitude.i feel amaizing at the steps am taking .this app is worthit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Freezes whenever I try to ""start my journey."""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice science base app, for me it is working."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It should be free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't even use the app, it freezes every time I try to start my first journey. I've checked for updates, closed and reopened, and I've uninstalled and reinstalled and I get the same thing every time. I sent an email asking for help and have not received a response. I'm upset because I've paid for a trial that doesn't even work, I feel like I've been scammed and I can't even get in to cancel my membership. Please refund and cancel my membership. Or I will have to report this as fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So Helpfull i love it so much, with many feature so comfy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Oh this app is just scam ..... I know subscription is now everywhere .... but atleast show them first ....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've found it initially helpful and thought this would help my ADHD but all it does is try to push other apps at me and feels like it's taking advantage. And if I try to do anything with the subscription it says go to the web page but doesn't automatically open it from the app or tell you the web address and I'm struggling to find it. Which feels like a bit of a con to try and force people to stay with the app after the first two weeks trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Do you have time log options? For example when we set a reminder. And we do not do it say snooze I want to k ow at what time the taak was completed. Also, it would be nice if we have option to attach pictures,as this would help monitor when u set for someone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not from desi perspective, even driving with your mouth closed gives u better self contrl in our country"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Appreciate the positivity it offers, especially the nightly readings. The graphics make self care seem more fun, like a quest instead of a necessity. Enjoying this so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please reduce the amount of sounds during the app launch, it's irritating and discourages me from actually using the app. Thanks for your consideration."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seems more interested in getting payments than helping to activate and install"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do yourself a favour and run. Do NOT install this app. They take your money fast, but I'm still waiting for a refund as the app was Unusable. Not difficult or annoying but actually Unusable. Silence from customer service after an email telling me set up fees are not refundable. I guess everything i paid was a set up fee. I paid for a 3 month subscription. It's a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for premium subscription and can't even use the app. It tells me to click the first task but nothing happens the app just freezes. So what exactly am I paying for?!? I need this fixed or I want my money back even if I got a really good offer, I'm not just giving you a dollar for a broken app I can't even use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This application is truly genius in getting to your nerves and makes you excited to keep your schedule and motivates you. I had been struggling with the depression and negativity for more than 3 years now. Nothing worked like this app even though I had only been using this for the past week. Truly great anecdotes to get yourself out of all the negativity and self blame. Highly recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"EDIT: VERY DIFFICULT TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM PREMIUM ACCOUNT. DO NOT GIVE YOUR CC INFO There are multiple pages asking for money before I can even get into the app. Who's life are you trying to change? After agreeing to a payment structure and regretfully providing my card details, the app is still referring to me as a free user. Reeks of insincerity and money collecting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app ,user friendly UI but I give it 4 star because I do not know why but alarm feature is not working on my phone even I granted all permissions . I tried other habit apps but their alarm works even when phone screen is off but in my case alarm is not working"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving app still coming back again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unusable, it blocks after Let's start your journey. Safe to say it did do anything to calm me, it just annoyed me ü§£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app i ever found i searched so many apps thank you so much and the misunderstood i found the solution in my profile so I'm giving you 5stars without second thought thank you so much fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I doesn't work. I open it up and it just freezes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately the app doesn't work, i can log in, but then when i want to start de first step of the journey, it blocks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app for self improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not a huge fan, it can help with some daily tasks but is generally very poor value when buying their subscription. For me, the app caused more problems in my life than it fixed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Android version is much much worse that the ios one. Sent letter to the support, but did not receive the answer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's like a game and changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love this app it has definitely made me more productive, but I just wish I could add more habits to my routine with the free version (maybe 5 instead of 3?) Edit: I am sad that I can't change my habits without being asked to pay üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cute"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Did the whole long winded start process and now it just freezes when u try and start the first challenge. Closed and opened a few times, its stuck. Now I have to go through cancelling the subscription. Opposite of motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"nothing like in the pictures"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"the moving to another device is so frustrating no wonder they have a separate meditation app so i can meditate since the one on android stops responding suddenly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was stuck with this app for an entire year, because although I cancelled after a trial on one device, it apparently wasn't the device I purchased on. Horrible business model, 0/5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I'm glad that I went back to using Fabulous. Now they have many sister apps, and the ads atop my homepage are distracting clutter that I have to swipe to clear. This is despite being a premium member. Otherwise I like the updates since I started years ago."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I couldn't even encourage someone by saying God loves you ‚ù§Ô∏è or get going üí™Trust in The Lord ‚úùÔ∏è. They said ""I have used words they don't allow"" and that it's to make their community safe Christians don't support this app. There is a Kingdom of light and a Kingdom of darkness, which on is this? Also to the person from fabulous who will read this, if you're Christian God is telling me you should quit your job. If you're not Christian God wants you to have a relationship with you He knows you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish the app was available in other languages, it's very engaging and helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm excited to build some solid new healthy habits and slowly but surely change my life, my mental health and be happy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful in reminding me to keep healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! Very helpful ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª Edit: Fabulous Team is very cutesy, very demure, very mindful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I understand the concept of incremental change, but the flowery design of the app just puts me off a bit, the dr seuss-y stories don't help. I also struggle with the meditations because the ones I listened to almost sounded AI generated? Like some of the sentences didn't even make sense. Of course there's also the aspect of the cross promotion of their other apps which is both distracting and seems a bit scummy given the things others have said about the similarity of the apps to each other."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are committing financial fraud with me. I didn't sign up for this app yet they are fraudulently charging me. I know I didn't subscribe because when I try to look up my details to cancel the subscription there are no records."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't know how I got along before this app the wake up messages are a big part of my day now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. If you commit to it you can really create a routine that is personal and that works for you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I'm really excited to experience this app because, as a single mother, I'm having a difficult time staying on a schedule. I know this will be extremely beneficial for my 2-year-old son and myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amezing it can change everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Difficult in using , they use my credit card without my permission,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me to start change my live by little steps. Thanks for developers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid for a personal coach session by mistake due to many pop-up messages when I was setting up the app. Also, I verified my email, but still, the app didn't recognise it. I still cannot log in in the app, but I already paid! Keep asking me to verify my email address...insane! I was looking for support not a new problem"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this is an amazing apps .. not like other apps boring and not motivating this is THE BEST app highly recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's paid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"U r extremely fabulous and expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AS a gamer myself, treating self improvement as a video game is the ultimate fun. Every day and every tasks feels like leveling up in an RPG game... I am loving the journey so far and it is worth trying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very nice but I don't like the fact that they are always telling me to subscribe because I don't have that kind of money and I am only allowed a certain amount of tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app held my hand too tightly in a way that was detrimental. I had to complete whatever goal they assigned me before moving on to the next one, and I couldn't add another goal simultaneously. This was frustrating as the goals I was given -- drink water when waking up, eat a healthy breakfast, go for a walk -- are things I already do, but I could not decline or opt out of a goal. If this changes later on I wouldn't know as I became too frustrated to continue. Not for me, but could help others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App simply does not work with my android device. So far no support other than generic responses. Also no response to my request for a refund. AVOID."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love the app, but trying to deal with customer service is a nightmare. I purchased the premium, but they say they can't find it yet. I have 2 charges in my paypal for premium. Then I sent them screen shots of all charges, and they just asked for them again. I'm so frustrated. Just want one charge refunded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't edit my own things. Bogus app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"the application turned out to be a scam. trying to charge me for premium when I still had a free trial for three months ahead. and still trying, I wrote to support, nothing. I don't understand where so many good reviews come from?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesnt let me go through the introduction, just freezes after pulling the page to the top with top with no way to reset or move forward into the app. Very disappointed as I paid for the trial and only happy that I didnt pay more for the advanced support offered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Help! Just signed up and the app keeps repeatedly freezing/ crashing at the beginning of my 'personal journey'! I've just paid for this! Not happy. I can't even get onto step 1."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for a week free and on play store there was no subscription after 7 days I was charged 40 euros and I don't have even premium. How to solve this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Honestly, it was starting to get better , then I was asked to pay ... Seriously üòí. Thanks fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"If ur gonna have us pay for the app after we download it just hacenua pay it get the app in the first place"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's been easier to build habits when receiving direction and validation along the way!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App opens to first page then nothing further total scam and waste of money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App doesn t work for me, i have enroled for a free trial, but it is not posible to start anyyhing, it all stops on step 1- foundation, i am asked to click on first box to start program, but then nothing happens, repedeatly, website is nit helpful as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have a habit of downloading random wellness apps, hoping they'll magically change my life, but they usually disappoint. Most just let me list tasks or habits and send reminders, which only works for a few days before I lose motivation and uninstall them. However, this app is different. It offers real solutions to the challenges you face when building healthy habits. It also helps you connect with your emotions and references real studies and books, which I really appreciate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'd like to use fabulous app because it's helpful for better habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"2024: Guess I'm still paying for a subscription that's not listed here in the store. Boo! 2022: Good premise, but seems to have been through a content update or two, and the outdated pieces remain. Multiple timelines make it hard to focus on any single goal. I'm often told I will be doing things I've already done, or for a certain number of times which later changes. Extremely sentimental with surprisingly little science shared. When they somehow lost my subscription, I didn't reactivate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only had the app for a little while but it has certainly been helpful. I know with time this app will do even more to help me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Kind thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helping me set a daily routine. Also seems targeted towards young adults. I like it though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app!!!! I just wish i could afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nonsenses only"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far, I love this app. 10 out of 10 recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app to reflect on our daily challenges in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I personally use its free plan it work for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I entered my email, personal information only to find that I have to subscribe and pay for subscription. This needs to be informed plainly prior to asking for personal information. Unfortunate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's a bug on starting the onboarding where I can't click on the first menu option. So I effectively can't open the app. This after I've signed up to the premium version. Sent an email to the devs, heard no response. Luckily I'm on a trial so I'm going to cancel before it begins."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app was completely different from other apps it's will definitely change your self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The setup takes forever!! Couldn't skip anything.bs app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabolous is my best friend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Original review has it as 4*, but question was never answered**UPDATE/EDIT*** I had forgotten that I once installed this in the past, but this sounds like such a good idea for an app, but I don't think it's right that you get someone so very interested, & feeling like this is going to be a great app for ""fixing"" what is going wrong in your life. However, I think that they should tell you up front that you have to pay after a trial period. I thought it was free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Incredibly predatory and very hard to unsubscribe!! Stay away!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had never downloaded this app but somehow it charged my card as a subscription for $54.59 zero out of 5 stars. Now I am out $54."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If I do the tasks, they give me objectively good days. It's just a matter of wanting to have a good day over and over again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful art, soothing practices, fun gamified way to build new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total scam, need to report"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Most of the things are premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started a few days ago, but so far, I love it. The interface is beautiful and a lot of work clearly went into its design and execution. I started with the trial but at this rate I think I'll probably subscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Made my life easier and organized"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Frustrating. I have tried to cancel my subscription and it is extremely frustrating!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best apps to build habbits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not really transparent that whole program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the flow of the app. It's not aggressive but is insightful and purposeful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unimpressed. I'm not sure what this does besides, remind me to drink a glass of water in the morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam. Very predatory. Why are you deducting money from me. I have not installed your app nor have I subscribed. I feel scammed. It has happened for the second time but this time google play was not involved. How is that even possible. Please refund that money was meant for paying my bills. You are supposed to be helping people not frustrating them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Extraordinarily difficult to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"very helpful keeps Me On Track Even without the premium version I advice everyone to download it as long as you are not willing to ignore it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would avoid at all costs. This is the first service I considered paying for, and immediately am having issues as the app will not allow me to click on anything. I have reached out to the support team but as they take 4 business days to return a request it's not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"After a long day you feel relieved after using fabulous daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dreadful app and no user support. Will continue taking your money after you cancel subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really impossible to try it out without paying for the full version. Can't explore different features, constantly a pay block."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful experience. I don't feel the compelled need to do anything. I just get excited to do all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Been charged $65 twice now! Google & my bank won't refund me as they can't find fraudulent activity! Have photo evidence of no subscription history to this app on my google account. Never recieved a refund from them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it. Just for the fact that it applies what I learnt in James Clear's book Atomic Habits. The only downside for me is that I'm unable to use MTN momo to pay. I wish that option could be made available. So for that reason 4 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A really great app only reason I haven't given it 5 is because I got a bit lax with using it as I had a child and left my job so it was difficult maintaining it. The alerts stopped coming through and I ended up uninstalling it. A few phones later and I wanted to give it another go as I have ADHD and thought it might help maintain focus at work. I'm sure it was free when I first used it and now it isn't üò≠ now looking for a free alternative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic helping be develop healthy enriching habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful. Way to cluttered. Needs to be a much cleaner simpler interface"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What is this Sphere app the developer is still talking about? As my feedback had nothing to do with the Sphere app what ever it is. And if the developer actually use their own app, they would see reality you can't use Fabulous after the 7 day trial is up and there is no 3 journeys for free, you have to take a personal subscription of $63 per month which is a ridiculous price. Any responses well be ignored."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Hard to navigate at times."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really glad I read the reviews on this one, almost did the free trial but when something sounds too good to be true it will prove to be just that. Despite others having a good experience, reading so many recent reviews that mention payment issues & app issues after proceeding makes me so grateful for reviews. üôèüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great app , but daily routine is not the priority of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very good app to start with ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App crashes like crazy. I tried their premium features. I couldn't even access it. Requesting a refund because I cannot deal with this making me stressed. Supposed to help with my mental health but no. Don't install it. Don't give them your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to love this app given that's it's based on behavioral science but it's so confusing and frustrating to navigate. It was hell for my ADHD not helpful. They force you to do so many things, and add in goals like drinking water automatically. They also use a lot of consumer behavior science to try and manipulate you into buying immediately, like timers. It's gross. Their ADHD app - Clarify ADHD - is exactly the same. I'll leave a similar review there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoye this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I liked it for a little while and eventually the app started making my phone glitch and would interrupt me taking videos or texting and then it caused my phone to stop working altogether and would freeze. A little text bubble would pop up saying that the app wasn't optimized for my phone blah blah and I'd have to restart my phone to get it to work again. I subscribed to premium because I was talked into it but I could never really use it because of how glitchy it is. It was a waste of time tbh."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to put yourself together, try it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app to guide you through your routines:I would highly recommend it to anyone that struggles with pursuing projects they start, only to prematurely stop/be distracted along the way almost usually completely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too costly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled well within the trial period, but still received an invoice for $49.99"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üíï makes a good changes into may daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid. It asks for an initial payment after which it lets you set up personal details and then asks for further payment within minutes of verifying your identity. Then it pings you with discount offers for a service you thought you'd already paid for minutes earlier. I await a response to my email complaint to the developer. Update - no response and they've just taken ¬£35 from my account. AVOID!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's definitely helped me remember to constantly work on myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It was too much for me , maybe if I was in a higher functioning phase it could have helped. I cancelled the free trial period at least 3 days before it ended , but they still tried to charge me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ Ÿàÿ≥ŸáŸÑ ŸàŸÖÿ®ÿ≥ÿ∑ ŸàÿßŸÑŸàÿßÿ¨Ÿáÿ© ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ÿ¨ÿØÿß ŸÉŸÑ ÿ¥Ÿä ÿÆŸäÿßÿßŸÑ ŸàŸÑŸÉŸÜ ŸäŸÜŸÇÿµŸá ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Need persistance, discipline, and consistency to benefits most from the app. Only drawback with the app is overload of activities as we make progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why dont you mention in the beginning before downloading its paid membership, wasted my 20 minutes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App makes it seem like there won't be an automatic payment off your card. Thank goodness I checked before deleting the app (it's literally just a glorified to-do list). Then upon trying to cancel, it would not let me. The ""cancellation"" button does nothing- what a convenience fault for their business. And who in their right mind would pay $35 dollars for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I would normally say that this is a good app but when I open it up, it doesn't allow me to click on any options and the screen freezes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a very long time. It was great until it started charging me an extra $19.99/mo AFTER paying for the yearly subscription, on top of charging for the separate app for ADHD, I understood that monthly charge but I'm being charged and this is the 3rd time I've reached out. I've canceled the subscriptions TWICE and deleted the apps off my phone. ***And I DID email your help desk, no solution. Here we are again and I'm am still being charged. Legal action will be taken."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"particularly like the guides and how it helps me track streaks. still my first week tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Don't do it. I know it's pretty, and says all the right things, but just walk away. Just like the guy üë¶ at the run club; it promises much with no delivery nor communication."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice using it for the last 4 days If feel a bit better will see what happens in future ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You hv to sold your both kidneys before installing this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try this app, I even stupidly paid $16 just to try it out for two weeks. The app froze after the first prompt! To make matters worse fabulous is unwilling to refund me. If you try out the app I suggest paying nothing until you know it works. Don't make the same mistake as me and waste money and time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The push you need to start or the push you need to reinforce"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So positive,, The best app possible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Generally enjoy this app for getting me in a good routine and encouraging me to do positive things such as meditation & yoga. However after a few months I've found that I'm repeating the same daily/evening coaching messages which is annoying as I used to really enjoy them but seems like I might have just used up the catalogue?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its nice and easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally well done! So worth it and the right thing at the right time for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for this app on my phone then it was misplaced... I downloaded on this new phone and downloaded the app but there's no way to login... However, you guys took money for subscription for an app I've not been using... I demand a refund... And I have all evidences to prove this... This is theft for Christ's sake...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slow and beautiful. Designed with care. Slowly takes you on grip. It's working! Thank you for creating something worthwhile in this world of madness, thievery."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have to pay up front for a trial. Doesn't even say or showcase what the app does before asking for money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Felt like I'm fighting popups every time I open the app. Very busy design. First goal was to drink a glass of water for 3 days before I got a new goal. Might as well set a reminder to breathe with goals this low. Kept showing me child stories and making up letters from my future self... very weird. Requires a credit card just to start using the app. Also SPAM. This app didn't make a difference to me in 4 days and actually pushed me away from using due to all of the above, so I uninstalled it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't even get the app to even work. Freezes as soon as I open it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"100 % SCAM - AVOID AT ALL COSTS This apps free trial is a scam. They have taken repeated unauthorised payments from many individuals over the years. Their business practices are illegal and unethical."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seems like a great app but it froze on me in the same spot multiple times in the very beginning. I wasn't able to begin climbing my first mountain. Touching the screen did not take me to the next progression screen. Help?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have 3days with the app, I'm already addicted, love everything about it so far, and it truly helps with my daily routines and schedules."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seems like a mental health scheme... I fill out 15 minutes of questions and I am told I have characteristics that some add up. My first challenge is to drink water? I drink water constantly, it's not a problem for me. This really seems like snake oil. Also, everything is behind a paywall and the trial requires a commitment. You guys don't know your audience, do you?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just did not work on an Android phone, tried to explain this to customer support, no refund and no solution. I did try your Help centre and tried all the solutions and also contacted your customer support and nothing worked, the app just stayed in a continuous loop and would not work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good one , also requires subscription for extra aesthetics"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why should I pay even before I can enter the app? And where can I put MY goals? I don't care about the goals of the app like drinking water. Like, thanks I already take care of hydration. And don't tell me where to tap and I can't tap anywhere else. I don't want to tap and see what you want me to show. The app limits the user and it's full of recommendations of other apps. The constant reminder that you should pay to get better access is so annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it's a scam. once you get everything including the app, it's just a page of graphic tiles. clicking them does nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Sounded fantastic until I saw how much it was... deleted it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Used this app sometime around 2022, not only did I improve some health habits and track progress. But it has helped me track my daily productivity. The daily reminders were just perfect Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it's a great app. I really enjoy the upbeat encouragement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app might be useful for beginners, but it takes about 30 minutes to sign up. It feels like they want to get you invested before hitting you with a significant payment request. You can opt to pay a dollar, but canceling the subscription took another 10 minutes, which seemed intentionally difficult. When I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it couldn‚Äôt even restore my progress, making it a big time waste for me. Overall, I didn't gain much value from this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thoroughly enjoy this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Didn't get much further than the intro pages. Already massively put off by what seems to be more surface level ""self help"" app nonsense. The beginning quiz is one option per question when multiple could have applied, cringy little graphics. Overall a very unattractive prospect to me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A cool app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app to make me productive and making my life healthy and fit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The starting music isnt fun and too long üòñ Just 1 free week üò¢ , then need to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The resources within the categories are amazing and l am finding this app really helpful, especially with my morning routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is good, but nothing special."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware. I canceled my subscription and I was charged again. I even have promotional emails about a lower price if i came back. I canceled a second time (and took a screenshot) and now they are refusing to refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just downloaded app for the two week trial and it is not working. Leads me through the letter, then brings me to the page where it tells you to select the first ""journey"" under the ""first mountain- the foundation"", and it freezes every time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. No change. Disappointed. Cancelled subscription, which by the way, is a also little trickier than it should be. **I did follow the recommendation, and that was no help. Please fix app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I liked its experience but the only thing is that you cannot make your own habits or plan according to your need without paying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Payment doesn't go through"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this I like the little reminders of simplicity that make a huge difference... Here's to be in fabulous!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The ads for the subscription are insanely prevalent and disruptive. The tutorial process is too long for an app designed for ADHD relating people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why am i obligated to have money to be able to improve myself that's not fair in anyway you say i have the option to pay a lower price but that's still too much for me considering one dollar is 50 egp i can't afford all that just to work on my health and my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I haven't used it just yet but it looks like a colorful and cheerful encouragement to stay on track. Why am I only able to set up the account with my Google email instead of any of the other email platforms?Also, before even putting in my email, it wants to know immediately how much sleep I get each night. This seems a bit intrusive and limiting. I'm not going to delete the app just yet, but I'm hoping to get a response.You see, I flipped a coin per usual, to decide email.Leopard or Spots change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've had this app along with Clairfy, Ambiance, and Enchant for about a week and I love them. They really make me feel like I'm staying on top of things and managing my ADHD as well as better my future self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't pay for premium! From opening the app and after filling in an intro survey, I was asked to pay for a 7days trial without a chance to see if the app lived up to the promises. I decided to pick the lowest fee 89p and activate premium but the app looped into the intro survey, I reported this and was offered a 30days trial. I activate it and only went as far as three taps into the app tour before it froze. I reported this, cancelled and now been charged ¬£34.99 within days. Refund immediately!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App freezes as soon as I tap on my first adventure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"please get it but i am not sure about data sharing privacy policy. Good helpful app. üëçgreat app again get it you can add events of your life and how you felt at the time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this health app. It's mini motivating stories and activities provide great inspiration. The intuitive planner really kicks me in to gear ticking stuff off my to-do list. Fabulous really exceeds expectations with the guided exercises and meditations, prompts me to take those 1min stretches, effective 7min guided workout breaks, kicks me in to gear for 10min tidying tune ups, time for my self, setting and aligning goals, it's the healthy habit push and support network I needed to achieve more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel like I'm able to centre myself, focus myself and diligently work towards the smallest to the biggest goals that I set myself to do. Fabulous is an app that really helps people who are scatter brained to walk on the correct path"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What an irritating app. You choose explore, still, the app wants you to confirm/agree to drink water... That is NOT exploring! I wanted to explore! Delete, and luckily, I paid almost nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: DO NOT DOWNLOAD! It's a subscription TRAP! I used this app and was displeased with new versions so I unsubscribed. They took my money a year later so I unsubscribed for the second time and blocked them from future transactions. In june an email said my payment was declined. I then unsubscribed AND deleted my account completely. I'm still getting ""declined' emails. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER!!!! It might as well be labeled as a SCAM!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful, it sets remainder and also has story make it interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es excelente, me ayudado mucho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Honestly eat dirt. This company prays on those who have difficulties staying on track. When I tried to cancel my subscription it simply says to go on the website. THIS IS INTENTIONAL HOPPING YOU WILL FORGET AND THEY CAN CHARGE YOU MORE AND MORE. DISGUSTING"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. It's very hands on . And I like that Ina app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had subscribed to Fabulous yeesterday. After logging in to the android app, it shows the First mountain - The foundation screen and freezes. No keys, scroll or touch works. Sent an email to app support from Google play store. No response so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Highly motivating techniques and elements have been used in this app to make it a pleasant experience while keeping you on track with your goal. The app has become crowded over time with other app suggestions that may be beneficial to those who seek them but are a little too much for daily exposure. Besides the crowdedness, it creates a pleasant experience and I enjoy it very much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ÿßÿµŸÑÿß ÿÆŸàÿ® ŸÜÿ®ŸàÿØ ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ŸÖŸÜ ⁄ÜŸàŸÜ ÿ±ÿßÿ≠ÿ™ ŸÜÿ®ŸàÿØ Ÿà ⁄Ø€åÿ¨ ⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØŸá ÿ®ŸàÿØ €åÿßÿØÿ¢Ÿàÿ±€å ŸÜŸÖ€å⁄©ÿ±ÿØ ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá Ÿáÿß ÿ±Ÿà Ÿà ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿ∑ŸàŸÑ ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄©ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿß €åŸá ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ ÿ´ÿ®ÿ™ ⁄©ŸÜ€å."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app literally steals your money and doesn't refund it even if you cancel before the trial. Read the 1 star reviews. Stay away from this app guys!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how easy to use and it's helping my mental health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fairly helpful - only thing that confuses me is that there is no personality bits which was advertised!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice üëçüèªüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thieves much? I did not liked it so I uninstalled it. It did not appear any where as a subscription, by all about this was deleted. The surprise surprise, almost 40$ taken from my account although you did not appear on my google play list. Currently reaching out to my bank, this is legit a scam business model!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app is empty or what? installed it twice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really, truly adore this App! I have made so much progress that I never have before!! I have one complaint. I am paying the $39.99 a year, but why aren't Elixir and Lumiere included? There is no way I can afford to pay it 2x more, but I feel like I'm missing out on some great teachings. Even if it was like, buy one, get one free, it would make a big difference! BTW I am sharing this as much as possible because I truly believe in the results!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've never been able to get into the app - signed up, gave them all my info & paid üòê have never been able to start my journey üòµ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to love it but now it causes even more distractions with all those notifications! Too many adverts, and it's not intuitive anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a good friend that pulls you up, I like it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was very disappointed. I'm 16 and desperate for an app EXACTLY like Fabulous--- Without having to pay. Offering premium is fine, but the fact that you can't add more than one or two habits to your routines makes it practically useless unless you pay. At the very least, I would've hoped for more or unlimited habits without having to pay. If that were avaliable, this app would be perfect."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app, only about 2 weeks in so far. Basically gamifies small life improvements at a slow and steady pace. The coachings have been helpful I've encountered some technical glitches and there are many situations where they upsell you on additional apps or services which can be disheartening."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely outrageous. Not the app, the support. I got a ""lifetime"" deal which should mean a lifetime, right? Wrong! Another payment was taken from my account which I did not approve. I wrote to support, no reply. I thought ok, maybe it just takes longer for the refund... but now another payment has gone through, and nobody cares about my emails!! How do I stop this **** and get my refund???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I used a cracked version of fabulous (and I am deeply sorry for that). And I liked the features. I hope it will help me reach a better version of myself. Hopefully I can purchase the premium in near future. üíì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for the free version, have been charged over ¬£100 for a subscribed version I never agreed to. Complaint process basically told me to screw off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the app use it all the time but the constant interruption of 'please join premium' is very annoying there must be a better way of doing this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience. I recommend it's a great app just wish I could subscribe to it. Wish I had the money. But the free version is awesome too. Thanks for the app it really helps me in my daily life. üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amaizing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The idea is there. The motivational stuff is great but it is too cluttered and a bit shmaltzy of an app. I needed a routine planner and have adhd but it gets too far into the weeds with adhd ""tools"" and jingling keys without any option to customize them. So I felt other options were better than this app. When I decided to stop using this app just after the short trial period had ended, I got intense pushback from this developer and they pulled the TOS as a ""gotcha"". Scammy practices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This and it's affiliate apps are a scam! They make it so complicated and impossible to cancel the subscription. Tried for 3 days following their 'instructions ' and still haven't found or able to cancel. I will contact the proper authorities if they charge me a dime. And report them for this fraud!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I open it and cannot click around :/ waited a day and same issue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Loved the app, but now that I got a new phone I can't log in, it freezes, and no customer service or website to access any support. I have paid for Premium, and this very much annoys me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cool UI, but you have to pay to properly use anything üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, very positive. I do however think that the monthly payment asked is still to high. Should be about a third of this. Another example of ""what can we get away with charging, as opossed to what do we need to charge"". A very useful app though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice it help me a lot for my daily routine every day and it help me to manage my time and plans."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im just waiting for the free week over to pay for the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I like the app will update my review once I get farther along"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As someone that truly struggles with mental health on a day to day basis, I found the idea surrounding this app to be absolutely magnificent! But, did you know, a higher percentage of people that struggle with mental health issues on a day to day basis is the lower-middle class? Well, that's right where I sit, so no matter how helpful I think this app COULD be, I will never have the opportunity to try it because I cannot afford to put my mental health before my children's extracurriculars. Sad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for establishing and creating new routines and life management skills--especially for those of us with ADHD fueled OCD tendencies!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"app didn't work. never heard back from support so I cancelled my membership. regretting getting the membership in the first place after seeing these reviews ... will be keeping an eye on my bank account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beautiful but not ADHD UX friendly. The app is well designed, and the idea is great, but it isn't ADHD friendly. It is not easy to navigate, gives you more work to do instead of just helping you, and it's very confusing. It seems that to be useful, you need another app, but even still, I had Fabulous and Clarify, and they are both confusing and not straightforward nor user friendly. It need ls a lot of development, but they sell it as it was ready, and it is not. The visual graphics are great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless and not able to cancel post trial - keeps attempting to take payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The apps basic functionality is ok. I did not help me change. They try to sell there product and other apps super aggressively in the app. They also took the yearly subscription amount although I cancelled on time. At least they refunded on the same day. Be careful using the app if you are not willing to pay!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This has to be one of the most manipulative apps out there. Sure, it may help you... But good luck if you wanna cancel your subscription. They make it very hard to do so, and after you think you cancelled it, they charge you anyway. Overpriced!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App doesn't work. Can't get past opening introduction screen. Contacted tech support but no response. Cancelled subscription because I literally can't use their app. It also double subscribed me to a different app called ""Clarify"" and appeared that it was going to charge me 2 subscription fees when the trial period ended. I've since cancelled everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app interface is too complex, it's just aesthetic rather than being focus as a routine app Not worth downloading, not even for fun or productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is awesome!! I recccomend everyone to download this app! (I love it)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App freezes after clicking on first step. That's not appropriate to ask money for something that doesn't even work. EDIT: did manage to send request to Help Centre, will see where it leads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Saw this ad and thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I chose the $1 price for the trial. I cannot use the app at all. Once it asks for the login, and takes you to the page with all the mountains, the app freezes every single time. I can't click on anything and have to keep uninstalling it. Galaxy s10e"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying the routine Fabulous has helped me to create."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't subscribe in app store or using my credit card."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In three days Fabulous helped me get my life back on track, this is a fantastic resource to manage your daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for self care ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app just takes me in a loop to my email and trying to upsell and charge more. I paid 49.99 for what I thought was a membership but now the email says that was a ""plan"" but I still don't have membership. Customer service says it will take 4 days to reply üôÑ So far this all seems like a scam my rip off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to get a habit tracker on my phone because I'm trying to change some of my habits and I remember using this one like years ago. I remember why I deleted it because it's so much it just I wish it was simpler. you know it's too much to look at and I already am distracted easily so it's not. it's not for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid for subscription, but app crashes and doesn't allow me to start exploring, or even start anywhere for that matter. Waste of money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't know what I push, my card was rejected and then continued showing me things, I touched something and I ended up buying a premium plan...I need to cancel it....be careful!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"ŸÑÿß ŸäŸàÿ¨ÿØ ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible The app stole my money. It was meant to charge me $1.49 and charged me $25 do not download this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forgot about the trial, contacted the same day I was charged, but was told I could not get a refund. Haven't touched the app in months and won't use it again. Thanks for nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time or money. This is nothing you couldn't learn from any other free resource. The app is difficult to use and understand. Their customer service is nonexistent, and their promise of an easy refund if you're not satisfied is a lie."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's been months since even looked at this app and bam! They STEAL $39.99 dollars from.me!! Fabulous emailed me and said the renewal date was displayed at the time of signing up and that the subscription automatically renews. I NEVER SAW ANY INFORMATION ON THIS!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! FABULOUS APP STEALS MONEY! THE TEXT tooz SMALL! PEOPLE BEWARE!! I WANT A REFUND not info! Customer service needs improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scummy company. My online account said my subscription was cancelled, yet I was charged $40 for another app that's under their wing. Yet, there's only one website for Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The idea is good, but there are so many things you need to have the paid Premium version for. There's also always ads to get the premium version. It's overwhelming in the sense that there's so much stuff just there on the screen. I'd like to give it a better chance, but I'm not paying for the premium version. Not worth it unless you want to spend money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I hope they would also reply me. I think this app is good but i haven't tried it yet"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is meh & overpriced for what it does. It was way too cutesy for me. I could see how it might be useful to some people, but not at $160/yr. But when I was one day off in canceling and asked for a refund, the company refused even though I had not used the app after the first day. Yeah yeah yeah, it's my fault. But a company that cares about its customers will understand that money is tight and mistakes happen. Do not recommend doing business with this company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1 gave authorization for just 1 USD to explore the app now they have charges me 65 USD. Requested for refund but no reply yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've never seen such thing as an app that tries out of people's issues to make profit & money. Look at the users' reviews and then how cheap,superficial and 'rhetorical polite' the admin-team replies. I don't think that self-care and bringing routin in your life based on ""profit mentality"" lands on a good place... After admins' reply: again pointless. If you really appreciate,then first make the app free,when not,then reduce the price and also make all features available without additional cost."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"NOT Fabulous at all. Don't know why or how, definitely never signed up for this, and boom $40 charge. Bank canceled my card due to this, and have to wait a week for the card. THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY WEEKEND."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting app if you're into all that self-help self-love determination."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's amazing ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: Response says refunds in process. We'll see. Cool content but confusing design, unintuitive flow, & poor or no customer service responses/action. Once I realized how every use had confusion & basic design flaws-lack of undo, directions, logical flow (ie basic app design) I cancelled-also their sister app Shape- during their trials. I had sent multiple critical feedback & never got responses. THEY JUST KEEP CHARGING-another $60 this week! NO REFUNDS YET. TERRIBLE! AVOID!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great I think"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app freezes after the contract thing when arriving ""on the first mountain"" screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really thank the creator of this program He saved my lifeüôèü§ßüíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the app and every damn month they try to steal money from my card. I already blocked the card months ago and they would not give up. Stop trying to rob me or I will file a police report."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a scam! I donated 89p and just wanted to check the app out. They then charge you ¬£56 for a personal coach.... utter utter scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thise app is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started using the app and it's already helping me with my absent mindedness. Can't wait to see what else this app can help me achieve! :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really appreciate the effort and the plan for building such habits with a lovely community circles <333 But the thing is that sometimes people in the cirlces publish very sensitive and shaming photos so I hope you deal with. Moreover, I hope that you send daily notifications like the one you publish on social media. I was very happy so that I gave this app 5 stars but after removing the option to access premium fab by watching ads I have changed my mind :(((("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the best selfcare app, I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Warning they scam ‚ö†Ô∏è Changed my card day one on another app trial‚ö†Ô∏è Originally 4 stars. First used this app in 2017 Sadly it have become a bit tedious to use, the constant push for sharing your challanges and time gating your screen to look at animations. Only one challage at a time? Was trying to add other one and it just deleted my old one without warning. The one month subscription is made really expensive just to push you toward one year. Don't you have any trust in that your app works?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please update the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've just started using this app, so far I have learned a lot in just a couple of days. I have a really hard time with self care and self love. I'm going to stick with this app and see what happens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is subscription based app , you can't use it without a subscription no free trial , pay and use . Well I couldn't try it out so no negative rating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is really a great app. I recommend you to download this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Today is Day 3 and i can testify i am living the life of calmness already. It's worth the 5üåü only that it requires a yearly/monthly commitment which it is worth of. Be Fabulous, Use Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Moves very slowly to be sure new habits stick. Very gentle vibes. Will continue after trial period."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just got the app and it's frozen on the home page. Your help center is not user friendly at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM!! Will make unauthorized charges on your credit card. They will store your credit card event after you delete it and continue to charge. I cancelled months ago.. why are you still charging my credit card??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have only used it about a week. I like it so far, but I need to see how it works longer term. I am an absolute chaos goblin and I'm using it to try to establish routines. I can't accurately measure without using it longer though. So far I'm drinking water every morning and having a decent breakfast, so that's a win."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It has been very helpful, and I would keep it, but can't afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very inspirational and helpful. The easy daily reminders keep you on point! I wish I could give 10 Stars!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good but how to process the way unknown person me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its a great app.. app range. I vote 4 star because.. The cross selling of apps annoys me. Thats all you get prompts for is to buy another app. I've got a few and all are similar in style and content, just different images. The fabulous app would be awesome if users could progress at their pace. I feel I'm going to get bored, not being able to focus on other features other than routine. It is good but could be better and not so sales-orientated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App doesn't move off the screen with the foundation and the percentages completed. Please fix the bug. I need this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Throws you through a confusing start up questionnaire basically forcing you to subscribe with money. Then throws you through more confusing process just to find out how much it'll cost you after your trial. Too expensive and a waste of time. Seems they only care about money and not your well being"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of my best app it's very useful and adds alot of valse in my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Collects a ton of data before letting you know it will charge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cannot get through to customer service to change my email address"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how easy it is to set up new habits. The app's interface is clean and intuitive, making it a breeze to track my progress. The daily reminders are a lifesaver, ensuring I stay on top of my goals. Plus, the ability to customize the frequency and time of reminders is a fantastic touch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammy! I downloaded the app after an Instagram ad and paid the entry price. After paying this I had a seven day trial before my 40‚Ç¨ subscription should start. The app froze after the first log-in and even reinstalling did not make it work. I paid the entry price for nothing. Cancelled my trial in their website, no confirmation mail. Thus, checked my PayPal and the subscription (I never asked choose for) was still active."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using the pro version for just over a month now, and I've found it's been beneficial to my habit building, and enhances my daily life overall!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a good place to stay motivated. I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly am excited and believe I can get over whatever is causing serious anxiety and depression so badly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Would give 6/5 stars if it let me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly didn't expect to like this app so much... but was having a day when I came across an ad for it and decided to take advantage of the trial. It's not the kind of cheesy, disconnected, unrealistic fluff I kind of expected, but touching and gently uplifting and sweet. The voice is charming, and the whimsy of the ""traveler"" on a journey is perfect...again, actually doesn't feel cheesy ;) I love creating personalized habit lists, getting reminders, and the satisfaction of checking them off"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not bad. It's still early to tell. I have been using it for a week, and I haven't been following the routine exactly... Also, I'm using it on it's free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The proof is in the pudding, or title of this app rather! Truly Fabulous! I love the look and feel of this user friendly app The content is high quality, cohesive, and interactive. Also enjoy the pace which is steady and focused, unlike the information overload as I've experienced with other apps. Meditating to the morning and evening messages (and learning to execute implementation intention as well as steps to welcome my emotions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is incredible app for growing such a good habits formation day by day, And it's effective also. Anyone who is struggling with schedule problem they will definitely have to visit this app once. Thankyou team Fabulous. You're made really a Fabulous app üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try this app, but after doing the very first steps it just breaks and it becomes unresponsive (the app keeps running, but no matter what I do, the screen doesn't register when I touch it). Conceptually it seems to be a good app, but it does not work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Hi, I had problems entering the first step, the application remains static and there is no way for it to react, there are many lessons that I would like to try but I can't enter any of them, how could I solve it?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app makes you 'sign a contract' that you 'will not live forever' and gives you no other options. Hahaha not disturbing or upsetting at all. Can't imagine anyone who might be triggered by this. The very next thing it does is ask you for money. After paying it asks me to connect my google account, which I did not want to do, I prefer to log into things separately for security for security reasons. There were no other login options though, so I guess I paid for a trial for nothing. Cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ü•±"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless and pathetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app so far. I would recommend this to my friends and family"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Overall function of app is good. The company on the other hand is not one I will continue business with. They do not give 24hrs notice before pulling balances from account, most companies have resorted to this in hopes people are not paying attention and keep paying for something they are not using. I opted for have self care alerts, they became duplicates before the trial was over. They first were going to deny my refund because I didn't cancel soon enough but quickly followed with a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is really encouraging and will eventually change your habit to the one you wanted. You won't regret using Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pay to use app!!! No free version!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good routine planning app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle and insightful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing üíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Filled out my information and started the trial, now the app freezes Everytime I try to start the first journey Developers replied with an answer that does not help at all. App does not work at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"In april I was sure I had cancelled but for some reason the cancelation request did not go through and I was charged .When I emailed I was told nothing could be done and wasn't eligible for a refund. I emailed multiple times and was disregarded completely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Atleast u will be stick up with your Target, unlikes other apps those do not emphasize that much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ineffective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I only have one significant criticism so far and that it's either not possible or not obvious how to add a custom habit to a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My biggest problem with this app is that you don't have any video that helps you use the app features properly that is why I stop using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever... üí´"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent practices. They hide the unsubscribe and make the process almost impossible. I canceled my free trial and uninstalled it within minutes of installing. Also, after going back through, I never actually activated my account through the email that they sent. They charged my card $39.99 from a Paris location, and my bank flagged it. My card has now been frozen. üôÑüòí Have some integrity and transparency in your business practices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app does not allow much flexibility in how you use it and how to make it useful to you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really something very special to realize my dreams. My first step towards destination and accomplishment. I can go very easily with my routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is just what you need. üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too complicated, not intuitive. I found the science pieces interesting, but the felt more like I was lost in maze and accidentally saying ""yes I did this action"" because it prompted me to, but I hadn't actually done that action/habit. Visually busy interface makes the app more likely to be a time sucker than actually being helpful. Feels more meditation energy style rather than concrete action focused."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been enjoying the app. I really appreciate that the techniques are backed by research. I have one complaint. Periodically, the app shows little graphics with tips and offers you a button to save the image. But when I try to save it, it just sends a link to the Fabulous app without the image. I hope it's a mistake, but it feels crummy that I try to share or save a picture with self care tips, but end up just linking the app. Why would you offer to save the image if it doesn't actually work?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a month and this app is all good vibes. Easy to make routine, still checking on effectiveness and might come back for review on this later. Love the background sound it plays during my morning routine!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got this app and thought it was amazing and really helpful until I got my new phone signed in and realized my subscription that I paid for never transfered over I've contacted them TWICE over the last month or so no responses don't get this app apparently they will just take your money and never respond to the point you now have to make a review this app is meant to help people and even has an option for people who don't have the money which is despicable that you just take the money and leave"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm getting more done and stressing less with this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"just one word to define this app , FABULOUS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE. Somehow paid for a year of the app and immediately emailed to ask for a refund. I am certain I never signed up to it and they just took the money! They just ignored me and never responded so terrible customer service. Don't download this app. Update: after reading others reviews it seems that it is not only me who has been charged fraudulently. In response to the developers - as stated above, I have already emailed and was ignored. EDIT 23/07 still no reply on emails sent 6 months ago"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very helpful. Take your time. Don't rush your progress. Trust and allow the experts guide you. If you do this. It is life changing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sorry my English is so bad. - Advantage: Really change yourself. I am no longer lost. I didn't know how to create a habit until I used this app. - Defect: Almost no. - The best thing I like: Everyone's shared posts and daily commitments, words of encouragement. How wonderful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you sign up to this app, make sure you cancel the subscription in Google Play or it automatically renews without an email etc. I've not used the app for months and have found myself with another years subscription which I won't use, and the T&Cs say I can't apply for a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for being mindful of things we consume, how we act, the way we think about stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous like the name says!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üòåwhat can I say"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lots of love for this app. Eversince I started using it, I have a very positive view towards life. Its been weeks now and I feel so much healthier because the app made me start drinking water every morning, exercise and do a few other things of self love and care. It also encourages replacing bad habits, like porn, drugs, procrastination etc with good ones rather than just attempting to get rid of them just like that. Man, I wish I could say more about this app. Thank you so much for making it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interactive and gamifying to do list thingy üòÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far this app has been great I just started using it but I must say I'm impressed so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app, but it will be more interesting if they can add timing record."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really, really love this app, and the only reason I feel compelled to give 3 stars instead of 5 is that it's quite frustrating to have all progress reset when switching to a new device. Apparently premium accounts have account-binding, and I think this feature should be either for all accounts, or at least it should inform new users about the lack of it. Now having completed multiple journeys, I will need to restart. If a solution exists, I don't know what that is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very poor customer service. They market this app towards people who have ADHD, who are forgetful already, and need help in building routine. Yet have NO compassion should you forget to cancel your trial. I started a trial, and forgot to cancel, and was charged $54.99. This is a very extravagant amount for any app. You will find no help in getting a refund, even if you contact them immediately upon seeing a charge. They make canceling the app difficult. I feel preyed upon. BEWARE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super good app üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately I was charged $16 for the free trial and requested the funds back on the same day I signed up. They said I will not receive a refund. Customer service isn't friendly, the trial option is misleading, and the app starts with very basic tasks that aren't customizable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Impractical"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As someone who was actually diagnosed, this app was helpful but not really the stuff I actually need help with I have to pay for. And in this economy I can't afford that not to mention you tried to charge my PayPal for a free week trial. So it's a hard pass after that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I don't have words it is faboulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Can you please add dark mode? i hate bright backgrounds it hurt my eyes. i can't even use the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's impossible to cancel. The worst."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am using this app for almost 1 week now. This app changed my routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is great but I am annoyed by the ads they show about other money demanding apps they have made."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has been a life changer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The daily coah messages are amazing...it helps me mind to open up more. amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I want this but I want the monthly subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Now that's #the BEST APP out there to manage&take your life to the NEXT LEVEL, thrive&be happy..!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very effective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it and helps me keep up to my daily habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App was useful for a couple of weeks. Eventually I stopped using it and thought I cancelled my subscription. However they bill you annually and give you no notice whatsoever that the money is coming out. When you complain they claim they have no record of your cancellation and force you to pay for the year anyway. Very poor customer service and clearly they just want to make money off recurring subscriptions that people forget about"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have ADHD and I used to have no morning routine. Using this app has been the best, most consistent way to actually eat breakfast daily and build some routines, not just in the morning but overall. It's really helpful, and I love how I can classify my reminders by sections based on the time of day. I have found it awesome. 5 stars!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this ...it really helps me get thru the day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have a fantastic experience with fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The encouragement is helping me to stick with itüòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app and their ADHD one. The subscription process is so confusing. I signed up for the free trial but was still charged $14. After a few weeks of not being into it I cancelled through their website. I have a confirmation email that says I'm good but I've since been charged $45 the last two months even though I reach out each time to confirm i cancelled. Luckily my bank blocks the charges but customer service sucks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive supportive. Baby steps at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have paid for annual subscription last month.üò° But still not activated.üò° I raised query 3 times they are not responding üò° I want my money back üò°"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and affective to"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it thisApps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This is a good app but only for paid user those who are using this app free version they have very limited source like really the resources for free user"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun app with lots to read and journal about! Get ready to dig deep ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tiny steps, really work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"everything great, very helpful app. I'd like to get some newer daily coaching materials though. After almost a year i started to hear the same ones frequently What i like about the app is the built-in coaching records, excercise and meditation materials. What i don't like is the invite friends box that constantly takes up space on the top of the app. i have already mentioned my friends who might appreciate the app. After some time the box should go to a more hidden tab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very disappointed. Ipaid for the premium subscription and inahve raised multiple queries and requests to the support team and received not a single response from them I am also unable to delete the subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An absolutely beautiful app to guide you through your journey towards a healthier and disciplined lifestyle. The paid service is totally worth it. As it'll make invaluable changes to your life, if you are persistent. Must try!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Life changing app habits maker best and best app . This app is very powerful. When you focus and be disciplined. Thanks üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"seen so many ads of this app i installed just to leave a bad review"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM!!!! Update: Spoke to customer service or rather, got the emails that did not address anything directly related to this account. Then they tried to charge the full price over and over. Till i cancelled the card!! Could never login at all during paid trial. Can't login to cancel, charged my card repeatedly and did not return 11$ that they know they owe me!! FRAUD...HORRIBLE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really cute app, Seeing changes in me already a solid 10/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love every app they offer helps alot especially when you feel overwhelmed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very efficient"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I really like it I just wish that it didn't cost money because I don't have enough money for this kind of thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Signed up for a trial period, can't use app at all. Customer service has not helped."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is my second year being charged for this app despite multiple attempts to cancel my subscription. They are stealing money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it so far, but took the premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been struggling with my mental health for a while, and other apps don't really have what I'm looking for. My husband introduced me to Fabulous and I'm happy to say that it actually works! It starts with small prompts then grows over time so your brain has time to actually adjust to your new routine. Safe to say I won't be deleting this app any time soon. (Also if you want to pay for the premium it's only $3.00)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"An amazing app to get yourself collected. But yeah, only if you have the strong willpower to keep doing the things regularly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app, but change the monetisation model for Nigeria, it sucks. Look at what Spotify and Duo Lingo has done for us here and how cheap it is. Don't make it a yearly thing, make it monthly and I'd most likely subscribe. Don't be greedy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never got past the intro video. Hot tip! Skip the first offer and you'll get a better offer with a free trial. Uninstalling now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its slow going, confusing, no guidance and just tasks, no motivation. It won't let me cancel the free trial, now they're just drafting out the fees for the month. Says I must go through Google play subscriptions but then Google shows I have no active subscriptions. Tried to use the website and it tell me that I have a subscription and how much it is but that I have to use Google play. Just cancel this before I dispute the charge please."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Somehow tricked me into subscribing into an in app purchase.. was charged $55 this morning even though I cancelled my free trial in june!! Careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Simple and powerful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Attention this is a subscription scam!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"There was an issue with the subscription going off when I cancelled. But I got a refund after contacting them. If you cancel, then please make sure it is cancelled because there's multiple pages where you have to say yes before it's cancelled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fabulous really üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Starts strong and immersion, but then becomes as predatory as a mobile game, confusing with lot's of systems and options, while only focusing on drinking water. If it wasn't from a respected establishment I would have thoughts it some kind of scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! I absolutely love it . It helps us builds habits that later on become our lifestyle and it also doesn't rush you into the process rather it takes everything slow and makes it easy for the user to build new habits and slowly get out of their comfort zone ,it helps you break your streak of prcastination and helps you become a better version of yourself by letting go of the past you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I liked what you were trying to do but the fact that you took over my default alarm shortcut in my quick actions pull down screen and wouldn't let me turn it off was too much. Uninstalled that after trying to figure out where I could turn that setting off after 10 minutes to no luck."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I started on the free trial and ended up paying for a subscription. Helps keep the mindset in a positive way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I recommend it. Maybe it's buggy, may I am maybe my phone is... I have the other apps as well and my life is much better for it. Also, they frequently ask for my feedback and suggestions. Please stop with the negativity. I know things can be frustrating but take a deep breath."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app just the best of you need a change in your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Engaging and creating meaningful change with small steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over a month now. I really like that it doesn't force you to build habits quickly; it helps you build them slowly. I feel a bit happier doing small things daily, which I thought weren't so important to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful for habit tracker"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A gentle daily assist with my insane ADHD - it's helping me get into a healthy and positive routine by buidling manageable daily blocks of time, adding elements slowly as I build my structure. The app includes meditations, music, exercises, and more. Each aspect is brief, positive and simple to achieve, and it's been easy to fit into my already packed day. A very positive experience so far!!! üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good particularly to slow me down from jumping around tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal... ... One word ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually one of the better apps in terms of mental health and overall physical wellness. They're not greedy with the users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It was fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not many features are free . Most of the features you will have to pay for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That's EXACTLY what I've been searching for! This app helps making up new habits, keeping everything organized and gives a small ounce of positivity and motivation! At first it may seem like something's wrong, but give it a try - at least a few days! By the way, I have downloaded 4 out of all your apps, and I'm loving every of them! I'll probably download more though :3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not for me. The app tries to passive-aggressively convince you to do things like activating notifications by saying that if you don't, you won't progress. Having been guilted into activating them, said notifications ignored the Do Not Disturb mode on my Android and vibrated while I was sleeping. This woke me up when I really needed to sleep, which made me considerably less healthy and less productive than I would otherwise have been."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been awesome to use and help me stay on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Paid app üëé"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app everyone can try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It would've definitely helped me, but before they could gave me a Morning routine that would be good for me, they told me I need to have premium for it. I deleted the app now, 'cause I just don't have the money for it. there are people out there who just don't have the money for it no matter how cheap it is. I'm searching for good apps who are completely free even if they had ads, I would use it. Sadly, thats not one of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The idea is marvelous.. I'm just a bit disturbed with all the other apps they keep suggesting, even if I already have the premium account and those apps aren't included in this one.. so.. ü§î‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ú®‚ÄºÔ∏è¬ÆÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful. Keeps me on track."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"UPDATE 9.7.2024. After a short break of cca 2 years I've again paid for the 1-year subscription and I never regretted it so far. Fabulous just keeps on evolving and developing and I'm happy to be able to watch the progress. I'd love a bit more guided yoga or pilates content sometime in the future üòâ UPDATE 30.8.2021.

Grateful that those like me in Nigeria who might not afford a premium app like this, still have some access, Hence I'm an FDR evangelist sharing, sharing. 07/24. Can't believe I'm getting this much value in an app. I'm still struggling but the graphics are so whimsical they lift my mood. It's like an alternate universe. First review I've given for any app in a while I really love the app and I love that even the free version doesn't feel to restrictive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It does not what the present in their add .it is jis a reminder for drinking water for 3 - 4 times a day . And nothing more in this app . So please don't download it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using for a little while but quite the helper."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Over designed, lacks routine editting, fake corporate positivity, and ads that try to pressure you into buying their subscription. it can't even add a custom routine, useless."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well worth the money. Keep in mind it's just a app you still have to do the hard work.very easy to use. Just wish I could link it to my Alexa so the rutens ar pre set so I have a double reminder. Don't mind manually putting it on Alexa but it just adds a bit of strain with my ADHD even tho it's a tiny thing. Sometimes it taks one small extra task to throw me off . I can do it and I he encouragement from this app is helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hello I have a question about this app. Now does it really have too pay for a app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible! I thought it was a cute app yo make cute to do lists and all like shown in the picture. Nope! It's an app that treats you like a 10-year old reminding you to drink water when you wake up. Unistalled immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this. I like that I have a routine that follows me as go through it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the gentle guidence"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS A SCAM AND 100% NOT WORTH IT. ITS A MONEY GRAB AND THAT IS ALL. SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are many other apps that are worth investing into and that actually care about customer satisfaction. This one needs to take responsibility for producing garbage and having horrible customer service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DOA. Can't get the app to run. I tap on ""An Unexpected Journey"" and nothing happens. Can't interact with anything."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"On day three and enjoying it immensely so far. It has a lovely vibe and has been very helpful for me in regards to motivation which I often struggle with. Only one irritating thing, even though I have downloaded some of the sister apps which are relevant for me, I'm still seeing in app adverts for them. It takes away from the tranquility and feels too much like a pushy salesman."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for tracking all the daily activities"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid for premium and it's not working. I would like a refund or my account upgraded to what I paid for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am a premiun user and loving this app but i am finding a small issue. I mistakenly cancel the daily audio and i am not getting it now.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very beautiful, full of philosophy that makes u think about your choices everyday and the impacts it creats"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's a great motivator and easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is the problem with these apps, before even showing what they can do for you, they already ask you for money. Not that great of an idea, you see developers!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware: I was looking forward to exploring what the app had to offer, unfortunately it froze and would not respond, even after reinstalling. I asked for a refund only to have customer service inform me that the initial fee is non-refundable. I hope you enjoy the $16 (suggested by the app to help offset costs for other users) that I got absolutely nothing from."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me in terms of manifestation"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interesting app at the beginning, very helpful when things don't present themsevels as you wished and you feel that you are starting to slide on the emotional path. It has beautiful stories to guide you on your journey, daily routine planner, and communities where you can share thoughts and feelings with."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,". TRASH DEVELOPERS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A tool I never thought I needed. But at the moment, I cannot do without."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It it's totally free, then it would be good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do you need my email before I explore the app? It's just too much. I started, and there was an intense quiz. I'm all for it, but let me see what the app is and what it has to offer before asking emails and quizzing me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Simply a waste app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great guide to help in self improvement journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'd love to try it. Perhaps you could remove the fingerprint-to-commit things. Feels somehow. We downloaded the app cos we want you to help , we should be able to commit without putting our fingerprint on everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me a great deal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscribed for trail but doesn't show when it will end and when a hefty subscription will start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!! For people like me who need to keep a proper track of progress and trying out different hobbies and challenges, this is the best app üíû Thank you so much fabulous üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Usually I don't get along with these things. I forget about them usually or they expect things I can't relate to or I am ashamed I can't or don't want too do them. But this is sensible, understandable, simple (but not patronising). The animations are lovely, the voice is lovely. The simplicity of the setting up the glass of water, has got me thinking about other things I can set up to inspire me to get it done. This approach also takes another step out of otherwise overwhelming jobs. X"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a pretty amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The fabulous are amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far it's really enlightening and helps focus my thoughts more on my daily goals and less on the bigger more daunting goals, making them appear smaller makes it less intimidating and therefore easier to actually accomplish them. I've only just begun but I'm already hooked on the excitement of improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Expensive. Of course we'd all like to improve our lives but not all of us can afford the $4.50 per week, that you neglect to mention until the app is insralled and has already found room in someones heart. I understand tho. Have to get paid, obviously. Just that those of us that can't afford to improve out lives will have to make do without. Funny how everything aimed at improving ones situation in life nowadays costs quite a lot of money. Almost like some are to never improve or better. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is my first experience, and I‚Äôm satisfy about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Bro fabulous has been great I just would love it more if it was free or just cheaper but it doesn't look lik it will but it great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's really helpful I feel supported"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I want to stay secure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Encourages healthy habits every day. Highly recommended! üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you, I'm grateful I found this app, it's just I can't afford it's paid version at this stage of my life...wish me luck so that I will be able to earn. And literally this fabulous is FABULOUS. ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Looks pretty but completely useless. No Google play trophies."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't find the app useful enough to invest any money into it. While trying to cancel before the trial was up, the process is a headache and takes you in loops. Very frustrating and fraudulent. I'm happy I never gave this company a dime."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very nice app with a good UI"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do you keep subscription if you want to make change in people's life.... You can run adds through your app and monetize it, this way all the people who can't even afford paying like kids can enjoy your service and you can keep subscription to remove adds. Directly stoping customer through subscription of service is a limitation of your app usage by yourselfs... if you want to increase app usage for customers please remove the subscription. Not everyone can afford it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Decent, but when building new habits, it is very counterproductive that you get new ones all the time without having really done the one before. E.g. exercise, do it 3 times this week to succeed. First of all, 3 times is far too low to build a habit and second, it just tracks the 3 times. No matter how many times you didn't do it. Then it pretends you actually succeeded and wants you to add another habit. They talk about time and taking it slow, but rush everything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's paid but worth it too . So enjoy it accordingly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware! The app hides the option to cancel your subscription, and I haven't heard back from their support even after I wrote to them the day after I installed the app asking for the ""free"" subscription to be cancelled. I got charged $26 at the end of the trial even though I never used the app. There's no option on the app or their website to actually cancel the subscription or get a refund. Extremely scammy behaviour and I'm still trying to get a refund! Not cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The application is meant to make you productive. But the setup of this app takes forever. And i felt they're asking too much information as a routine planner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really has changed my routine recommended for students Thanks to fabulous ‚òÜ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's damn good guys try it i recommend it all of you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's such an amazing app that I have ever come across. It has helped me become more focused and build health daily routines that will assure me of a better tomorrow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was working fine with my pixel, but when I installed it in my other phone, it stopped working at the explore screen and I've already paid for premium. How do I make it work on my new phone?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"To really helpful app and I really think it's helping me to improve myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amezing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellently put together, I love the app the most sweet thing about fabulous is the no adds in free mood. Don't think further just get it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Omg this is the most cute and useful app I ever had ‚ù§Ô∏èdefinitely deserves 5 üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to get a refund and cancel this app for 3 years. First year when I accidentally didnt cancel after the 7 day period I let it go. 2nd year I reached out because I forgot I had it, a few days after I realized I was charged and they told me they could not find my account (I had never actually logged into the app ever, I had only paid for it after seeing an ad). So they needed more info and my ADHD self forgot that they needed even more info. 3rd time I've been emailing, spoke wit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app so complex and asking for subscription from the start, I'm a student lol, and asking for that 1 year advance payment is a big NO!. Most things inside premium wall. I will prefer Lifeup pro than this -_-. I'm uninstalling it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabuloso!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"-Freemium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great but paid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was excited to try this app for 7 days, unfortunately bc of money issues i had to cancel before 7 day trial. I looked at my bank account today and was charged 40 bucks. This put my money negative in my account. How do i cancel these payments? I need help !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app wants you to subscribe at the very beginning, without giving you a chance to test it. And as I've read other comments I realized it is almost impossible to unsubscribe... So I deleted it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So confusing. Don't get it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cant get past the sign up cos its asking me to press n hold a button I can't scroll Down to do it and help centre didn't reply"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever if you stick to it for a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to define important routine building habits, starting small and building up. I am enjoying this app. I overdid it the first time and had to pair it down to just a couple things every morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wish not so much had to be paid for. Like I'm a kid I can't pay for this anyway, but it still helps a lot anyway"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"trash"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nyc app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in my trial week right now, and the app seems to be one of the best routine planners I've used so far. Good stuff!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It was ok, until I got charged for a months subscription only to be told I don't have one right after."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helps with forming new habits, although I would advice you study the app first to really know how to use it. Once you do that it really helps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have had an amount of 34.99 come out of my account t and I don't have your app or a subscription in place ??? Can you explain why before I go to my bank and report"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very best app in world"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"While yhe experience was a good one I unfortunately couldn't afford it and so I cancelled my services. Somehow the money still got deducted from my account and now I am chasing for a refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent, but there is room for improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use, more than enough features in the free version. Simple goals to become better step-by-step. The UI is beautiful, but a bit cluttered and some motivational texts that pop-up after completing certain things run on a bit too long for my taste. All in all, a very unintrussive addition to your day that helps in the long run!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could give a zero, I would. Trying to cancel subscription and they make it soooo difficult! Cancelled twice and still shows an active subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE! I installed the app on google play, never opened it, never created a username, wasn't inclined to use it just installed to look into it later since you can't ""favorite"" apps on google play. 2 months later I Happen to see a $45 charge on my card from them. I begged for $ back from both google and them and I was refused. This is Terrible business practice. Very deceptive. I wonder what huge portion of their income they're making from people unknowingly giving them $45 annually."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelente!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wish more features were provided, like daily coaching, without getting a subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been struggling with habits, but it's like this helps me with procrastination and the gameplay is entertaining. It makes me want to be productive, and it doesn't make me feel guilty for taking smaller steps. I don't usually rate apps 5 stars, but this was an exception! Well done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Edit 2023-08-02 Fabulous is still a great app, every time it asks me to rate again. : ) Original: a little after 2023-02-17 This app has helped to bring hope that I can get over my struggles with depression & executive-function problems. I just started the healthy-breakfast part after the morning water, & I joined a morning-walk challenge. I'm looking forward to more help getting into the habits I've been struggling to get back into. The app can be somewhat corny, but that is part of its charm."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a wholesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You go through the wizard leave them your email and get welcomed by the paywall. No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful, very useful as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actualiselo a menudo es una gran aplicaci√≥n"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After taking all personal and in depth information they are offering paid service. Will recommend not to install this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately these apps charge you without your permission"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps form good routines for yourself. You just have to be winning to follow through and be honest with yourself about your starting point. The app is really easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Slightly expensive but works better for me üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing and I'm impressed with the quality of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont sign up for premium. They make it difficult to cancel and won't give a refund even if the charge just processed. App itself is very busy amd annoying. Edited to respond to their response. Your care team reminded me that I was told it would auto renew and will NOT refund. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to manage and control your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Why no monthly payment. ? I don't want yearly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrendous. Only seems to ask me to drink water, which everyone needs to for survival. I then went to cancel a premium trial and it has a number of traps designed to trick vulnerable people into staying and paying. Stick to reading Atomic Habits: there's no BS involved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app is amazing it has really helped me develop healthy habits and routine. so excited to continue on this journey and become a more organized self loving person!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I personally hate how we need premium for everything,I was hyped about the morning routine and it's premium,no change at all 1 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's almost impossible to cancel their subscription, it's quite invasive and it feels disrespectful to make artificially so hard, especially for an app supposedly dedicated to care and self-development. You can't cancel through the app, they say to go to the website. There, you've to write an email. Then they say you need to read an article. Then they get you so confused you don't even know how to proceed. I feel scammed. Also, it's just a bunch of reminders, partially on things you never asked."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Are you looking to help yourself, and on a budget? Look no further, this is the app for you! You will be reminded you don't have enough money for rapid growth, if you don't pay the Fabulous piper PAYWALL!! If that's not enough for you, and your goal to improve your life, make more money being a productive member of society? The bottom of Fabulous joke app, a bunch of different pay wall app$ in the name of ivey league research are there for you to buy!$ADHD? Diet? Healing your inner child? Bleh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful especially if you struggle with motivation, procrastination, completing tasks, etc...it helps and stays on top of things by helping to set up a routine, alarms, meditation, and other things! It's going to help me with all the thing I struggle with on a daily basis!! Thanks for a great app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Bombards you with ads for premium. Also preys on people with memory problems as they expect you to forget about your trial!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"8.50 per month for what I already have set up with alarms that I ignore. I have ADHD, I should be your target audience but the minute I saw ""free trial"" I had to investigate. It is very very hard to find the monthly pay option, they try really hard to make you sign up to annual after a 7 day trial. if you're ADHD like me, stay away from companies that try to rip you off like this. Either you won't notice the direct debit or it'll ruin your day"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app deserves a zero star. I was charged $16.41 while attempting 2 weeks trial of the app. Whereas the app clearly quoted in N1200 Naira per month which is less than $1 per month. I was charged $16.41 which should be more than enough for annual subscription but rather they charged me $16.41 just for 2 weeks trial. I know the only way to block them from charging my virtual card futher based in reviews I've seen so far will be to freeze the card. The people behind this app have no soul."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"To be sincere I did not really know what to expect when I joined but this app has helped me very much. The timely updates and encouragement are just what I need to get through each day. Thank you very much and keep up the good work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst experience with Google Play apps ever. I downloaded app and it charged money for the subscription, after which I wanted to refund. I wrote to support and they promised to refund in 10 business days I waited, but don't get my money. I wrote again and get new answer that there is transaction problem. In result I did not receive refund for a month, although I wrote to support, but the only thing I received in response was that we had problems with your transaction, wait another 10 days!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A bunch of sly thieves who charge your card even after you cancel their subscription. Update: I talked to the support and I stand by my review. Users, pay attention! If you don't cancel your subscription 24 hours before its renewal date, they'll keep trying to charge your card, even if you cancel it afterwards (ref Article 7.2 in T&Cs). They kept hounding my card after I had manually cancelled the subscription from their website. What a joke! You bunch will get what you deserve, don't worry!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy to get this app this not just a app it gave good goals to achieve. this app will gave me to realise the achieve and inspiration"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the most helpful app I think I've ever downloaded. I use it every day and it has really helped me heal my inner parent and support/encourage myself in a whole new level. No more shaming myself for when I slip up, but instead I encourage myself to continue on my goals, which helps me achieve them! It's taken the dread out of goals and self-care and has filled me with optimism and a feeling of things being possible, of competence, and of gentle self compassion. Try Lumiere also!! Lovely!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app helping change my behaviours"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great app for life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't been using the Fabulous App very long, but I'm seriously considering paying the subscription for the year. It's been brilliant for keeping track of what I need to do, and what I've done. It's motivating me to create better habits and be much more productive with my time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It has a free version. As a 15 years old. I am using this because I have no money. But sometimes It would be better if I could use premium version. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still working with it, liking it so far. Will add the other star in a month. I dropped it and now 2024 I. Taking it again; I think I put too much in my routines and that is why it was so long and hard to keep up. If it is designed for people with ADHD, it needs to be simpler. I love the multiple options and the music."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to follow and build habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my free subscription but i got charged . I need my refund asap ICICI Bank Acc XX855 is debited with Rs. 1,699.00 on 17-Jun-24 MSI*GOOGLEPLA."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I bought premium 2022 through Google Play but then cancelled as app was too complicated, and thought that was the end of it. However this morning I have been charged! I tried going through their useless contact us chatbot, and found out my digging around that they had switched my subscription details from being on Google Play to their own website. So of course I wouldn't see that I was still subscribed with them. Update 2024: they have taken out my funds again a year later!!! Absolute scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an app that I would be able to use and feel like I wasn't sitting wasting my day away and gaining nothing... I need something to help me with my productivity and keeping me accountable for things I was letting slip by with excuses is made to feel better about not getting them done. This app has been so much more than I could have thought it's amazing and the things you gain from it are things you will use for you entire life. I'm so thankful I've found it. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice concept, uses proven methods, but feels a lot like a scam trying to squeeze cash out of people who struggle."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best app for you if you're having a psychological functional freeze üòÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Complete waste of time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Thia app is great. Very positive and inspiring. But there is still an ad that plays even though I'm paying for the app. After every success it ""awards"" me with 5 free trials to gift out. Which kinda ruins the nice compliment it gives with ""car salesman"" vibes. It's everywhere in the app as well. Like a popup on the home page. Kind of ridiculous for a payed app. Still a good app to help one better themselves and get into good habits though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First day, so far so good."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"L o ve this app So much wherever wakeup I straightly go to this Upp"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the app within 24hrs and was still billed for the year, and they refused to refund. Shady app. DO NOT USE THIS APP. It's a SCAM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BUYER BEWARE: Dark patterns! I cancelled my membership before the 14 days were up. They charged me anyway. I asked for a refund and they asked for proof that I cancelled, like with a cancellation email from them. They never sent an email about my cancellation. I tried to cancel again. Still, no email. Their cancellation process is what's called ""dark patterns."" It's a trap! For the person responding with ""Sorry..."". Just skip it and tell me when you all will refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's so money hungry now compared to when I last used it. Had to say no to premium on 4 different pages consecutively. The app also doesn't give you the option to delete your account and data. Leads you on with so many annoying ads for premium. I don't think it's helpful anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just starting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good when get used to it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing life changer app üòçüå±"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app is really, really useful and an amazing tool to try to help quiet the noise in my brain. Unfortunately, I cannot afford it. If it were a monthly subscription of like $5, I could handle that, but right now I cannot afford to pay for the full year up front. So, that's my only real complaint."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This product makes it difficult to cancel because you it seems you will lose your membership. If you don't want to renew at the end of the year you can pause it, but that's not what I wanted and I got billed again even though I wasn't using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A few days in and its been really easy to use, not too pushy and quite motivating. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish you would just tell me ahead of time that it is a subscription and how much it costs. I just want a free app to create a daily plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"would like to be able to make more routines from the beginning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love the content on this app. I was feeling very hopeful. But the paywall is so high, it's just not something I can afford. I understand the need for help with upkeeping an app like this, but it continues to be out of my budget. I wish I could access it but I'm glad it can help anyone who CAN afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I asked for it, they did it. I fell like the UI is a little better now. Besides, I think I finally understood what the app is made for. It is not meant for literal routines planning, but it is more focused on slowly developing habits on the user, which I think is very useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is solid so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Well it seems like a nice program at the start and then we have some sort of contract and I'm supposed to put my fingerprint in totally freezes my screen totally useless now to me so I'm going to uninstall you and basically walk away that's really sad clearly you're an Apple program not an Android program and though I have the probably the nicest Android you can buy your program doesn't work with me oh well..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very insightful and inspirational. Update 6-11-2024, This app hasn't given up on me, it continues to keep helping me even when times are tough."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its a wonderful app that helps me overcome the stress and anxiety I face on a daily bases. The only issue I have is that I can't access all because most of the features is paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful coaching for each day. Not overwhelming. Very pleasant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Incredibly helpful app, but it's very expensive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice experience üòÑüòÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app!!ü§åüèªüíóüéÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this for more then a week it's a really good app for making a routine and keeping track of your progress in personal growth. It is sometimes a little cheesy but it's good. So far I have been enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like it, but would appreciate if it was a little less new-age in the art aspect."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great app but they continue charging even when you cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It won't take payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just FABULOUSLY! I wish it has home screen widgets though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Content is fantastic. Interface is beautiful but also kinda slow. Often have to tap multiple times to get it to acknowledge an activity completion. Takes lots of taps to update my routines. Not sure why some activities have timers because timers don't seem to do anything. Fewer animations and artistic transitions and instead a little more responsiveness and intuitiveness would make for a more enjoyable experience. UPDATE: The app just killed my streak progress after 100 days üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app after watching an ad. I had to subscribe to log in, and I read that I had 7 days to cancel before I was charged. I tried the app features and was not satisfied. I canceled the subscription within the hour believing the app would not charge me. It keeps telling me to drink water and sends dumb inspiring messages. You wont get a refund. dont even download the app. The worst experience ever!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is keeping me focused, I do enjoy most of it and look forward to coaching videos, I like that it encourages baby steps. But, it keeps trying to sell me it's other apps which distract me and encourages me to take too much on and over load"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to have"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It facilitates for me to cut off all my bad üòî habits like being lazy person"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ok but dont bother. Will ask for a subscription and wouldn't let me click anything else unless i bought it. Deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"If only it were free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"To do anything worthwhile you have to pay for premium üíÄ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I thoroughly enjoy the experience of using this app. It's a big help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its not free i think its should be mention that its not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app takes advantage of people with ADHD with hidden charges and confusing terms. Get ready to pay your ADHD tax"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! It has helped me become more organized and stay on track. I now use it along with clarify to help, both apps are amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good so far but keep s asking me to rate and send things to friends which kills the mindfulness. Dropped a few stars. And has no widget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Life changing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is an amazing app to build habits and Routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My ADHD is winning these days, even with medication, so I was hopeful that this would help. It didn't. I didn't find it engaging and it was confusing to navigate as there are no clear instructions on how to use the app beyond the initial introduction to it. Maybe it would have been a better experience if I paid for all the extra features but I wasn't willing to do that without seeing some results in the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I could not get past all the clutter on the home screen but I love the psychology behind the free coaching etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. The best app I've ever downloaded. It can really be helpful. I also recommend its other apps. They are also really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Could be a good app but it's almost next to impossible to delete the account and manage subscription. Unsubscribed and deleted"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm always trying to accomplish too much at one time and with this app I can Pace myself so that I'm not feeling overwhelmed with everything that I have to do in event. I'm a live-in caregiver for disabled person and I always have lots to do on a daily basis because I'm on call 24/7 and I don't have days off. So this app is helping me set priorities that need to be done and I'll show to remind me to take care of myself so that I am here for my patient."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Would like to try for longer first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is difficult to navigate. Also, a reminder of payment before charges are made would be helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it's not actually free?? you answer all the initial questions, then it tells you that you have to pay (with a ""free trial version"") to continue and there is no option to use a free version. so disappointed. I was really looking forward to getting things on track, and I really could have used an app like this, but I'm too broke to pay for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful and actually does as it says, the style is so fun and makes you want to do better I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I gave it 5 stars before I had to switch my phone. The restore functionality doesn't work, and I contacted the support team. After 2 emails (one with some general suggestions to logout, clear cache etc that didn't work and one asking me about which backup i wanted to restore) I didn't receive any other solution to my problem. I sent another email asking for an update a while back, no answer. I cannot reset my old phone in order to give it to someone else due to Fabulous. Support is lacking"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This precious app guide us to a fabulous life that you have never imagined"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try the 7 day free trial of the app but they debited 3950 rupees from my account i cancelled the subscription riggt then but i still didnt get my money back How can i get my money back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app.. Recently, I downloaded it again. Don't know if it's a new update or smth like that, but it has changed. Mostly, I don't like the new design of the letters. They used to look better. They had examples and ideas to make this journey eaand interesting.. what happened???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dark UX patterns from a company that claims to do good. Their ""trial"" period is not free, and the charge after the trial period is insane. Sure if you read the copy it is there, but we all rely on shortcuts for things we use everyday. For example when someone says trial and then asks how much I want to pay, it is a fair assumption that the trial will be free and whatever I select to ""pay"" is for after the trial. And then good luck trying to cancel your subscription without contacting them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very practical"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty fun!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just a money grabbing scheme"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded to try and deleted the app the same day and now it has taken money from me.I don't want to use it!("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty great so far. Not invasive, but persistent in reminders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a shame to see a dark pattern right at the start of my journey. Science used for evil, simply to pressure people into subscribing, right after you sign a contract with yourself. Sure, let me buy a subscription BEFORE even trying if your method works for me. An offer that is promised not to return after skipping it, BEFORE evaluating. So no, I won't be using this app. If it has this dark pattern, then I suspect that it has others elsewhere."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Literally the most helpful thing on Play Store and app store <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"not worth 39.99 a month, not even close"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very interesting to relearn about your self and taking better care of your body and mind üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is full of good content. However, I have tried to cancel my subscription every which way & continue to get charged. This unacceptable for any app & I won't be able to recommend this to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try it on for 7 days, then when I tried to quit the program because I was not using it that much, I couldn't find the way to cancel the subscription and I have been charged for a year! It's terrible and frustrating how difficult and imposible is to get out of the subscription. I really feel frustrated and annoyed. Even now still can't stop the subscription. Please help.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love how this app is helping me develop healthy habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bodyverder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very well done now it's turn for u to play this planner . try this planner and rate it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really good app, especially for neurospicy folx. I genuinely cannot remember to do incredibly routine things without a reminder system. Habits do not stick. Unfortunately, having to manage your account via a website rather than through the app, the payment/subscription outside of Play store (on the website, not even the app) all adds up to being pretty sus. I just spent an hour trying to get a refund for a payment I didn't authorise. That should not have happened."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app but I really need it to sync across my devices. It's sorta annoying to have to start everything from the beginning on my various devices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really straight forward and it is a really great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Been charging me money FOR YEARS after uninstalling and canceling payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's awful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good app...very optimistic.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"7-day trial was offered. Canceled at 4 days but REFUND WAS DENIED by Play Store and by Fabulous. App was not useful. Edit: I followed the directions for a refund on Google Play. When Google refused, I asked Fabulous. In total, I wrote twice to Google Play and twice to Fabulous and wrote and updated my review. After those six actions, they did give me the refund. That was a lot of work to get a refund. Given the poor quality of app, I wonder if this is a fake."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The apps purpose, functionality, and effectiveness are five star; however, I bought Premium and the ongoing adverts as well as constant forced reminders that I have gift trial memberships to share are ruining the experience and - in my opinion - are counterproductive to the primary purpose of the app and the path it tries to take you on. If I pay for an app, I expect adverts and annoying notifications to stop!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome and very much helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"5/31/2024-Situation rectified. Still don't recommend & I won't be back. 5/28/2024-I was charged for a membership that customer service told me via email that THEY cancelled last year. I still have the email. I'll allow some time for this to be resolved, but if I have to, I'll involve the BBB and/or Attorney General. I'll also file a dispute with my bank. So disappointed in this shady way of doing business. I used to enjoy Fabulous but since I'm on a fixed income I just can't afford it anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Goodüëçüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this so far its helping me do challenges and tasks that sometimes seems overwhelming, I'm going to keep going because I really could use a reset."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok.. the app is well and good so far but I don't understand it's so complicated but simple at the same time as free features are so limited and the I don't know much about the premium.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app truly motivates me and makes my goals less intimidating. Thanks Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forces you to subscribe in order to use the app. Lure you with a 7 day free trial that does not allow you to cancel on Play Store, making it difficult to do so. Despite seeing no usage of the app, they will continue charging you and will refuse to refund you. These greety people only care about your money and not your well-being."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and well planned"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best ...i love it ...but im student soo i havent money to pay...but im soo glad for this app thanks...üòòü•∞ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Several online creators I trust suggested this. I know this is a very good app without trying it based on friends' reviews. But I have ADHD. Reminders don't always work and I cannot afford $35.00 a month that was offered. Now if it only charges me $2.90 a month like it says, I'll jump on board but I cannot afford $35.00 right now. Don't force people to give their card information up front. Offer it when the trial is done. That is better for people with memory problems."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes me feel so warm and delighted, I'm loving it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome user experience. This is really so beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I previously gave this app a 5 star, but there is some room for improvement, especially considering the price. When you are doing you're daily check ins and you are at, let's say day 45, and you can't check in one day because you are not well, it brings your count back down to 1... that is very discouraging. I also find that when that happens, the daily coaching starts anew as well, and you start hearing repeated coaching Maybe create some kind of ongoing counting for check-ins?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"generally a good app but too much advertisement for pro"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Brings you through a very hopeful experience untill it asked for money. :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You won't regret a single penny, indeed a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Full of ads for their other apps. UI is too messy. Also you can't change you initial goals. They claim this is based on science but I already eat breakfast and drink water, so why I wasted 7 days doing that? Also I thought there will be a trial before charging but they charged straight away. Tbh other apps better for daily routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is about my fifth time starting with Fabulous. I think the app is great. It's me. I can't get it together. But I keep trying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app used to feel magical. I used to use it at the beginning of COVID in 2019 and used it all the way up to 2021. But they started pushing the subscription and it turned me away from the app and I lost some discipline. The subscription and what they put behind the pay wall is so stupid. Even the most basic of features are locked behind a paywall. You're only allowed two habits per routine. This is so dumb I want the old fabulous back You guys seriously dropped the ball on this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the journey so far. However, at around day 9, I stopped seeing the small clips where it shows my journey in a poemy way, even though I'm progressing in my streak..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An awesome app from continuous growth and personal development."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A beautiful intuitive app. Great features. Add your own habits if yours isn't there from the long list pre-loaded. Prompts, daily motivations, simple tick lists. It's a lot more than I'd originally wanted but I'm finding it has given me enthusiasm for the habits I'm trying to set."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great for aspergers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Is there an area to journal?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As far as I consort this app is really get you and doing things in the slow and hard way recommended for everybody who wants to push themselves buy not under the prasher"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It genuinely feels like a personal coach by trained professional therapists who genuinely care about your wellbeing. Amazing for someone with ADHD and needing a little support and guidance. Makes each days start simply. So lovely and personalised. Pleasant and satisfying sound effects to subconsciously reward each step. Backed by science and writing renowned researchers and authors. And soothing audio coaching sessions every morning and evening read it by genuine-sounding readers. Just lovely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Complete waste of a purchase. If you're searching to legitimately change your life you should pursue therapy. Not this garbage pandering to the mentally ill (myself included) as if it's a truly life changing experience. The community support are chat bots that copy paste responses. Do not waste your time or energy on this app. EVEN THE RESPONSE IS A CHAT BOT NOT AN ACTUAL PERSON."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Worth app definitely positive vibes created strongly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app, but even after buying premium, ads from other apps are thrown right at you 20 times a day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription on 8/26/23. They continued to bill me $40+ a month until I threatened legal action on 11/29/23 in which I requested a refund for the last three months. I never heard back from them once in this process so I declined the charges via my CC. My CC said that Fabulous insured them that the charges were not a mistake. Today, 5/26/24, I received an email (the first communication I've received since the initial free trial emails) that my subscription has been cancelled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought this app was free. Turns out they charged me for 2 years of service. The communities are lame. the alarms are annoying. Just make to do lists and save the time and money. also the customer service is terrible. I'd give you no stars. but Google gave you one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Learning so much I've been using this app for about one month. I'm 63 yrs old. In Oct. I almost died from sepsis.I struggle with Parkinson's and starting to show signs of dementia from using fentanyl for 2 yrs. I I have 6 months clean today and I actually look forward to waking up and finding happiness each day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty good for making new good habits üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying building my routines, one goal at a time. I especially love the coaching sessions!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A lot of shiny objects, noises, animation without any efficient functionality to actually make your life better. It's like developers want you to live in this ""game"" at the expense of your real life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"O love this app helps me to focus"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*UPDATE 2024 Looks like they have NOT fixed their billing issues & are now having software update problems on Android. PREDATORY OLD app they no longer invest in updating. 2022- I hate this app. It charges despite aggressive attempts to deactivate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP! I was charged ¬£103 in 16 days after signing up for a free trial. App designed to prey on ADHD and disorganised people. disgusting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, a very positive experience, enjoying every minute of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good. I am really enjoying it. Thank you the team of fabulous for this experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have found this to be a great app. The steps are small and doable. My life changed greatly during covid, and I continue to have residual effects. It is helping me figure out what my life is now and teaching me to take care of myself, instead of taking care of everyone else. I really recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I installed this in 2015,unintalled it. But I'm back and back again. This app is that Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish I listened to the reviews before downloading this app. I signed up for a 30 day free trial last year at this time, cancelled before the end date, which was nearly impossible to cancel. You can't do it through the Playstore or the app. I just got charged for another year of service (haven't used the app since my free trial last year). Contacted support to get a refund and was denied. On top of that, apparently the app still isn't cancelled. Customer service didn't help at all!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In another level"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Happy! so far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App! I tried a few and even paid for a few. However Fabulous keeps me engaged and makes me feel like this can actually work for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"not working properly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very perfect timi6"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is so supporting!!! I mean how can an app understand you and be with you at all times?My life has already got a Lil better in just 3 days!! Hats off to the makers of this app,they are really helping people to make themselves alive once again by following the path of becoming their best versions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Better than my best ideas."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wish things like these were free. I download to help with motivation but I have to pay monthly. Like come on man. . ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've gone back to this app after a while and this time went for premium, worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A lovely app that I was excited to try until I saw that it's $40 every 3 months, which I simply can't afford. I have enough ""subscriptions"" as it is. üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Had an immediate effect in my life. I live for these moments. I feel so supported and cared on all levels. Definitely recommend üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üëç App to use for remainder and challenges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Comforting app. Just wish it was a bit better for my budget as a student."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They are just superb and committed..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's super easy to follow. I love that introduces 1 new step at a time. And get use to it in your own time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app, it truly helps me me a lot, I really wish I could afford to keep it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am about a week into my subscription and already am seeing changes. :0)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ Please how do I subscribe for the monthly plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the feel the UI it should just how much work has been put in this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app, super slow. Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Didn't like the app It's forcing to do what they provided Not what you wanted"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is fabulous! üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Transforming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"None of the links in the emails work to get to the subscription I paid for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Dopamine Rush - sound effects / visuals <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app can be helpful, but I have been billed for a YEAR now after cancellation. The burden is put on you to prove through paperwork their transaction mistake. This is horrible customer service and possibly a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cheaters. Paid premium. But no subscription given. Ticket raised. Asking to contact playstore. No solution provded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelente, no tengo nada m√°s que decir, muy eficaz!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my premium membership and still got debited. How can I get a refund?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't have a subscription and I was charged $40. I can't cancel anywhere because there's nothing to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It may look like a normal application to you but I assure you it isn't. I casually installed it and didn't think too highly of it. However this played a significant role in changing my life for better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is honestly the most amazing app I've ever used, it helped me so much, thanks alot genuinely!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many popups for different challenges i.e. deep work. Having used this app off and on for a while I generally dont need help with it. Also Today Ive heard the sound from night time ritual chiming about every 30 minutes. The little short one that usually only chimes when you have recently started a ritual and tabbed away from it. Update: last review from 6/29/18, The random chime is still happening! ritual completed, or maybe no ritual active, and when plugged into Aux ever 10 minutes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful!!! It's been great letting fabulous help me order my life. I've become much more intentional to living a more rewarding, peaceful, and clean life üòä."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helping me to build a healthy routine and new lifestyle. I just had a baby and I was going crazy to adapt and be productive, and now I'm loving myself again even when I don't want to because I'm tired or sleepy. It's really a motivator and organizer, thank you so much!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"With as many apps as it asks you to download that are all made from this parent app it would be nice if they were all in the same app just different tabs to switch to if you choose to use them. I also feel that it would encourage the user to use them all then. So far I like it but it still has room for growth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a interesting experience so far. My only feedback is the program seems to slow burn and not really explain everything. I'm starting with doing only a few things a day and building it up and the things are basic things I was already doing just making them more intentional with more thought involved. I guess it helps with my ADHD and I already feel like I'm translating these super basic ideas into other areas of my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sponsored app, tricked to download"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even if you have premium they keep showing you ads of their own products. Annoying as hell."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small steps encouraged on this program. A great way to help me meet my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The partner of my subconscious ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§óüòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I thought it would be just like any other habit tracker app: an over bloated Todo list with an alarm. This app triggers behaviourial changes, at least for me, like I've never felt before. The sound effects, the stories and letters/articles aren't just random gimmicks, they all have meaning and together they add up and rhyme so well. Every time I leave the app, I feel like I learned something about myself. It's been a week hence the 4 stars, depending on the results I will edit my rating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very uplifting, but not in a ""sales-pitch"" sort of way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got a false booking for 35.99 EUR even though I didn't use the app for a year. I deactivated the subscription from google play store. Because i didn't find a customer service email i decided to write this Review. I really liked your app so please contact me so we can resolve this issue. thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even better if it was free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app. Helps me to stay focused."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, very intuitive and friendly to start building a routine with by self caring and not selve imposing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pricing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app. I just wish that it didn't cost so much. Low income folks need things like this but they can't afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First self help app that has kept me hooked."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I followed all the steps given by support, checked background settings, and reprogrammed the times on the alarms. The alarm only goes off if the app wasn't already running."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So adorable app helping me lot ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's such a Fabulous app!! üíñüéÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have not been using the app for a long time but so far it seems nice and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its great that they let you skip sign in for those who don't want to. But they are making it mandatory to sign in to backup and restore the data. I don't want to create an account. They should give an option to export the backup file to storage and restore from that file later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That's one of the best apps that can motivate me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice app though. But i can't pay for a year's subscription,instead of monthly. I will like to cancel,and please refund my money as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far easy to set goals and lots of content. Hopefully helps me be accountable to my self with visuals on phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good. It's been one week, so it would be nice to receive it again later when I have a better idea, but it kept pushing for a rating so. Maybe it will be 5 or 2 later idk. lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Takes some getting used to but I'm trying to better myself. This rating should improve once my goals are reached one by one. It's a very different way to get things done Creatively!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Yes follow for goal s list"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a wonderful and interesting app. It helps you develop different good habits . The unique thing in this app is the stories after the completion of a task and the oath to yourself when I first used this app. It's a fascinating app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app does not completely download on my phone.It gets stuck on one page where I have to put my fingerprint to continue and it doesn't work.I was looking forward to that helping me.But it's not gonna happen.Unless I get to my assistance which I don't know how to do"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app at the beginning seem good for me, they offer me a 6 month sub for a lower price and I pay it, and after a week they tried to charge me another 50 box, fortunately they couldn't charge me, and before they do it I cancel the subscription, but they still wanna charge me, I already even close my account and uninstall the app. So be careful and read well how much they're rlly gonna charge you. P.S. I've been reading a lot of other reviews that happens the same as me, so just don't pay it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a premium membership even when I already cancelled. I checked the app to make sure and it was indeed cancelled but was still charged a year later. It was good when I used it but I no longer need it. Please fix this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bestesttttt app of the genre!!!! Words can't describe how effective this application is! There's so much to do! It gives always am optimistic vibe when I use this application. I feel contended! I'm really stuck the routines and schedule I've created in this app. Seriously, this is the top-notch app I've ever seen! I'm thankful to God I've downloaded the application, but I don't know why I'm not able to log in; it's showing that ""failed to log in"" IDK why it's happening? Anyway, I'm optimistic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really wanted to try this app... It seems helpful. But the premium option is really bad. To be honest, i couldn't able to afford it for now.. so many times i thought to install it again, i had to uninstall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really want to cancel my subscription and uninstall the app , it's not working for me and also the seems to be no option to cancel my subscription or even log out of account...why is that ...am sooo tired of payment notification in my Gmail account where as I was suppose to get a whole month free pass ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very supportive and thoughtful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged me 36 dollars a year for 4 years without my knowledge, don't download this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app. However it used to tell me how to implement goals. Like buy a water bottle, get fruit and eggs, set your clothes out. There's a what to do but not a how and I miss that feature"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of my best apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for forming habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app.. I am sure that being consistent works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really skyrocketed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Overall this app is really good . The graphics and drawings are really good too. I've recently downloaded this app. And till now I'm satisfied but, the problem is everything else that I wanted to use this app for is in subscription (‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢') And it doesn't have the payment app that I use. Hope u can fix it.^^"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very-fabulous app indeed! So much positivity. The people here are so friendly, the concept is awesome. The price is low too. The only disadvantage is the the animation and layout. Make it a bit up-to-date and this would be the best life-changing app ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helped me build some good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app.All in one self reflection , wellness, productivity + more type app. Engaging activities, excellent coaching, natural flow through daily habits. The team at fabulous actually has a heart and wants to see people succeed no matter where they are in life.I'm going through a hard time right now financially the additional time given for premium access was a total blessing and I'm extremely grateful for it. You guys rock !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware: Do not sign up for the free trial! This company tricks you into a subscription, Even if you cancel and uninstall the app. I wouldn't be surprised if this company goes under because the only source of revenue is people tricked into subscriptions. Customer service was not helpful and basically said Too Bad for you. Worst company ever. Update - I did contact the customer care team and they were no help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am a person who lost my future but now after using this app, I feel like I have been born again, I think I live my best life, I think I leave the pain behind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for creating routines and habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Right now it is going very well even without paid subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"very disappointed, customer service are appaling, I recieved an email for a free year for their Clarify app, which I was pleasantly surprised at, and still recieve them, but was still charged, ive requested help but radio silence...I sent several emails months ago but seems they don't know how to answer emails.. it's a lovely app, shame about the people running it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too expensive for monthly subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's paid full , total waste"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I never use apps like this. Always unable to follow up after a day or two. Not anymore! I paid the $16+ for the trial, followed the instructions and followed through on 4 habits for 3 out of 4 days at the time of this writing. Morning, work and night routines with tasks like - drink water, exercising, paperwork, cleaning chores. After 2 tasks done, the app paid for itself. Definitely going in for the full subscription!!! FABULOUS follow through! üëå üòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't cancel my subscription even though I stopped using the app a year ago. No one with help. They keep auto billing. There's a reason I stopped using it. Ridiculous to force me from app to website to play store to still be unable to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I loved this app when I used it a few years ago. However I found I started forgetting about it or would put it on mute. So I cancelled it and deleted the app well over a year ago. The last week they have continued to try to charge my card on file even though I have cancelled, I have emailed multiple times as well with no response! Scam! Trying to charge someone $54.99 when they don't even have an account is awful. Maybe they'll reach out if post here since emails are unresponded to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App is fabulous but the fee is extremely high to pay for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Give me my freaking refund... I have a case open since a week... I have only opened this app once in trial and forgot to cancel. Terrible support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*5/6/24 Update: They responded to review told me to email them. I emailed them 2/21/24 & 2/24/24 & NO ONE has responded to my emails or calls. I have been paying for a year! Now I see they are suggesting a different email address for problems on recent reviews. Had problems getting the app to run. Been paying for App for months without getting to use it. Have reached out to the company via email for assistance on my account 2 times. No one has responded & no one has helped me with my issues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had found the app to be very helpful. However, I purchased the premium subscription just a few weeks ago, and I suddenly find myself downgraded back to free. My premium subscription was suppose to be for a year. So, I would like to kindly ask for contact info to reach out as to restore my premium license."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It makes me more productive, confident, and feel better about myself. Highly recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but I don't think it's verified on the play store but it's rlly helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I have to pay for doing a simple thing such as adding a routine or a habit, then well there are better options available on the Play Store than this app. Also, UI looks cluttered. Disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wrote a review on here, about my dissapointment with my payment, as I had deleted the app. Got refunded right away. Brilliant service on their part:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It asks you to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Another good app that needs to be paid to work, even if you can download for free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The App is like an understanding compassionate mother, not a harsh one. I loven"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous gives you tools to look at life in a home of the way gives you a bloody to take a step even a tiny step which is hugely important And like it says over time these tiny steps add up, sometimes in your life you may have never known this. Over a bit of time fabulous helps you to realize you are in control..and helps you to see by taking first steps..or looking at things a slightly different way..is the beginning of everything . You have to follow something to help yourself. Do it here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's make me energetic everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Looks great, has some bugs, some of the pop ups for announcements are a bit annoying, but purely because they're for different apps. Overall I quite like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stupid app. Not worth the money at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to cancel an auto pay generated for a 1 week trial but why it is not cancelling, I m cancelling it in 5 days only,why this cheating is going on, I don't want this stupid app, cancel me auto-pay , otherwise I'll write it down to consumer forum for this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is effective at what it does. It's helpful. It's warm. It's inviting. It's kept me going so far and I hope to keep it up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is really Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I think this is great however I fo with we could make a schedule and have a kournal on the app but other than that it's helped me so much with my healthy habits :))"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app üëè üëåüèæ I really recommend it üëåüèæ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nifty app, but I wasn't told that I would suddenly get billed $40 without my consent. I saw a PayPal charge and had no idea what it was for. Incidentally the same day that I uninstalled the app because I wasn't using it. Then it clicked what ""Fabulous"" was and I realized that I had an active subscription that I did not sign up for. The billing and account management need to be more clear."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The content and notifications to do daily stuff are ok. However, the app has hidden purchases. In obscure ways you will be made to pay for coachings. Cancelling the plan is ""of course"" not possible in the app, but is a multi step process in the web interface only. Moreover I was charged the price of an annual plan after cancelling my current paused plan. Was just charged 40‚Ç¨ for nothing. Don't give this app any of your payment data."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app....Loved it ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous really helped me to shape my life. It really took me lot of effort to get back on track. Seeing people in Fabulous world overcoming their challenges really motivated me to face mine. For me the price is still worthy compared to the amount of peace and positivity it brings to my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app is a game-changer. It's sleek interface makes navigation a breeze, while its diverse features cater to every aspect of personal growth. From customizable routines to insightful articles, it empowers users to achieve their goals with ease. The habit tracking feature is particularly impressive, offering visual feedback and motivation to stay on track. The integration of mindfulness exercises adds a calming touch to hectic days, promoting overall well-being. Overall it is a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. My life changed, thank you to all fabulous team. The app offers various challenges every day that help you change your life for the better. You can create routines to organize your life and do daily challenges. every day, there is a coach who tells inspirational stories"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Everything is in premium...u have to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best i downloaded"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm trying this app again. The last time I wanted to subscribe but it was too expensive. Since the price was lowered, I can afford it and am glad. I'm on my way and will update my feedback and rating as I go. Thanks for reading."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps to refocus your life on things that matter most. You."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Damn you Fabulous. A friend sent me a link to support them in thier goals and instead of a simple ""check on your friend"" link you tried to have me do some cult like pledge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's pretty decent but looses 2 stars because you can't track your progress over time for longer than a week. You used to be able to track for the current calender month but now you can't even do that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have just taken the yearly subscription of Fabulous, so far the app is great for habit trekking. Will again post a review atleast after 12 weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just an incredible app, even considering to buy premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've personally noticed some positive changes and that has encouraged me to keep using the app and pay for the paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I unsubscribed two months ago and Fabulous is still trying to charge me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever created! Helped me develop a positive mindset, how I implement problem solving on my personal life, and the challenges that really helped me improve my self-discipline. And the Ambiance app... cherry on top!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have a more fixes life because of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very interesting app and I enjoy everything about it..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Right off the bat, they ask for 60 bucks. It's a slick pay to play service. Not worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the best app I have ever seen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Big regret. I paid for the subscription and things don't work properly in the android app from the phone. The nightly coach doesn't work for example. I contacted support and their answer didn't help. It sounded good, but the app has issues and i'm not sure they're trying to fix it or make it better at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app was so helpful to me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I get it free through my company but just has an issue with the overlay preventing me from tapping, so I couldn't access anything on my screen. Popup on my phone said it's not currently optimized for Android. It also near constantly pushes you to download its other apps. I thought a premium subscription would be ad free. I liked the routines, reminders, and checklist. But the app feels bloated and I have to scroll past their other app recommendations just to get to my routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing free . Paid and waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! I am now able to take good care of myself and the environment around me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app and all its features!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This all has been extremely helpful in changing my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app that prompts actionable steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I get this app for free, so I'm rating it as a free app. I wouldn't pay for it myself. But I like the visuals, the popup banner that reminds me to start my routine, and the checklist. I can't figure out if I can add more routines? It'd be useful for me to split up my day into three subsections. I really dislike how often it tells me to download its other apps, feels like a few times a day after completing tasks. This is a paid subscription but I'm still getting ads for apps I don't want."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not an app rather a sales man"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled and canceled the app last year, yet I still got charged the renewal fee, and they are now trying to refuse a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app that motivated me to improve myself gently step by step with encouragements and explainations. Strongly recommended!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun, like exploring the depths of yourself through moral stories. There are many psychological challenges that can be used based on individual preferences. Some are free, some cost money. I tried using the free version. But if fully unlocked a routine notification system is likely to have a greater impact on users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got the free trial, didn't like it when I tried the first time and ended up forgetting it was installed. Few weeks later I was charged a subscription in my card, which is when I realized I hadn't canceled. Tried canceling right after the credit card charge but they don't give you a refund. As there's no way to try the app without your card info, they should be more flexible with their policy. My guess?This is no coincidence..they take advantage of people with ADHD (their primary focus) to make $"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good.. Beautiful aesthetics. But I feel restricted as I have to wait a few days before all features are unlocked. E.g. You can't program repeating habits in one day like ""drink water"" x4. It's designed to avoid overload and build you up from scratch but if you're just looking for something to replace an existing app, then it's a bit frustrating. There should be an expert mode or something to unlock these features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: I was a user of this app years ago and downloaded again more recently. I didn't get past the intro screen and didn't use the app at all. Then I noticed charges on my bank statement and contact Fabulous. They flatly refused to issue a refund even though they could see I hadn't used the app at all. This time, I didn't consent to being charged. Fabulous presents itself as something that is there to help people, but in realty business and profit-making comes first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really a well designed, and well thought app. The way it builds up day by day is really enjoyable. A suspense everyday brings you the next day again to the app. It makes you atleast open the app. Once opened job is done. U r bound to go tgrough each days steps and the process goes on smoothly building your daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I found this app to be too guided in the beginning. Not giving you the option to customize your plan further feels like setting customers up for failure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It should be easier"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The ad showed a way of planning using a flow chart but this is not like the app works. Very misleading"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too in-your-face"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still in trial, and am enjoying, will subscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love the app and all, but I just have to pay for a morning routine... and just wanted to make my life better...I'm sorry but if you could just make it free? I'd be a LOT, and I mean a LOT happier. :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very useful app , which stress on improving the life through daily habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraud"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Es horrible, prob√© su semana gratis y ni dos d√≠as me quede... Cancele y a√∫n as√≠ me cobraron sus 1029 pesos y ahora tengo una aplicaci√≥n que ni me sirve. No te manda notificaciones, es S√∫per estresante en lugar de ayudarte, siento que tire mil pesos en un bote de basura. P√©simo no pongan la semana gratis se los ahorro. P√©simo pesimo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just got started and it's encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Productivity begins here"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app purpose, and it seems to work so far. Cons: constant advertising for their other apps you have to x out of. Maybe consider making it a side option people can view when they want? At least when paying for premium already? üëÄ also, it says see me tomorrow when I complete the morning routine, even with a bedtime routine. And clicking on notif. won't open the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"cant tell you anything bc the premium ad is so insistent i couldnt even explore the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app has the positive energy and inspiration I'm looking for to promote lasting change through small habits. However, the task layout and takes some getting used to. It also has daily short and colorful illustrated stories to motivate and encourage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying every new step of the way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best habit building app yet!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is one of the app I wish the whole world should know about,very effective and satisfying.. I'm loving my life with Fabulous ÏßÑÏßú!!! May God bless everyone there...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Well this app is not so useful the main thing is that they need to fix is that what ever you press or I'd you want it you'll have to buy premium I am not saying that they sould remove premium completely but they can reduce it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is greate apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been an incredible tool to help me manage my anxiety and help me focus more naturally. Having ADHD it has been an absolute god send. The only issue I have had is when I got my new phone and tried to load restore my progress it wouldn't allow me to do it. So I have had to start again as the support team couldn't get the bottom of it and asked me to send all the information several times despite me explaining and sending screenshots more than once. Frustrating to say the least."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good. Very nice app for personal development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, now it is HORRIBLE, and their customer service has been less than great. It's been almost 3 weeks, they cannot get my premium to work, essentially called me a liar after I did their TS, now I have redo it and take screen shots of each step to prove I've done their steps to try and make it work and they still refuse to refund my money. The account this happened in is also blocked from being able to leave a review on Playstore. I will never recommend or use this again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible üòç love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription through playstore. They collected it through my credit card. Fraud company beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I unsubscribed from this app on Google Play only for the subscription charges to go off a year later from me unsubscribing. When i researched further it seemed they also subscribed me on the website, when I cancelled the subscription and asked for a refund, I was denied. Not to mention that the steps that were described to unsubscribe on the website aren't the steps you have to follow. Nice one ""Fabulous"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm grateful it's more about self care than being a game"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The amount of thoughts ideas action talent amazing efforts put into this app by amazing people and I thank you for a better me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ew"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Things I like- - the art, it's rlly cute! - The atmosphere, it just feels calm - The app is very inspiring! - it is unique and intesting! Thing that could be better- - We should be able to set at least 3 tasks without paying in my opinion, but hey, you gotta get the bag am I right?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so interactive, I really like the accountability, being able to check mark when I have completed a task, and the guidance on habits I had not even think made such a difference. Over all very nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"We'll see. Still on my 1st week here. Is simple and beautiful graphics so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps keep me going and helps me remember to take care of myself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It teaching and positive to change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Glad I found this app again!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful in building tiny habits everyday and making progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its √† good appü•∞ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's one of the best apps u could use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"They charged me even after cancelling subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Refreshingly motivated to restart my journey. Enthusiastic about each day and what it may bring. Transformational mindset."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a planner its more like someone planning my day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app with so much insightful information and great engaging content ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Similar to other reviewers, they make it VERY DIFFICULT to unsubscribe. I paid for a trial period and *thought* I had unsubscribed and even installed the app completely from my phone, yet they kept charging me. I messaged them for a refund and they refused. I am now refuting the charge with my credit card company. This app has a lot of shady behavior."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Such a helpful guide and love the positivity of it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app, but more confusionn Nice backgrounds nd sounds, more motivating But really hard to find things Only few for free, mostly are premiums Just my opinion Support your efforts‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"no refunds issued. not good for adhd. I un-installed this app, 1 day after trial period ended...no reminder sent before. want my money back!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Veryyyyy nice app!!5/5 stars...It helps to make my own goals!*meanwhile no problems*üòÅ..so bye bye!!!!(I will watch if new app comes..<‚óè> <‚óè>"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just getting to know myself all over again and liking what I'm getting to know. This is a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't live without it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Day one and already feeling great snd productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app helps me organize my day better than any other app i have used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not sign up with this app! They make it impossible to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Most favourite app you can try this. You will enjoy it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app ever. 100% Sure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best experience I have ever had with this app unbelievable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hard to cancel but great tools"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"0 n√™n d√πng"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What to do with this,I don't understand!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous really helps to create a healthy relationship with body and mind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even with a paid subscription, the app is constantly advertising other apps developed by the same company that also require a $60 year subscription. Your note or daily journal entry will vanish if your phone rotates to landscape while you are writing it. Setting your phone down for a moment like I just did means you may lose the entire entry that you were working on. If you find something better, use that instead of this, and let me know about it. Update: Dev responce is generic and useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic way to start the day, ‚ù§Ô∏è love the graphics and the story line. I really enjoy how you have simplify self care and made it doable! üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am so suspicious about this one...why the ask for fingerprint...is that they are collecting them all over the world????..!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No money was supposed to be taken out of my account for this garbage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've just paid to join premium, why can't we write to do lists / task lists for up coming days and not just today? I want to plan my day tomorrow the night before at least..? Update.. Cancelled my premium subscription, what a load of rubbish, and by god they make it hard to cancel! Was meant to be a couple of pounds a month but I noticed ¬£34 about to come out next week, and for what? Nothing. Trust me, you're better of hand writing your own to-do lists and goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful excellent Adventure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm not sure if I need the Fabulous or Clarify ADHD or both."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app has been very helpful in building my habits little by little!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app, give me all what i expected to organize my life as well as motivation, thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Very effective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been great and easy to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I received 3 months for free! When I first started my journey, I thought is was a little too simple and basic. It turns out that's what's is so great about it. Small, simple habit changes with support from daily coaching messages, that keep you anchored and making long lasting change! Stick to it, it works and I have seen the improvements already. Thank you fabulous team, much love."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has helped me immensely with setting up habits and sticking with them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it all but impossible to cancel your subscription. Currently disputing charges. Cannot recommend. Update: I received a response with a link that wasn't provided without posting this one-star review. The link took me to what I've already done via the playstore (no subscription shows active), and they're still charging me. Irrespective of whether the product is good; I cannot recommend this App due to their questionable practice to get people stuck into their product."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Faboulus has truly impacted my days, starting from small changes that are truly easy to commit to, and teaching you techniques so that you can accumulate those easy-to-follow habit changes for an effective and long-lasting impact in your life. I'm mesmerized. Learning something new everyday never felt so accessible and fun!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't even show me what this app does before forcing me to pay... Waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app is helping me a lot. I have never thought of drinking water in the morning but it made me do it everyday. And it has challanges section, later in the journey I will choose many challanges to improve my life holistically."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Interface is messy and hard to navigate. Wanted to cancel from my trial but wasn't able to do that from the phone app version. I only have a phone at the moment so that's not possible. Was told I would get a reminder before I was charged for the full subscription but I was just billed the full amount, no reminder sent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Love most things so far. Just gets annoying that it's constantly prompting me to share everything with someone else - like I'm trying to use it as a support to accomplish my goals and the only goal it has is getting more customers. It is disappointing to feel like I have accomplished something for the day utilizing all this positive energy only to feel used at the end of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it used to be good. Now the quality is medicre after you complete the first few journeys which are amazing. Would have given it 4 stars if it wasn't for their terrible subscription policy. I canceled my subscription renewal on play store last year but they still renewed it on their website with no confirmation email or any warning and refuse to refund when I have not used it at all and happened to see it in my credit card statement where it wasn't even clear who the merchant was."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think the app is amazing. Especially since I have adhd, I needed an app that will help me with that. One suggestion I have is to add widgets. So when I open my phone to my home screen I see what my morning/night routine is that day. But overall pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2024 edit - still coming back to this app :))) Love the little animations and affirmations they have. I go to this app often and it's a good reminder that I have control over my day and my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT TRUST! The app will charge you multiple times using different references. On reporting it, they were very quick to respond to tell me I'm mistaken. After providing proof, I have not heard from the support team in weeks. I am now forced to get legal teams involved in this issue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Doesn't work without paying for it..tho first sentences collecting my data seemed cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very pleasant UX and actually very helpful. What impressed me the most is that, unlike other routine assisting products, there has been equal thought put into ensuring that you don't assign yourself TOO many new tasks in the initial rush of motivation. In my experience, it's always been the overwhelming feeling of too many new routine changes to the day that previously killed my consistency. However, this app carefully urges you to only add a few new habits each time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is the best for biulding habits, I recommend itüñ§‚ú®Ô∏èüëçüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good concept, it definitely has potential to be helpful to some, hence the extra star. But I found the app visually overwhelming, too many notifications so I ended up ignoring them, and it just didn't grab me and encourage me to keep using it. And I assumed it would notify me before my trial was up before charging the full amount, my mistake I guess."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have used your programme in the past when it was new and was going to pick it up again. Just started the onboarding process, all was going well until one question made me stop and instantly uninstall. Said question completely undermines your credibility as science-based and does NOT bode well for the content of the programme."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only been using this app for a few days, and I am obsessed! This is me after using Fabulous for about a week now. I love the app, and it has been helping me so much with a morning and nighttime routine and with my ADHD. My favorite part about the app is the little nightime coaching videos. They are so calming and relaxing and really help me understand my emotions and how to make my life a little easier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth buying the membership üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Customer service is horrible. I asked for a refund of a second annual payment and was denied saying I needed to cancel before my trial was over. Didn't even look that I was a year in customer who used the app twice. I have record that I requested to cancel after my first payment without asking for a refund the first time. Hopefully it's canceled this time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wish it was free of cost. They deserve more than the price assigned, but what if.... it was completely free for everyone..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that it does small steps to start habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes forever to set up only to see it's $80+ a year to use? Maybe say that up front"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"On point. I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only just started, but so far, so good. I feel accomplished when I complete a routine, but nothing feels habit forming yet. There are a lot of notifications so I'm taking a star. It is either all of them or none of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellente app de d√©veloppement personnel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the concept of the app. I have a big problem with the payment system. 1, the pricing structure is wrong, all that's offered is a 7 day trial, then you have to pay for a year, no monthly option available. 7 days is not enough time to evaluate a year's subscription. 2, the month's free trial that's offered after you cancel and subsequent payment method exists outside the play store, and I'm pretty sure that's against the Android play store rules. I find it highly untrustworthy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Such a scam! They don't provide any significant value to your life as proclaimed and they will lure you into buying a subscription which according to them is cancellable during trial period but its a huge lie! If you want to cancel your subscription you have to separately hi to their website and go through a lengthy process to unsubscribe and your hard earned money will never come back. Don't fall for this. In the name of taking care of mental health it is actually mental torture."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unique app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app will transform you from average to great. It's layout is so appealing and I recommend it to everyone else."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. ‚Ä¢ User Interface: 5/5 ‚Ä¢ Usefullness: 5/5 (especially the payed version) Fun and chill way to boost productivity while keeping a positive mindset. I recommend! ^_^"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day 3 and it's kind of fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good and productive app which helps you to organise your day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging and help to focus, am a new user but I love the app already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Pros: sets a daily routine. Supposedly it does this in an evidence based way. Cons: Makes you interact with your phone, which is a bad habit. Daily coaching is facile and not in any way targeted. Once you are taking reasonable care of yourself, the app runs out of things to suggest and so starts suggesting inappropriate ""challenges"". Every week it suggests I start a ""managing my addiction challenge"". Overall this is not worth the money. Read atomic habits and put your phone down."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far, but nothing to desisve yet"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Top!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"REFUND ME! How can you have no record of my account but have my card details to charg me $54!! I didn't even use the app in the trial period, emailed to ask for an extension as I was sick. You reply here is a 30 day free trial! I have trouble trying to activate that so email you again 1 week later, and you can't find my 30 day trial details, even though it's in the previous email ? My app still says try premium and says I'm on a standard free plan so I forget about it. Then randomly I'm charged!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the subscription still I was charged . Please help me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"tracking sheet not found on app.please comment to find this feature."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app setup itself is to complicated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Needs a dark theme."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. In the time I've been using it, less than 30 days, I've made changes I didn't think I'd ever be able to make because I couldn't ever get started or follow through. I've made step-by-step plans, made so many attempts to take control of my life and I never made it probably even a couple of days if that. Somehow by just drinking water, and what must be magic, I almost immediately made real changes in my life. Haven't even completed the 30-day free trial. Thanks, Fabulous. Seriously"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing because to help with your routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why does the app need your email address and thumbprint before being of any use?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just loooove this appü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The pictures advertising the app is not what the app actually looks like. I was so disappointed to be met with an order page first thing but tried the trial anyway because I was truly hopeful this is what I've been looking for: essentially a digital bullet journal. Nope. This is just like any other generic checklist app with nothing customizable about the aesthetics or even interesting, unlike what's shown in the advertisement. Bummer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free?... Uninstall right away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun, creative content that feels very supportive, non- judgemental, and helps me break down steps, enhance routines and be inspired with the wonderful artwork and accessibility ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoyable and inspiring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cheap as hell. Spend 5 dollars, no. Okay then spend 1 dollar, no. Well then you don't use app... If you are trying to build something nice and keep asking for cash, you are no better than just another ad app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not just simple to use. Initially i was impressed about the UI and its functions. Later it becomes too much annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be aware that it is difficult to cancel and they will not give a refund. I tried the premium subscription for 7 days. I didn't find the app useful. You can't unsubscribe from inside the app though, you have to go through an external site. I thought I had unsubscribed but then I had the charge for an annual subscription. I immediately reached out to the customer team and requested a refund. I was denied any sort of refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cannot unsubscribe. Even after sending multiple emails, getting charged, need my refund request processed as soon as possible. THEY WILL NOT REFUND. DONT FALL FOR RETENTION TACTICS. BEWARE!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Honestly a pretty solid service overall has helped me create new helpful habits for myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is ok but i don't need and used it ... To subscribe via app is not a problem, of course, to unsubscribe works ONLY via website. And you have to do it twice, if you miss the almost hidden ""continue to cancel"" on the page after you canceled, you still a subscriber. Very customer friendly and definitely something i would love Google to do something to protect the customers. And why is the subscription NOT show in Google Play? Maybe meant to let you forget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I missed the deadline to cancel. Requested a refund and Fabulous refused. Very disappointing from an app that claims to be about wellness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's clears my anxiety and frustrations"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nothing there really. Just seems to be a gateway app to other products. Nice graphics, but it feels like it was designed for children."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I started the beginning journey very recently, but I can certainly tell that a lot of effort, time, and energy has gone into making this app welcoming, helpful, and informative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely app...learning a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Claire Eales"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really help you by changing your viewpoint that how you see your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app now you can't really use it if you don't subscribe to it. That a bummer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've made a great start with this apps encouragement. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app this app is best for todo list and after completed any task they tell a story it motivate we us to complete other task only one thing he is add some widget's"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Why do I have to reset the challenge(8daysAddiction)when I need to get back to my first journey,I just started,I love it,but I need to do more, I have to wait 8 days to work on the journey,I don't need much effort for the challenge, I just need to remember to commit, I have nothing to work on without the journey, please help, I know I shouldn't have many things to overwhelm me and ultimately fail,but I need to work on both, I'll continue the journey and commit for the challenge elsewhere for now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't get it, the pictures show mental health support graphics/posters and self help tracking pages you can fill out, but I can't find them in the app anywhere. That's what I'm looking for, feels like it's mis-sold"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This does nothing unless u pay for a subscription. No thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very motivational !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Leaving 4 stars because I just started using the app. So far, there're a few things I absolutely love. 1. The user friendliness of the app and the use of colors and designs. When I am listening to the breathing sections or meditations the design of the interface is soothing. 2. The subcategories under some of the main. Love that it asks you to reflect on them, and some give you downloadable assistance like 10 min exercises and stretches.Only change I'd make is to have alarms for each task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Alarm doesn't work! Nothing worse for someone with ADHD than an alarm that doesn't go off!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive changes!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I absolutely love this app. It's helped me tremendously. I've downloaded it every few years. I was finally able to follow through with it this time. Unfortunately it's just too expensive. There's no way I could pay more for an app than I do for my entire phone in a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't feel like I am being forced to become a better person just a gentle guide."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stupid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started. So far, content looks amazing. A very wise investment!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Can't believe this an app keep up the good work üëè üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app is very interactive and you almost feel it's very much in touch emotionally"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"IT'S THE BEST üò∫"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been a year, and I just renewed my subscription. My life has become SO MUCH MORE productive, and my self-esteen has increased SO MUCH by routinely leaning on this app. It's my body double sometimes. I have recommended it to many. EDIT 2 -- It's been nearly 2 years since I got the app, & I'm thinking of subscribing again IF The Fab can fix this issue. When going through a routine, if I try to use my phone for something else, I get ""The Fabulous is not maximized..."" and the phone freezes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The worst parts: the app is completely behind paywall. So the large part of global population who won't be able to pay right now won't be able to take advantage of the idea behind the app. I think this is the greatest failure of the developer. We need more business with a Proton VPN kind of free & premium options for all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took money for 1 year when clicking on 1 week FREE trial. Reached to customer support and was told to follow a link and submit return directly with google play store. Now i am meant to wait 3-5 working days in order to get my money back, where the money should not have been taken from my account at all, but instead 1 week of FREE trial should have been the only thing i get. Because of this my review will be 1 star ‚≠ê. This should not happen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ‚ô¶this is still useful in 2024"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Would give it 5 if I could afford it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent design , worth far more than it costs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very high pressure app, forces you to give credit card first time. To say this app has a free version is nonsense. The second you try to sign in it demands a credit card or PayPal. You can't even use it for free at all because it ask for $15 for the free trial, does that make any sense? Out to make money, if they help you, hey, great, if not, hey we got your cash!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was very happy with this app before but in the last couple of months, it has broken my morning water intake streak. It feels bad to have so many straight days under my belt just to see it broken because it didn't register my input. The biggest problem is that it won't let me edit previous days. That could alleviate the issue a little bit. Because it has happened too many times, I'm already looking for another app. April 2024 Update: No fixes to the app. Cancelled subscription, uninstalling now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged after cancelled. They make it very difficult to cancel. There is no human to talk to. Multiple people online frustrated with similar difficulties. If your worried about it, don't give me a pat response thar does nothing, feel free to email me, or give me a number to a human that will refund the money for this unused app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I used this app years ago and found it helpful. I've looked at other habits apps in the meantime and haven't liked them. Life has been chaotic recently so I've come back to this to support me navigate the chaos and keep some sanity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed. I used this app years ago and it really helped me change my lifestyle and helped manage my depression. I recently found myself in a rut again and decided to try fabulous again but now there is a monthly charge!!! Before you had to pay for extra features but at least the basics were free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's truly life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it seems to be keeping me on task. I'll come back with a more detailed review after I've used it a bit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deceptive, secretive, poorly designed. Only 1 real screenshot from the app in the App Store. 7 day trial is lacking many advertised features. The Progress tab says ""Unlock after 5 habits complete"" but home tab says I've completed 45 habits yet the Progress tab is still locked. The devs replied to my review saying after day 3 is when this unlocks, but I'm now on DAY 5 and it's still locked. I got a notification saying to check out the Discovery tab - which doesn't exist yet. This app is a mess."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Outrageous. I tried to cancel this subscription after a day of use, since it was clear I didn't need it with another app I was subscriped to. It was redundant. After thinking I had canceled my subscription, today I learned was charged another $39.99 out of the blue. I rewent through canceling this subscription only to find an additional five steps that are hidden on the page. What a waste of my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app though me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I just wanted a simple planner app. Not whatever the hell this was... Edit: Supposedly I have to use the app for 3 days in order to use it the way I wanted. Clearly, I am not the right audience for this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabolous ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Luv, whoever made this app... i just wanna say thank u. It is helping me 1 tiny victory at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This seems like an actually helpful app! Starts you off slow with a simple task, builds up with little ""coaching"" shorts of some honest, though inducing, inspirational monologs. Wish it were free, but it is a year's subscription for cheap considering what it has to offer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is an absolute keeper if you want to start new habits or get rid of old ones. I highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is absolutely the best for improving the inner conflict, but not really for writing the to-do list and your goals, and it has a special way to encourage you begin what you dream, and has the most beautiful drawings, I've really dreamed having such app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have optimism for the future for the first time in years thanks to Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, but it can be glitchy. Like I was really enjoying the animated stories I got for completing morning goals. Then, the app started freezing when I marked the final step in my routines. (I think it was due, ironically, to an ad for another one of your apps.) The routine was marked when I exited the app it's stopped freezing, but I haven't gotten any more of ""the rest of the story"" since."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Organised my daily tasks and much more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I did a review for 5 stars in 2021. Loved using it every day and found that paying was beneficial. Not much innovation in 4 years, so may repeat. Screenshots u see before u download do not appear in the app. I like the evening & morning routine ones. Think there should also be planners & templates. More free reign. Sad cause I used to love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Software is a bit glitchy. Don't like the constant here is a question stuff or the daily coaching. Just switch these off immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its not without its own flaws, persistingly Asking to rate it and promoting your other apps, baised view for Western people. If I ignore this, yeah it's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've now had 3 overdraft charges to my bank account of$25 each. I cancelled this subscription 3 times now. Would give 0 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The first app that I've used for more than a day. The small habits with reminders for little rewards. I love deep focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so apt, name or otherwise. Can't wait for the next day which simply means PROGRESS!!!!!! I've already given a 5 star rating. Do I have to keep giving it again and again?? Whatever it is, this is my only solace in this MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD. Thank you Team üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fun and motivates me.Ivw decided to continue to use the app and am willing to pay gor it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice experience but it's paid so not that useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless and dreadful to use and cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly thought it would be just like ever other self help app out there but it really does help me be more productive and steady, 100% recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"There are many beautiful things about this app.. It exudes positivity and a ""you can do it"" vibe. I am not finding it so helpful at this stage for a few reasons. It is giving me goals to tick off, that seemingly I need to tick off to progress to the next level. However it's given me a goal of intermittent fasting which I already do. But only giving the option of pre-prepping and eating a morning breakfast. I subscribe to the skip breakfast fasting. It could be improved by giving the option."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app makes me smile. It is simple, straightforward, and beautiful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Eady to use and navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thought provoking and mindful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Expensive...Rather plan your day properly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelente app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Used it a few years ago while I was trying to gave the university enterance exam it helped me a lot to improve my life , been using it again for scheduling my tasks. There is a number of other things that you can use like meditation guide and yoga. I recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It motivates even if you do not do the habits every day. It encourages you to keep on going"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love all of the reminders, encouragement, and inspiration"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful app for daily routine ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivational and has a good self care checklist to help gauge the the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Visually Beautiful, Science based, app that delivers a wide variety of tools, routines, and steps to help you reach your goals. It's all done in a gentle yet effective supportive manner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING: I remember using this app in 2022, and I might provide my card details to have the free trial. I have been charging me 39.95 without noticing, they charged me on 2022, 2023 and now 2024. When I asked for a refund, they say is not they policy. Please do not provide your car details, they will not refund you like other apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app thinking it was similar to their ads where it's a flowchart. It turns out that the app is a game. The app is extremely glitchy. It isn't sure what day it is or how often you've done something. It marks that you did something when you didn't and vice versa. Makes sense for a free app but they charge. When signing up with a discount it glitched and the discount wasn't applied. It also doesn't or you use PayPalcredit. Over charges. Currently fighting for refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Every day I use The fabulous I feel great about myself and grateful for this App. I continue my journey to accomplish reaching very meaningful goals and so I knew I needed structure and support so here I am. I am gently and slowly making lifelong changes that will facilitate the path to reaching my goals. I have been living without much of a schedule for example and no exercise even though I do a lot of walking. I really like the positive and gentle support. I ü•∞ü•∞ The fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Disappointing Last month, I subscribed to premium for a year. Now, with the same login, the app asks me to upgrade to premium to use the features I've been using since I subscribed. Please either fix this or give me a refund. Thanks! Update: I have submitted several requests without results."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app I just don't like the fact that I have to pay just to keep going it should be free seeing that it's something to help others achieve their goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love this wee app. Keep it up guys. Always wondered , is the English dude ? Tom Hiddleston ? or not lol ü§£ ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me a premium subscription fee two months after I had declined to sign up for the premium service. The app was uninstalled and I have no subscriptions setup on my play store."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Can't believe they only give a 7 day trial for a habbit app. Where is the logic in that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great app really but I can't sign in so kinda ruined the experience for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"way too complicated due to all of the 'tools' available. Some tools require additional paid subscription purchases. Had there been clear direction on how the program worked as a whole, it would have made more sense. Very disappointed, I was ready to build daily habits beyond drink water/make my, thinks I have been doing for decades."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was skeptical. And cynical. I don't believe in crystal waving mindful clap trap. But if you were to use new tech in a science based system to engage a user in a meaningful way and retrain them to use a system daily to manage changes they want to make in their life...this is it. Its clever and feels like a worthwhile investment in the future. Its certainly helped me to train my adhd monkey brain to quite gigs and design my future after a major breakdown. Highly recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app on the playstore"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only started now, but the experience with the app fills me with motivation and I am very excited"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I need a refund please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"200 pln for 3 months??? are u crazy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great inspirational easy to use app. It is such pleasant experience. Visually pleasing and calming graphics. It nudges you gently to accomplish your self care goals, which you set at your pace. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have ADHD and out of all the routine apps this one has actually kept me on track and is working. And I have tried to get into daily habits for years!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING: THERE IS NO TRIAL. They call the sixteen dollars a ""setup fee"" and refuse a refund after less than 24 hours. This shows how much they value customer service and you as a person. I noted that their business model corrupts the relationship and boy was I right. Lesson learned, not dealing with this company!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I adore this app, it was my outlet in a stressful time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really nice inspirations and food for thought"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I used many habbit improving apps but all failed then i started my journey with Fabulous. It never forced me anything even if i miss some habbits , like awsome mother it tells me its okay to miss out but its great that you came back and lets start the journey. Really life changing app for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You are thieves. I did what you suggested in your generic message. You ignored me, again. If I could give a rating of minus 5 I would. Maybe your other victims, sorry, customers might like to see the emails you sent me offering a refund for innovative health solutions like drinking a glass of water. I'm uninstalling your app because I feel physically sick when you send purile messages as if it's profound wisdom. I won't do a thing. Karma will, think about that when you're clearing your desk."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Lots of adverts for their other products"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nope, turn away. Don't do it. App gets fingerprint then wants membership. Boooo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There's only one thing In want to tell to all the developers of self-help apps: stop starting mid-ground. Most of your services are based on KEEPING a good behaviour, not in starting it. No, cleaning my bedroom 15 mins a day won't work if my room is trash. Stop starting in the middle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is changing my life day by day . Thanku"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"’°÷Ö’º…ñ…õ Ä Ñ ä ü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app, it is as if I have a tutor who understands my needs... Thank you for this app ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Okay.so basically the app is just a useless space in my phone 'cause you can only choose two habits.like hellooo???????? I can literally write these two on a single paper.like you have to pay subscription to be free to use it.and if you didn't.its just better to delete it unless you want to fill up your phone space for no reason. Edit:I have been with the app for more than three day but there is still nothing I cant add more habits cause I have to buy a subscription.its only 1 star now not 2 üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful so far! Using Fabulous and their other apps have really gotten me out of my depressive slump. I feel more empowered than ever to make a new life for myself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really fabulous üëå like the namel enjoying it thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Fabulous app taught me how to take habits slowly. I used to rush everything, a flaw that made me stuck in million directions. Thank you, developers! You're making the world a better place--or atleast, making individuals be a better person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Insane overcomplicated design. Poor UX. Million tabs, links, sections. I do not understand what happened and what should I do. Should I go here, or there? Why? And in most cases I do not understand where I go when I click something? Maybe you want me to discover things. I do not have that much time to discover. Too many water. Too many animations. I see you trying to do something useful. But in my case you're failed. Sorry."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It cons you to register before letting you know you need a subscription. Hmm,odd this is exactly like another app with a different name terrible questions are manipulative. Are you sure these came from medical professionals?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great App for keeping you focused with positive messages and much more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best appüåº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Giving this a 4 as I haven't actually started on the app. It was incredibly frustrating just getting through the setup, please don't ask if I have ADHD then proceed to show very slow, seemingly unskippable animations and ask a million questionsüòÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful designs, wonderful infographics and meditation exercises. A little scattered feeling because they have so many different apps. I cancelled one to do a free trial of another, not realizing how they are all connected. Then I was charged for a year instead of 30 free days. Customer service was kind enough to reverse the charge, so I could actually explore the app before making such a long commitment. This app is very handy for helping you build routines, good habits, define + reach goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was sceptical at 1st too. The current climate is so geared towards instant gratification that in reality just leads to habitual procrastination and negative self talk. It's a vicious cycle that's perpetuated in almost everything we consume. As humans we can get so immersed in the hamster wheel of societal constructs that we believe we know the way out. That's when they got u lol. This app at its core, unlearns all of that to relearn a simple step we often skip. Try it. Thank urself later!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very good app for self improvement, definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I didn't actually use this app all that much and I really wish that there had been more notifications and reminders to do lessons. I started a trial of premium and never really ended up using it, but forgot to cancel my subscription. When I asked to be refunded and cancel my subscription I was able to do so pretty easily"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate it It's so unusable is the worst game I ever played It's horrible üòØüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"OMG so annoying way to force hand into subscribing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded because there are 10m downloads. What no one says is that you have to pay after a week. Um...that makes zero sense. At least offer a free side of things. I think this is stupid. Don't be fooled by the 10million downloads folks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great experience but on every payment I just get a bite size pieces of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have no idea how this happened. I don't even own this app... but yet got charged 136.96$.... is there anyone who can help me look into this?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb app for habit building"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it so much!!!!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Guides don't install even I have 1gb data and the app has permission to use data"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"In app purchases . Almost ¬£15 per month... not really worth it ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Hi it looks like it can be helpful I paid and I don't know of it has recognised my payment. Keeps asking for more Otherwise good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Their payment and subscription system is a scam. I had cancelled my subscription much before the trial expired yet i was charged for it. Also sent an email to their contact but no response or help has been provided so far. Nor did their planner system help me much. Never making the same mistake again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app as a premium user I like to notify you that notification has so far would have to be better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app only let's to do the free trial after payment. You should give the customers a chance to use and app.then if it's effective we will subscribe it. U force subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"basic app, nothing special cant do anything without premium version which is quite costly the dodgy part is that the subscription doesn't show in the appstore under the subscriptions and payment neither in the app itself. you have to go to the web version to change any payment related things which makes it difficult"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You go through the one choice questions and then they hit you up for a card. They should tell you in advance. I never give out my card info. Unless I've tried it and absolutely Love it. Waste of time. Lots of free apps out there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I never got to properly try the app because it made me take a quiz and sign a contract and then said I need to pay for the app. If you are fine with paying then possibly it is a good app but I was annoyed that it sprung it up on me without any notice even though I was excited to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Your on my wish listü•∞ I can't afford one more thing monthly, but I really love this appüíü and so will you people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only problem is when I tried signing up to premium it declined my card no matter what card I used so had to add it to my phone bill. Other than that I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please, add premium with ads back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've already bought a full year in 2017, and revisiting the app now. Surprised how little changed, the app just got bloated by a lot. Sure, it got some nice routines, but every page and action is so unintuitive and overcomplicated, filled with tons, Tons of unnecessary pop-ups and such. Doesn't got a good UX flow. Every section, every page could be rebuild from the ground up to give a much more user friendly, productive layout."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They've done their research. The app seems a bit flashy for my taste and the price is a bit high. They've tried to make something good, though. If it helps, it's worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I've been going through a lot this past year. This app has helped me to grow and learn good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"help me to do self improvement, thanks.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is keeping me going"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank You Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love, love, love!!! I've had the app for only 3 days, and I've already recommended it to someone! It speaks to me. I don't usually respond to CBT-based info (I'm more of a DBT gal), but wow! I hope to start my day with this app for many months to come!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it. Since i start using it i feel more motivated and less stressful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful and helpful app, indeed. Also very easy to use. Helped me so much so far, thanks a lot folks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is pretty worthless and also lots of screens before you even get to the app itself. My main issue is that they charged me for a yearly subscription after I had already cancelled my service on Google play. I had no idea they were gonna charge me again when there is no option to cancel on Google play so I'm assuming it's already cancelled. I contacted them to get a refund since I got no notice it was going to be renewed and there response was that I should have seen the date when I signed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm already finding following a routine for morning, work day, and bedtime with a commitment to small habits that usually get overlooked or not important when I'm tired, are helping me to complete every task without feeling overwhelmed. I enjoy the ambience music when working to increase focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is really good and reminds you the moment you forget one routine. Very reliable and fun to use. It's also beginner friendly and takes you through the steps on how to effectively use the app. So far I am happy and excited using this app. I highly recommend people using this app thank me later"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'll like a refund I'm struggling"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You guys are the light that the person might seek to find joy and purpose in life.. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love this app great for ideas and reminders as well help for a better me journey as long as you do it it will work #workingonme"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An incredible process to help take a person without direction and goals to a person with vision and focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good. Wish I could buy it outright. I don't do subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Okay fabulous is absolutely fabulous and with the free version it has provided Great insight of Great value to improve the quality and health of one's life by this amazing app with all of its genius behind it in whoever created this very special program. It's won me over and I see the value in the $39 per month price tag. It does seem a bit pricey at first but if you can commit to 10 days of the free version and follow through with it and apply yourself to it You're going to see the value."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No not much usable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very well made and engaging! Too much bugging for payment though!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the most wonderful app I have ever had! Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would've given 5 stars for the wonderful app I've been using for a few years now, but... 1-star since they started advertising their other paid apps at the top of the app-screen forcing me to scroll through a bunch of irrelevant stuff to get to what's important. I'm paying money for an app that's prioritizing selling me its other apps. Update: I canceled. For anyone wanting a less intrusive app made by a less.. money-hungry company.. try Finch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only really just started Fabulous, but I'm really enjoying it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the app days before the free period ended and I was still charged $59.99"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app. The daily coaching is what I like the most about this app. Really gives me motivation to do things I really want do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I saw this app on my ads, and I try it for myself. It's cute and aesthetic, really helps you being productive. Wish it has themes where you could customize colors, nevertheless it's a good app esp for people who wants to be organized. I will subscribe again once I'm ready to be productive again. Great customer service as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many adds for other apps in the app. They push their other apps down your throat, even too the point that you have to scroll through adds to get to your routines. unacceptable for an app that I pay for. Also the app promotes getting away from your phone and using paper notes and to do lists etc... in many of the routines. Yet it keeps promoting you download and pay for all their suite of apps. Clearly their hunt for profit has overridden their initial values."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too much info, too much use of AI. using this app itself becomes a task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me after canceling"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Outstanding app ! I have just started using in this week. My first experience till now is very good, Once I'll reach a level I'll update my review soon. üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I've tried it before and it still has a great base for forming healthy habits, but now every day it suggests another app from the same group to download and subscribe too (with a yearly fee of course) I paid to use this app/habit building program and the adds are not appreciated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is amazing!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is my long distance best friend I never had, pointing me in the right direction, y'all got something great here,I think everybody in the üåé should have this app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for building and tracking habits. I love how motivational it is and it understands if you are not able to complete a goal. The only thing I wish is that it made it more clear that you can move and delete habits as I am unable to exercise in the morning and having it as a set goal meant I was unable to complete the morning routine until I looked for if I could remove it. Overall I absolutely love it and it has greatly improved my life over the couple of weeks I have had it :]"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's simple. Colourful. And is helping me overcome procrastination. I love the story, coaching pretty much everything about this app. And so far it's free with no ads."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"hidden subscriptions. if I have to pay for it then put that upfront when I go to download the app. I hate that I answered all these questions and then got slapped with the pay wall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"yet to receive the refund after a week of cancellation!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wanted to convey that the suggested routine must have a timeframe within which they must be completed. If not, the user shall not be given access to that particular task beyond the timeframe, for accountability and time management purposes. Additionally, if it is currently 12 p.m., the user shall not be given suggestions or goals such as nighttime routines or goals related to making the room darker and quieter forrsleeping. This disrupts the concept of time-boundness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful experience, I think it's an exceptional app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You are a true companion in achieving a hard dream, thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm fairly new but so far I love it! I'm learning a lot about how to build habits and it makes building them really doable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Backups should be free, I think it's pointless to log in if you won't be able to restore your progress on another phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription and then deleted the app. I've been re-charged anyway and Google have not approved my refund. I want my money back as it's not a cheap app and I do not use it what-so-ever anymore. I'm furious."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"COOL"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app and I think it is best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems like a great app even good customization but there are some things you can't do without premium or being suggested premium. I understand it but I don't have the money for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app üòäüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good. Very interactive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nothing is working here, if you're using it for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. Its motivational, and so supportive and feels like a rela person. But there is one problem though. I feel like the premium mode is almost necessary and like that it feels like my options are limited. I would appreciate if that would be fixed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I appreciated the sections on exercise. The story line does make you want to commit, however I was charged ¬£35 monthly subscription which I did not agree to. I have contacted customer service and I am awaiting a refund. It is supposed to help with Mental stress but it's causing me more at the moment !! I'll let you know how it goes from there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Me encanta la app, solo que me gustar√≠a que se pudiera poner m√°s h√°bitos en la versi√≥n gratis üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great customer service and pretty UI"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a nice app, I just love the animations and the stories and their schedule so much. But in other hand, the notification system is not really helpful, no alarm, no widget to have more strong reminds."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very complicated UI."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Most positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"From negative to positive 0 to 60 in 2 days! I FEEL GOOD!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad.worst app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm really enjoying this app üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es exactamente lo que buscaba, me apoya bastante y me da consejos muy √∫tiles"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"it's amazing but very expensive. 30$"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't install this insidious garbage. If they get a hold of your credit card, you'll never figure out how to cancel. If you do, it's an 87 step process that takes and inordinate amount of time. I've never despised an app more than this. Makes me dislike Duke even more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app but a bit cluttered and unstructured at the moment. Perhaps will improve in future. If you you use it regularly you seem to find patterns in the clutter which concludes that it is structured clutter. Good already but way to go."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hi there I love this app ... Very motivative and to say this app set goals and keep us on track you may feel enthusiastic about yourself .... I request the creator that pls can you make this app for free I could not pay money for this as in India our parents won't give money for us sorry to say but I really wanted to Continue.. rest all is fine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Money tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Do not subscribe! Paid for a year, 2 weeks later they want me to pay again, different yearly fee depending on which screen you look at. 7 bus days turnaround on help, for an app that's about the importance of daily routine and mental health. And call you a quitter because their systems are all jacked up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been less than a week, but I've already gained some wisdom through coaching. I will see where this goes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"By far one of the best apps I came across, I was amazed of how it still worked well while offline. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to start their selfare and healing journey.üòäü§é"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Don't go with the first offer, they'll offer better prices when you say no. I hate I had to pay 30 for 3 months, my fault. But it's definitely not worth it. Would not recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the cost. I'm currently getting a free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Toooo much questions asking during Startup. Not useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have no words ü´∂üèºüò´üòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is an amazing app. Hugely recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still new but liking it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a helpful app to create and build new good habits and understand your behavior and be aware about your actions and thoughts"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! It's your personal life coach. It gives you that little push when you need it most."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I've only been using the app a few days so I'll update after I've had more time with it. Update 3/13/24: what an app!! I really do enjoy this app and I'm going to be saving up to get the lifetime subscription. The routines I've created for weekdays and weekends have really helped me form building blocks to stay present, mindful, and honest with myself. The mood tracker and weekly check in, keep me accountable but also allow me to give myself grace, if I fall short."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This os a great App. I found it really helpful on improving my routine, my mood and my self esteem. Brilliant!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"se provo a gestire la mia iscrizione premium mi dice di cercarmi il sito su internet... ma fate davvero? volete una barca di soldi e non siete capaci neanche di mettere un link per visualizzare il mio account premium?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I loved it. I did. BUT...why do I pay for Premium if you guys keep those annoying heads from your other apps that need a paid subscription? They're ads! Can you please remove those? It's crowding the whole thing...please? Edit: your responses to the reviews are ctrl+c+ctrl+v from each other...shame. The other apps' heads don't even let me focus on my own routines, because they're all over the dashboard. I lost interest in using it because I have to scavenger through your ads."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just one day I have already felt fabulous! Thanks the developer :D"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app and I really like"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has now put the advertisements for their additional apps above the main routine line. Why? How many people need assistance with ADHD? You want the routines on top."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app keeps me on my toes n moving forward...I am truly blessed to have this app to help me grow each day with confidence..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helping me sorta put my life together"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I love the app but had to delete it because any time it is active my phone doesn't work right and buttons don't work. As soon as I get it deleted the rest of my phone works again. It needs some bug fixes. It keeps saying it's not optimized for Android but it's been saying that for months and I can't keep uninstalling to use my phone then reinstalling it üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's wonderful! It gives me very easy, very helpful things to do every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think that if used this app can assist with building consistent lasting necessary habits that can benefit not only yourself but your loved ones with the individuals improved skills and decision making skills"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The UI can be little simplified. It has too many colours which distracts users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app to get you the best out of ur self xxx 10 out of 10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This seems like a good app. Would be nice to have prayer and/or devotion on the list of habits. I am also not lost to the fact that the app attempts to be as ""non-religious"" as possible (with the exception of a few adaptations of course) but I feel for those of us who are religious or trying to strengthen our relationship with our respective religions would appreciate a habit reminding us when it is time to worship."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app for daily goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've always loved the fabulous app but I'm not a fan of have to pay separate subscriptions for the additional apps the fabulous provides. You'd think it'd be an all inclusive subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Satisfied enough, but will be glad if there are more features with free ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was offered a free month trial then billed 39$ right away I want my payment info taken off this app an a refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app but payment is very confusing. I signed up thinking it was a $50 one time payment for a year and then found out I would need to pay $40 the next month? I canceled my plan before the 14 day free trial and they still charged me $49.99. I wish I took a picture of the ""you will be charged March 24th 39.99"" but I already canceled my plan. If you pay for the app, make sure to check your invoices online!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Helps me a lot to build new habits and keep them alive, thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app! Really making a difference to my life in less than a fortnight!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like my privacy. Data problems which arent something I would use. I couldnt use this unless i would be okay with apps makers watching my useage like creeps in my bedrooms windows. It wouldnt leave me alone enough and security isnt there. Too much data hog behaviors going on."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it that help me health üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too complicated. Does not permit to log off or stop the membership. Getting out of app is pain Difficult navigation. For amatuers only"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me to stay focused when otherwise I haven't been able to. I love this app and have used it since it came out! It's only gotten better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it as confusing and hard as possible to cancel your subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So many distractions in this app, that it feels like the opposite of productivity. Honestly, opening the app itself feels more daunting than any of the habits that it trys to encourage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is FABULOUS!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't feel comfortable being asked for money and a commitment before I even have a chance to look at the app and see if I like it or not!!! Why would I commit or pay up front for this app unless I know exactly what I am getting?! Too tricky!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No option to unsubscribe after free trial. Would change rating if someone helped me and made it easier to do so. It isn't even under my play store subscriptions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My go to when I feel lost and disorganized"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Well...the design seems well thought out. I do find it pointless for an application designed for lifestyle management to request a rating on the first full day, having no time to assess. Essentially all I'm rating right now is the initial user interface and my wishful thinking; hoping this app will assist with accomplishing my goals. It is very forward with sharing the app with friends and lots of book sales. The strained rhyming couplets makes the ""Journey"" feel children's bookish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful. It starts with little steps such as drinking more water. Fabulous works very well and the only comment I have is about the premium. It was kind of annoying when they are always asking you to buy premium and you could only choose 2 activities for your bedtime routine. This was a bit annoying but overall the app is quiet good. üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app. Transacted money from my account even after I canceled my trial within trial period. And now there is no one responding to the mails I send to the official email. Been days. Google, please verify the authenticity of this app and it's creators/owner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps with habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam alert. When signing up for this app, I chose to pay $1, it's all I can afford. I never agreed to $39.99 for anything, and yet it keeps trying to charge my card for that amount. It's also impossible to view your subscription in the app, let alone cancel it. Also not easy to cancel it on the website. They make you jump thru 85 hoops to cancel anything. Beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up with my credit card and haven't been able to open the app since first putting in my credit card info. It only pulls up a black screen and now my free trial is over and it's trying to charge my card. I can't even cancel subscription and I really wanted to try this app out üòû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Very Cluttered, unintuitive & purchase pushy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged for the app March 1st. Yet cannot access. No way to sign in. Keeps asking me to do the free trial. Again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"for starting sound. may be developer is not matured yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too difficult to cancel the pay. I have no idea how it is going."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoyable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even I have cancelled my subscription, they have charged me the amount The interfave is too bright and not user friendly. So many subscription based sevices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The information provided on the Google Play app doesn't specify the free part as being a trial before payment. Not nice to surprise people like that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Got a new phone and can't transfer account even though new phone has same Google Account. So when the old phone dies, there goes 3+ years of progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm glad the app offers something for free, at the least. The paid version is quite expensive for me. But I'd still urge anyone to try this app for once. The layout, even for the free version, is captivating and motivating enough."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a week + in, But it is so easy and I love that it starts you with small easily attainable goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíØ üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it's more of QNA than a journal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice and creative app for daily routine and good habit building."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very much enlightening, useful for a better lifestyle change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this is one of the worst app experiences I've ever had. 1. you still have ads even with premium, and for a calorie counting, ED inducing app no less 2. you can't change your account's email address unless you're premium (sounds like a joke, but it's not). 3. the support is awful, I've just gotten a response after A MONTH since I asked a question. I very very very very much don't recommend. it was fine at first but the bad definitely outweighs the good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is sudo science. Donot use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Long time subscriber, since like, beta. Grandfathered in to old prices type of subscribed. Downgrading my review since they now force cluttered advertising for all their other apps on my main page. I pay, I don't want ads."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled app and uninstalled. Still seeing charges on my account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly would have felt bad if I didn't leave a review. I really like the app and I genuinely feel like I have better habits because of it. It's an encouraging and uplifting app, and certainly makes creating new habits easier and more fun!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A lot of effort has been put into this app, but unfortunately I found it way too cluttered. An app like this, which revolves around building habits should be a lot more focused and guided. too many things happening. Also didn't appreciate how pushy it is about payment. I might have actually subscribed and used it if it was simpler and the UI didn't seem predatory to make me pay. When you say no, it keeps trying to get you to say yes - bad ux, made me not trust the app at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled and uninstalled and still was charged $96. I reached out and asked for a refund and was completely ignored. Then when I try to login to verify I did cancel it just kept asking me to register again so they could try and get more money from me. üò° Do not install this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good to start developing habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Although I like the app and the idea of wht it's supposed to help with, I hate that I constantly get ads for other apps which one needs to pay for. I do have a yearly subscription already. Stop showing ads to paying customers! Also, there is so many things going on. UX is kinda bad. Keep it simple please :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a pretty nice app and it helps me get motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sah c' est carr√©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1. Why are you asking me for my fingerprint? 2. Almost everything useful is paid 3. Interactions are slow. Wasting time waiting for the animation to finish and random quotes to get off my screen. 4. Keeps restarting my onboarding everytime I open the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downgraded my review because every time I open the app, my attention goes straight to the huge red button that only distracts me since I do not consider buying a subscription (I'm already annoyed by seeing it on the main tab because it's nagging me to buy a subscription). I really don't like it. The button doesn't serve any practical function despite promoting paid services. You should consider taking it down."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I love adding things slowly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it.. using it gives me positive vibes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The name says it all ... FABULOUS!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great way to keep on track and makes it fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Watch out. Moment you download it it immediately forces you to pay even if you didn't agree to it. I never subscribed for the premium but I got PayPal payments disputes. No customer service to help whatsoever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never even got to use it because when I was signing up and was ok with paying $5 to try it out. Somehow it also charged me $67!!! Which I absolutely can't afford and I wrote them asap about it and requested a refund and they wrote back once just telling me how to cancel. So I asked for refund again!! It happened 2/14 and it's 3/4! Ridiculous. Now I'm not interested in trying it at all! And it's trying to charge me $40 now! WTH?!?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Top app thanks for what it all gives!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fully money based app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloading 450MB of my data in the background without asking me is how you guarantee that I avoid your app or your company for the rest of my ADHD life. Asking me a whole bunch of long winded questions before I even log in is a good way to get ADHD people to avoid your app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app which helps to turn around your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you do the 180 turn you know you need"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing as it was selling, all the journey have to be constructed by the start, hence the survey is nor useful at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good: The app is pretty and offers a wide variety of things you could improve Bad: Most of the things I need are behind a pay wall I had the app for no more than 10 minutes and it immediately became clear that a lot of the valuable things I could change about myself you need to pay for, causing me to uninstall this app and consider another"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app makes you feel like the main charecter of a fiction story"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a life changer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Completely unique app. I just love the science behind it and I fully trust fabulous to help me move forward. Thank you for all your hard work in bringing the science into a functional and realistic life coach. It really works for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am reviewing my behaviour around food. Fabulous app is really helping. #12&12 #recovery"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deleted my previous review because the app has significantly worsened since last time I used it. The AD for 24hour premium feature has been removed, the journeys have changed and you now only have 2 journeys to work with without premium (morning and bed time routines) and the premium is a scam because they make lots of mistakes with charges and feature unlocking and have a ridiculously difficult refund process and IF you get a refund, the app is not worth it with the way it has ended up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is by the way a good app but I think for this there should not be any payment. If there is any payment please let us know, this app just wasted my time. It first asked me few questions, which took nearly like 15 mins and it is then asking to pay. And also it is telling that there is 1 week free but we should first pay and then only we are getting free for a week. If it is really free then before payment give us. Not after that, I hate when this happens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is Amazing it's so good to help and understand every person's needs The motivation you get from it everyday make you think Nothing impossible Think you so much fabulous ‚ô•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A really good app but the notifications and the adverts are getting a bit much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. It helps me every day to stay productive, healthy and fit. It's like a game. Unlocking new habits one after another. Fabulous has been a great experience for me and I reccomend it for all. However, there are a few bugs that annoy me sometimes. You can use premium but free version is usually good enough. Thank you very much. To ""The Fabulous""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unauthorized debit from my bank account by fabulous. Have been trying to reach via multiple mails, but there is zero support. P.S The team is not responding to any email that's sent to them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Started 2 weeks ago i am 50 50 till now so i dont know what to rate"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription before the 39.99 could charge me and it still charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just perfect for people who find it hard to make schedules and habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got on this app hoping it would help me overall but less than a week of using it, I found that I can barely do anything on it even on a $1 premium subscription so I had it uninstalled. Lo and behold I got surprised that the app automatically enrolled to my PayPal subscription and got me charged for $39.99 for an app that was uninstalled for quite some time. My initial payment meant as one-time thing as I was just trying it but this app had an unauthorized automatic subscription, so upsetting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this App, you can use it perfectly even without having the premium, and it makes fun and helps in my daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Update 2: subtracting stars for annoying bugs that haven't been fixed in a year - ""not optimized for the latest version of Android"" errors whenever it displays an overlay. Initial review: Awesome app for establishing and maintaining daily routines! Perfect mix of customization and pre-programmed options. Simple to setup and get started! Will be recommending to others for sure! Update 1: Still using it daily almost a year later!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well I'm actually in disbelief with how well this app is made it challenges all parts of the human mentality example I have severe ADHD and Fas also lots of trauma most a loss of money toward usually more than one app to help me but fabulous more worth wild here . When I gift the thirty day pass I think of who I think would appreciate this even if they are not struggling it's an amazing app and from a girl who has lived a high risk lifestyle drugs and sold young free now w this app I can change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. Its helps build up routine and healthy patterns in your life. It's helping me so much I've only had it 3 days. I can get obsessive and the app told me to carm, so I can achieve things. And the app has beautiful mediations & music. It's not that expensive not really not for what it dose to improve or in my case totally change my life. I've been battling with depression while dealing with chemotherapy and my ADHD. Plus 3 children. This app has already turned my life around."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Loved the concept but having to get premium just to add custom parts to a routine (eg 'Brush Teeth' to morning routine) or pick another one than like 8 free ones is a little sad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled and uninstalled but I'm getting billed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wish it loaded properly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How do I withdraw from this app? I've tried to cancel but it won't let me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Auto-renews subscription without reminding you and there's no way to remove subscription from within the app. This is a scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a $1 free trial and was charged twice. After the $1 charge I immediately was charged another $67. Unacceptable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't recommend this app enough! It teaches you that you have the power to change your own life and create the environment and the ideal self that you've always wanted! What is stopping you from being the version of yourself you want to be? The answer is within you, it is you! 10,000 stars üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy that I discovered this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I looked up Free and this was a choice but after giving all my info to start I was then asked to give payment info as only the first week is free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is amazing but it's too bloated with recommendations of other apps to try. Maybe have a separate page for it so it doesnt feature on your journey page. It's annoying. Especially if you have paid for the premium version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"the experience that they give us awesome, i like the story format but sometimes it gets too much of it. may be i have loose patience. will try be calm while listening to them. either way the addition of actions to your routine feels helpful and i hope it builds a new person or of me. thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for about 3 days now, and it's definitely helped me stay motivated. As well as make new tasks for my morning and eveing routines,to help me stay healthy and have more energy. üòå -Update its 2024, and I love this app. It has helped me with so many aspects of life. I am less of a people pleaser. I am happier and I have a balanced life even with a 1-year-old."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good focus tool and habit creation management"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Subscribing to premium was a great idea. This is such a valuable app, it has truly changed my day to day life and attitude towards routine and habits Edit to add: This app has even more material than I had originally realized! Under the discover tab, there are guided activities and even bedtime stories to listen to. The cadence and pitch are steady and soothing. I appreciate how there are different motivational blurbs each day / night and coaching series for patience, resilience, etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth every penny, easy to use and easy to keep up with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a good app sometimes it feels disorganized other it is good and helps me to keep me calm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is not a daily planner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid app doesn't have free trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not entirely convinced yet and I wished they would stop giving me popups about the other apps, especially when I've already downloaded them. Not fully understanding the billing system either, in combination with the other app premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps to motivate me to meet my goals. Value for money too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscribed for premium plan but showing as standard"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful and really helping me grow as a person! I have NEVER successfully been able to make drinking water a habit! I know that sounds very simple and maybe even silly. However, this journey tricked me into incorporating this healthy tool into my everyday life! I've always tried to get into the habit of doing that because it's gr8 for you and can help your body in so many ways. By applying the suggestions on my journey I am actively achieving goals I've strived for my entire life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is one of the apps where money is subtly taken from your account for subscriptions without you knowing it. I cancelled my subscription through google, only to be surprised a year later that they pulled my money again because I need to cancel my subscription on their site. The refund didn't work of course. Without premium this app is unusable, with premium it can be, it's a hell of a mess,just be careful, it's like a leech, it drinks incessantly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love, love, love, fabulous it helps so much for me in different ways vs. working with someone physically. Thank you fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AWESOME! It has changed my life!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have just downloaded and started to use it but it has already impacted me deeply, I'm now more hopeful that I can achieve my goals! So beautiful ü•∞ Premium price is also affordable compared to other apps. So many thanks to the creators of this app, hope you live as beautifully as the app you created ü©∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is just amazing, I don't know how to appreciate it. I'm grateful that I encountered with this App ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice for time management"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've tried so many self help apps, but this one seems different, more attainable. They aren't too long, nor too short. They lead you through baby steps and aren't overwhelming. I would definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble staying focused and committed. I find myself looking forward to my lessons and the challenges. Definitely a positive experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing daily and nightly coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the app but why does it consume too many data in the background? Please fix if fixable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally fabulousüòç. A place to build healthy habits indeed. Thanks Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not Fabulous... NOR HELPFUL JUST EXPENSIVE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The good: Great advice, easy to use steps towards habit change. Really great mini lessons for motivation. Beautiful graphics. The not so good: the sound effects are kitchy, there is too much to wade through just to get to your habits for the day. Pop-ups and constant notifications are annoying- there should be a happy medium somewhere there. They are useful but its overkill to have 7 in a day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I find it hard to use and follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Still learning, but thats what I love. And I think the little motivational stories are a nice touch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Interface is very messy even though graphics are nice but there are so many things on the interface. It seems complex. I wanted peace and lesa stuff on the wall to be understood properly but that's not the case and further they repeatedly ask premium offers which is irritating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, but with a bit of a difficult layout in my opinion!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had high hopes for this app, but it became vety time-consuming with the long letters that it asks you to read and all the tasks that piled. It was overwhelming. The daily coaching has probably 10 recordings and you end up listening to the same story over and over again. On top of everything, I changed my phone and wanted to use the app on my new phone, but if I want to back up my progress, I have to enter my card information again! I canceled my subscription and just want to finish what I paid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have enjoyed what I have utilized in the app. Using it alongside headspace and clarity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Got my life back on track. So ADHD friendly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the approach to goal setting and working little by little to reach more difficult goals. So before I got an ankle injury, the premium had me doing run/walk intervals until after completing the 8 week challenge I was able to run/jog for several miles a day. I completed a 5k with 12 minute miles. Keep in mind in high school phys ed I was doing like 14/15 minute miles at a much lower body weight than my muscular adult self. I found this app to be very inspiring and it was worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Overall a good app. But recently there seems to be a bug: In detail-view of a workout, on the right-most screen where you get a split-view over individual km/min/miles of your run: The Elevation Gain and Loss are now much too high, and add up to a multiple of the overall Elevation Gain/Loss in the left-most overview screen. Until recently that was largely in sync, but now it is completely off. I have settings in the metric system, km, km/h, min/km, and elevation in m. Please fix!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the way fabulous motivates me to actually do things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is proving very difficult to cancel the premium subscription. Despite doing the same on the web, my subscription is still not canceled. Now I have to change bank accounts!! Why does it say that I canceled in January but that my plan will only stop in April."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying the challenges and choices this app has. When you are done with a challenge, you feel a certain pride. The habits I am forming are life changing for me as well as my family and friends."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"gives you motivation and inspiration"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Being Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great learning app for new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app is to complicated. it tells you what to do and don't allowed you to to edit. for someone with adhd this app is every stressful. stay away"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"why it's asking to hold finger for seconds to complete full profile..... figerprint"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"At some point, the app was no use for me anymore but cancelling the subscription is so complicated and then you receive emails with offers to get back to it. This is the opposite of being user-friendly, I got really disappointed of that service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: already done that! Reducing the rating from 4 star to 1 star!! I used this app 2 or 3 years back and again I reinstalled this one week back and signed up for 1 week free trial and auto payment for annual. I know the date of payment and since I was ready to make payment. The payment amount was charged but the issue is in the app again it's showing me to upgrade despite of payment. Please resolve the issue or refund my amount. Don't fool the customer who trust the app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's so confusing....the interface is complicated. It always tells me do this ...try this.. All i wanted was a simple tasks or routine planner A paper sheet does a better job... It's rated 4.4 for no reason"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. This helps alot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Looks nice! But I won't pay for a daily planner. If you are conservative I don't suggest this one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is indeed fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"its a subscription based app. And my issue with it is that they show payment page only after the initial setup is complete, and they have all of your data. So even if you don't want to continue, they can still sell your data. Didn't accepted this Predatory behaviour from a ""positivity"" app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"You have to pay but it's very useful and there's lots to do!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It gives u peace"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cannot log in and cannot cancel subscription. Thankfully my cash app is declining it since I can't access the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged ¬£34.99 and I did not receive any benefits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been on this app a week and I already see a drastic change in my quality of life worth the premium version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I guess it's a good premise, but I can't really see how it's going to help. So far, all I've been told is to drink water in the morning? Yes it's customizable but feels more like a middle man of sorts because you have to download and pay for other apps to access more than half of it. I canceled during my trial because it didn't get going at all. If I wanted an app to tell me to drink water I would just use the water reminder on my phone for free. Glad I got out before that $39.99 charge hit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this it has help me with a ton I would give 5 stars but I don't give anything five stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been helping me keep record with myself more often. That I'm accountable to anything I do, I've never been so determined before,and I love it every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got charged after cancellation. I don't even have the app on my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"was so excited for this app as I hadn't seen any dance workout app before downloading this one and I love doing dance workouts, made my plan and was excited as the dances in my plan looked fun and 'easy' for me to do. tried to start the plan and couldn't do any as I had to pay. fair enough. tried to do any other dances they had on the site, couldn't do anything. a lot of effort putting in all you details and data for you to be able to do literally NOTHING."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please refund me, you charged me more than what I subscribed for, why?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helps me to become a better version of myself x"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Assumed it was free. After getting all my personal info and email address, I then found out it is not a free app but has a monthly fee. Not cool!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"what an astonishing app! FABULOUS takes us to the next level of relaxing and grant a perfect set-up for our days. I'm so grateful for FABULOUS app developers and its company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I just started using yesterday will rate again next week so far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have cancelled my membership and they did not give me my money back!I only had the trial time and after they've taken my money I cancelled it and no responce!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I rate Fabulous 5 stars because it is such a great app I first learned about this great app on my favorite youtuber STUDY TO SUCCESS and seeing how it work for her I choose to try it and it so great I cant even describe how great it is in words."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First app that's actually working for me! I love the snooze options so I don't feel bad about not reaching a goal, the encouragement is in the grace of it all üôèüèæ‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how much it builds me up, and the price is really fair for how amazing this app is. So far, I have nothing but compliments for this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'd definitely recommend this app for anyone who struggles with their day to day life. I know as a mom of 5, it's easy to neglect ourselves and lose track of things. This app has made things easier to stick to a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this one, c it's simple so it's doable, but had enough content to keep it interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As a life coach, behavioral analyst, and marriage and family therapist, I think this is outstanding! The app is motivational and inspirational, and it holds me accountable and uses positive reinforcement along the way. I've been using it for a little over a week now, and it's already helped me male some positive changes and given me good tips thru put my day. I highly recommend that everyone try this at least for a week and see if it helps you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A pretty good one a real G"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really liking this app so far ‚ò∫Ô∏è My favorite aspect are the reflective morning and nightly thoughts you get to listen to..it just offers new ways of looking at the world. I also know people complain about all of the reminders, but I actually really like them. I'm trying to create new habits, and the only way I'll do that is if I'm forced to really üôÇ. I've decided to slow down on adding new habits to my routine until I can get a sizable streak with my current ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please refund my $67 for the 1 on 1 coaching"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"AVOID AT ANY AND ALL COSTS. These scumbags charged me for a subscription on the 20th after I cancelled on the 12th AFTER trying to charge an empty card over 7 times over a span of just a week and a half. Look at Reddit and the Google reviews and you will see many people with the same experience as me. I will be reporting this company as fraud and highly recommend people not to subscribe at all. I have no idea why there's so many positive reviews for these scum"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been helping me alot it's one of the few apps I would gladly spend my money on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Now on day six, I enjoy the steady build up of routine and it's helping me take time for myself. However, I don't like that the app is visually busy with distracting recommendations for other apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a different app , helpfully and satisfyingly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great tool, if your plan for success is 'drink water' and one other thing off the drop down. Otherwise, you need to pay them $40/year üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm really enjoying the experience. I'm only on day 3, but it truly doesn't just let you skip through stuff. It creates an extremely intentional journey- different parts of the app open up after certain milestones so you can't just do the ""react, download, and forget"" like many others allow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been so helpful and rewarding to see my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous application is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Fabulous Co has a life-changing suite of apps that I have found to be deeply nourishing. This particular app, Shape, is gorgeous to look at, filled with soul-affirming goodness. *I SINCERELY HOPE THAT FABULOUS CREATES AN ""ALL-ACCESS"" SUBSCRIPTION* For those of us that adore their apps and want to utilize all of them in their lives. I can't afford $160 to subscribe to each app separately; maybe they can make a bundle subscription and give it a discount! It would help to change so many lives!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helping me with stress and structure and positive attitude to life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: I used to love how it'd been helping me build better habits but I had to change phones and now i can't restore progress nor start from the beginning because it doesn't show my journey, or keeps logging me out randomly and making me go through that tutorial (I've done it like 20 times, and it still is broken). Support doesn't help at all and is slow to answer. Time to find a better app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app with daily motivation for you to go on your path to becoming a better person"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thought I had unsuscribe through play store but still charged 3 times...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that it starts slow and makes it easy. And there is a free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I have ADHD and I find the app to be overwhelming and over-stimulating. Too many visuals, and it gets confusing to determine what is going on and what I should do next. The art of the app is beautiful. It's a very beautiful app and I love that about it. I just wish for a bit more organization and simplicity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've requested a refund as soon as I realized there was a charge that wasn't recognizable. Contacted Google and Fabolous dev email. No response. I'm waiting for a reply to sort it out ASAP. PD: Nothing. I couldn't go anywhere using that link. I've been on a loop, so I contacted you (through the website) this time and AGAIN via email."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Can't use without subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very great app, helpful and easy to use, Thank you very much Team Fabulous. Awesome job!üíØüíïü§ùüíå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gives me more confidence and courage to believe in myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a helpful kickstart to making healthier choices & and the development of new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hey! So my problem is that I have installed the app, activated the trial period and then canceled the subscription, so that I will not have to pay the annual fee for the app. The problem is that, even though I canceled the subscription, I was still charged. Why?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really nice, so helpful, pretty to look at and the sound make completing tasks rewarding."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app makes it difficult to cancel and won't refund your money. When I decided the app isn't what I want (it's too cluttered & daily notices were long winded), I looked up how to cancel it; FAQs told me to go through my Google subscriptions. I did that. I was charged again anyways. I emailed them multiple times explaining I haven't used the app and believed I had cancelled it. They said I didn't cancel it correctly because I registered via the web (which I didn't) and refuse a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has helped me in more ways than I thought it could I now drink more water and meditate more (power nap) and i look forward to the next step in my journey. Really enjoying the updates since restarting the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app. It keeps you hooked and curious. No other app managed to do this for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has really made me Fabulous üëå."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Far too complicated. I can't follow what is going on here. Unhelpful and vague suggestions which I don't want to follow and then it insists on pushing these on you. Waste of money for me I'm afraid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app.ü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has provided me with routine reminders and schedules to stay on track and maintain a healthier lifestyle! Highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good App..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Huge paywall right from the start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE! Once upon a time...over a year ago... I loved this app. I even tried all the apps related to this app and found myself stuck with multiple subscriptions that I could not get any info on how to unsubscribe. Now I'm out of a lot of money...I STILL don't know if I'm unsubbed. Customer service was no help. Emails I sent were replied to with form letters saying to use an attachment to help unsubscribe...but never had an attachment. I feel scammed. üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I need a refund this app is a scam and charged me a scandalous amount"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app, helpful with setting good habits, goals and bringing balance within."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good ap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Got alot of help in improving my daily routine and mental peace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Dreadful. I subscribed to try a premium version at a reduced rate and the app would continue to be the free version. I tried to get support and they ignored it. Then they charged me the full amount for a subscription even though the app was still showing it as the free version. The only reason it's not 1 star is that when I asked for a refund they immediately cancelled my subscription and refunded me back (I mean they still didn't give me back my initial reduced payment for premium...)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was a bit skeptical and frankly resistant at first but then I remembered I DOWNLOADED AND PAID FOR THIS üòÇ! So after some mindset shifting and a moment to remember why I wanted to change things up and change me up I have really been enjoying this! I love the encouragement and coaching around small steps taken with consistency conquers mountains. Glad I came back to it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best App! It has helped me with motivation and has great coaching. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely scammy, they push the premium plan on you as soon as you install it and give one week trial that they then convert to two weeks 'free' trial and ask money for it. There's no way to cancel the subscription from the app itself. The paths are very restrictive and for everything you need to pay money. Garbage app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They say they will charge you monthly, but they charge you for the whole year right away. Even the Google Play told me I will be charged only for one month, but nope. They trick you into paying for the whole year, which is really shi**y."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a beautiful app I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: The below help they have offered is utterly useless. Nobody reached out.Do not download this app. Do not click on continue even by mistake. First of all the UI is filled with colors and texts and Ads and what not, you are then scammed into subscription. After using it for couple days I found it very difficult to use so cancelled subscription. Yet, I was charged full amount of 799rs and now I am not even able to restore the subscription!!! This is not acceptable!!! I want my money back!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the idea of slowly adding new habits to those that I've started dailyü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks for guiding me right. And I just want your team to keep it up. üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoyable challenges. Life-changing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the variety of supports and the design is whimsical yet grounding."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far it's ok. I like it! ü´∂üèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, this app is helping me hold myself accountable. I really enjoy the convenience of it being handy right on my phone. The daily coaching is my favorite part."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE! RIP OFF! Tried to deduct $62.99 monthly out of nowhere and very complicated to cancel. Deceptive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Increase free options"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Update: I contacted the app developer and they refunded me the amount. Just a suggestion, but a summary of charges before putting them through would be wonderful. It is a nice app otherwise. I would not have caught this additional cost if I hadn't checked my PayPal account. Previously: I'm disappointed this app signed me up for something I don't want and charged me for it. It went from a $23 promo deal to charging me $90+.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I did not find it to be overly intuitive or easy to use, and quite frankly, it didn't provide the type of help/assistance that I found to be worth the price. . (As an aside, I also believe that I was charged for a full annual subscription when I was not supposed to be - the free trial included a charge that was early and not expected - but there's no way to get that money back so I've had to take it on the chin & learn from it)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have the premium subscription. I used it for a few weeks and then had issues with my phone and had to reset it. I went back to my original email that showed that I had purchased a premium subscription and it welcomes me but the app says I don't have an account. I have contacted support and they haven't responded. Very upset that I've lost 3 weeks of habits and can't sign back in. Please help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Joined premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps you make baby steps so that you can change things at a gradual pace so you are not overwhelmed and that makes making good habits seem seamless because the change happens S-L-O-W-L-Y. And they aren't critical if you mess up, np you try again. Basically you can't fail if you keep trying even if you didn't hit your goal last time cuz you got another chance to make it good as long as you are here. Don't berate yourself if you don't make it perfect the first time. Give yoursel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't like being railroaded into a bunch of introductory stuff that has no relevance to me. Just let people explore the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very organized routines help you form good habits for sleep and everyday life. The graphics are awesome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is like an ads tiktok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is no way this is designed for ADHD or ASD. This is an app is for neuro-typical people. These predatory apps need to stop."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Better than a paper planner. Very interactive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app makes me to feel free and proud of my self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app. I joined as I like the stories. I have to admit, I learn about nice books that exists but not in my library yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I actually really like this app. But I don't like how the stories end. They should keep going. Especially since it shows a graphic of the days... but then there is no story after the three gems. This is disappointing and I think that there should be stories for the whole three mountains."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Deutsche App Version hat weitaus weniger Features f<r den gleichen Preis, daher App nur im englischen nutzen f√ºr vollen Umfang. Im Englischen aber winer Super App."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it feels like an Ads app. I was seeing only ads constantly when i was using the free version so I decided to get the subscription. And only the ads for subscription went away. There's a bottom section just for ads. Banner keeps appearing on the top to rate the app so frequently. I kept dismissing the banner and it kept appearing so here i am, rating the app after cancelling the subscription and uninstalling the app. Also, too many notifications and sometimes there's click functionality missing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I already even deleted my account, but you still try to take money from my card........"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They have charged my credit card without my permission and they do not even reply to my emails. I downloaded the app for 1 week. Be careful, they try to mislead you with the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slow and steady."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it. This app is amazing. It works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wanted to put 5star review. Because why not. It's makin me drink water more than my parents do. I love that app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app looks cute but there is actualy not much variety in it. Times do not work, if your bed routine is after 12am it automaticly goes to a next day. It's not very user friendly cause it forces you to follow jurneys and does not let you to creathe your own. It's not worth the money, there is much more free apps that do the same thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Every single reply to a negative review is the same pro forma response, and since most of the negative comments are focused on the same issues, it's almost hilarious. ""New habits are hard blah blah blah...3 days blah blah blah"" For an app to call itself Fabulous and be so out of touch and not paying attention and sneaky about billing, its all of the worst app experiences in one. Hope you're enjoying being a caricature."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app but we have to pay money fot more habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's only been 5 days, but thoroughly enjoying it. Started with such a small goal (3 days of drinking water when I wake up), that seemed silly. However, after completing it, I felt a boost. Not too mention apparently drinking water first thing in the am is energizing. Yeah, I didn‚Äôt think it would either üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just started using but so far it's helping to keep me focused on my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's difficult for me to keep up with the routine but I'm going to keep trying. It's already been helping me not get so overwhelmed in my journey of healing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I added this app for 2 days and didn't like it, so I uninstalled the app before my $6 trial was over, and I was still charged $39.99! I have no phone number to contact them to get a refund. I'm not very happy with them/it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very well done. I have been incorporating this app into my daily routine along with my Fitness Pal (food plan , Better Me (chair yoga), and Samsung Health ( exercise routine and step calculator )for about two weeks. I like the motivational techniques they use. Very uplifting and low pressure. Allows me a great deal of latitude and lets me set my own pace. If you are just starting out developing a routine and have struggled in the past, this is an excellent way to get started."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Even though I'm not using premium, it's still been very helpful especially with the reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The positive reminders are an important part of my recovery journey. They remind me to be patient and kind to myself as I make myself a priority for the first time that I can remember."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience from my side"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonder ful application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it. Would recommend to anyone interested in personal growth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was loving to use it, but since changing phones I can't restore my premium membership nor restore my progress! When trying to restore the backup, it fails in all tries, knowing that it will fail, the app already provides a link to send a message to support, and then crashes when you go back to home (shows only a blank page with home). Upon closing and reopening the app, you're forced to answer the same quiz and see the mini tutorial every time. Couldn't it start the login info? frustrating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yessss Good Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been really helpful. I feel like I have a friend who accompanies me, tolerates my shortcomings, and helps me be better each day."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would be nicer to know its paid furst before going through all the steps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thought I was paying $5 for a trial and got hit with a $67.00 fee-Disgusting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app love the daily dopamine reward I get from each complete task. Makes me smile üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tool to add with your daily routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Thought, wow this app looks great! You have to pay for a membership to use most of the settings"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app and This app are great and good way learn for me and for all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep you on track and grow good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged money from my card one month after I cancelled their app on trial period."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So wonderful... I'm proud to be on this Journey of self-discovery üòÅ üíö üíØ üí™üèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have enjoyed myself with this app, and I'm not perfect, but it keeps me going to try. I have already started to see changes in me, and I am very pleased."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"On the paid subscription and so far so good üòä I have built new healthy habits and feeling better for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only money minded app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A good app but the branding is annoying. I've made some good changes with the help of this app and got some really great ideas from the coaching briefs. But this relentless ""Here, in the world of Fabulous...blablabla"" makes me feel like I joined a cult. It's as annoying as it is unnecessary. I'm quite able to know what app I am currently using without being told constantly. An attempt to bind the customer to a company feels very 1990s."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The greatest"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app I love it but they gave my girl one price and me another I'd like to be paying her price"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice routine planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Definitely a good app it helps in focusing my work better and has various challenges which is really productive ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"If I cancel subscription in between a year, will I get my balance money back?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Feels really weird. I don't like the symbolism of pyramids and portals..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is something very different and you must try it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"using a different app now but it was good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been using this app for almost 4 years or more (not continuous) . I loved the premise of app. And I love the positive and encouraging circles. Though there are barely any interactions. But after a certain point I keep giving up on this app. Even if I miss one day my mind goes back on previous track and the chores feel too much. (They are not). So my advice? don't miss a day don't just DON'T. Especially in initial stage. So excited to reinstall this and hopefully have a year long streak"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Please install this app and try and implement it into your daily life. It's amazing how helpful it has been. Good luck!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app that can help you build your desired habits one step at a time and with no pressure at all. I wish there could be a free version so that it can easily be accessible by more people who struggle with their habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The feeling of calming down relaxation and stress lifting off my shoulders felt great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Canceled the day my 'free' trail was over. Charged 35 for an app I don't use and can find no way to contact anyone üòî DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's good and fun but recently it has some glitches like repeating the streaks 3 or more times over and over after each done task. It's pissing me off honestly. I appreciate the quick reply. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love the gamified usage of the app. It's fun, interactive, and helps me stay on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Though the app is good for me, after my first subscription went through I received an email saying that they will give me additional 3 months for free. All I have to do is cancel my Google Playstore subscription and give my card details to fabulous payment gateway. Then I get 450 days subscription for payment of ~1400 already done at playstore. After this trial is completed it will cost me aront 3600 per year. So apparently they are scamming even Google alongwith subscribers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"whenever i try to complete registration after entering my goals the app just shows a blue screen and the words ""content can't be filled automatically"". kindly fix this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is nicely done but it's has become very commercial. They try to sell you additional paid apps from the same company right on the home screen and I didn't find a way to not have these adds there all the time. I also couldn't find the feature or branching habits tracks as they show on the first picture in the app store (the one with the branching pathways), so is this just marketing but actually not a feature of the app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app drives me absolutely crazy with it's alarms. I have turned all reminders off and an alarm still goes off and I have to go into the active apps on my phone to stop it. This is a number of steps I have to take or it won't shut off. I'm so annoyed I've paused the app completely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In just a few short days of using Fabulous, my mindfulness of habits has become more natural."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I ‚ù§Ô∏è All New & Useful Features, Especially 4 HSP, ADHD, Autism & Other Conditions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buggy app. Keeps saying I'm offline when not. Not very flexible to let you make goals in your own way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it improved my energy and productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate and personal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For the love of God, please update this app so it doesn't freeze my screen when it opens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Amazing! After being charged 58 dollars for the optional package, I was told to drink water for 5 days before I unlock the next features that I'm paying for. Unless you're delivering me holy water straight from the Vatican, I'm not entirely sure it's worth the price."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely magical"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a really awesome app! I love how simplistic, informative, and organized it is. It makes me feel like I can really do anything if I just add a little bit of structure and productivity into my every day life! Though, I wish this app had a more affordable subscription, I certainly appreciate the level of help and assistance that has been designed into this app! üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good for your mental health. You're going to love Fabulous. It helps you get through hurtles in your mental health journey. It also helps you organize."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Am new to this"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but it should be free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is slow and jystvabout notifications. This could be done in well planned calender."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam - I signed up for a $2 trial and got charged an additional $100. Reddit is full of similar stories with this app. Avoid!!! Yup, Ive tried emailing the contact centre no response so far..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They want your email and fingerprint before you can even look at what the app is. For those who are curious, it's just another ""pick a goal and we'll send you 100s of notifications"" The app itself is white and sterile feeling tho the survey art is beautiful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app was amazing. But now you cant put new habits without paying the premium version. If you had put some habits on the past you can check them. But if you dont put any habits you can't do it without paying. And that is so uneless.. Hope you fix that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is presentable and fun to use. However, similarly to other apps that take advantage of unclear terms and conditions with a cheap trial cost (in this case, 99 cents), I was hit with a 39.99 charge after paying for a basic trial. I reached out to support, who informed me that this is a nonrefundable cost. While I may have continued to use the app in the future, nonrefundable subscription costs hidden behind unclear trial language is unappealing. Won't be returning to this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"don't even bother installing it. everything is locked behind a paywall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super cool it works and fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscription cancelled but charged again for another year. Not happy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It should have 4 habits to add in free plan üòñüòñotherwise it's a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app.. I like it alot, I try to use it as much as I can. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a better life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has definitely helped me start a new life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great accountability app but the way it's structured is a little confusing and I wish the alerts were a little more goal specific rather than coaching-centric. That being said, this app is so helpful. It helps me correct habits a little at a time, which is a great way to help me stay consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am building slowing but steadily"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the app but can you add the Arabic language because I'm not fluent in English"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Notifications do not lead to app upon clicking them. Please fix it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not happy as even though i cancelled ny FREE trial they havr still charged me ¬£36.99 ü§¨"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a shame they are still taking money even though I only tried the free trial and then I canceled my subscription and deleted my account and they have charged me over 100 dollars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app and has a cute design. However, it is not very user-oriented. You have to follow certain paths, even as a paying customer, and if you don't, the app doesn't work very well. Timers don't work correctly, you cannot create your own routine without being constantly reminded that there are ""journeys"" to follow etc. I think the app would improve drastically if there was just more freedom of use and less pressure to try functions you're not interested in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's definitely helped me remain focused and consistent. something I definitely struggle with. It gives you reminders and cute pictures with your ""journey"" of how well you're keeping up with your habits. I kind of love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a good app but the subscription is tricky to get out of and very sneaky I got charged after thinking I had cancelled... And no reply to my email! Really pissed off!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent company. No option to cancel subscription. Canned response from customer support is incorrect. Reporting them to the BBB."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the greatest app. It's easy and there is something new each say."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wasn't great longterm ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø was hoping it would help my adhd / habit forming Edit: I tried doing it gradually and actually was able to form the habits I was prioritizing but not with the help of this app lol"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Really don't enjoy the ads about turning from ""ADHD mom to mom of the year"" as a promotional piece feels weirdly albeist that you can't be a good mom and have ADHD. I used the app previously and had a fairly good experience but this was before increased monetisation and I found the habits didn't end up staying beyond 'the honeymoon period' of a few weeks trying something new."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really amazing, it's feels like i have a friend who is helping me in my path"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I haven't been using the app for that long, so I can't give too much of an informed review. However, a major downfall is that you cannot connect it with your wearables. Please make it possible for it to connect with a smart watch. Without this option I don't know how well will I be able to meet my personal goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hi. Today at 8:29:37 Kyiv time by card(starts at 4 and ends at 28) was charged for $29.99. but the problem is that I have no subscription. I checked all my accounts - I canceled it everywhere and have no active subscriptions. Could you please help me to find out which account have my card as payment method?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app froze on my phone, also I couldn't find a way to cancel my membership. They charged me ¬£34.99. I want to stop payment and get a refund as I never used it. Can anyone help..."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"ƒ∞t could be good, but please man. , whenever i want to do something, he said , you have to buy premium,,,, god ,it irritates me, good idea, i liked it ,but this problem make me leaving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded the app a few days ago and got an amazing offer for Premium. Great.... except today the app has been constantly asking me to purchase Premium. Apparently, it is gone from my app? (Still shows under Subscriptions in my Google Play app) The last thing I got... a very condescending letter that starts with ""You started Fabulous Premium, but then you decided to quit. "".... what?????"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The unpaid version doesn't have anything you can't achieve without a pen and paper, so maybe if you have some trouble with making your own lists, this will help. The unpaid version has a daily coach that gives you words of encouragement, and challenges, but both, again, can be found somewhere else for free. It has a straight forward lay out though, and the coachings are easier to find than if they were free, but other than that, I wouldn't spend the money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like & cancelled but it tried to bill me anyways I've now tried 3 times to cancel. NONE of the options lead to the shown cancellation options. Y'all can find my payment info but not my acct info?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I somehow made a review I don't remember."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I don't really like that I can't remove the affiliate apps recommendations even tho they aren't relevant to me. I'd also appreciate some widgets as I don't like to have any notifications on."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good üëç, after three days"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1 star just because of how difficult they make it to unsubscribe and stop payments. I thought when I deactivated my account it would stop payments. Nope you can't even cancel on the app or through Google play. You have to log into their website. That is scummy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many in app purchases. You cant use it properly without getting the premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üóëÔ∏è Trash!!! Money making app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"charged twice and no way to contact"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel so motivated and am so excited for this journey. The app is easy to navigate and lots of fun to set up. I feel real motivation from their daily coaching and can't wait to explore more as I continue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the tips and coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app..... Really helpful for transformation of your daily habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stop trying to take your payment. I canceled my subscription. It happens again I will report it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is okay, managing your subscription is difficult, support is so inhuman. They cancelled my membership against my wishes and now won't reply when I asked them to reinstate it ü•¥ Edit: in response to your reply. I've sent you emails already over the past week, if the team was here to help they'd just reply to one of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, very ""humanistic"" app, u feel like someone is holding your hand all the way in this journey call Life. You are not alone anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged my card for a subscription that I didn't give them permission too. When I saw that cost after they had me put my card in, I decided to decline to use the service. I went to view my banking account to make sure all my transactions were correct and noticed that it was still on my account. I was refused a refund because it had been longer than 2 days and I never use the app. They clearly should be able to go back and actually see if I used it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very greatful but payable app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Iam absolutely loving this!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I really like it. I'm only on Day 3. I like that it slowly unlocks next steps, so u can't do too much at a time. But I would like to be able to do a bit more. I'm really looking forward to the next 2-weeks to see more functions open to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This was cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful art and animations ! The short videos help you feel calm and motivated . And I like how they set up goals for you without overwhelming you with too many goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"these people took my money without any notification after 1 month of personal pass I wrote them immediately and they said they would answer in 4 days and they didn't want to do refund, I wrote and wrote they ignore me, you charged me for 1 year. I didn't like this app at all and I deleted and I couldn't see the subscription on Google Play and I thought they wouldn't charge as I deleted but 28.01.2024 they charged $39.99 that I wanted to spend on my medications for acne! Please return my money(("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is incredibly difficult to cancel a subscription - currently the option to cancel is not even working... Be careful, they really try to get their money in every possible way, it's time consuming and annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is meant to misleading Muslims, while yoga us a hindu prayer for them to unit with a god or Gods as they believe, why there's a Muslim woman pictured beside a beard man and kind a back of a clearly feminist creature, your main goal from such an apps is to misguiding people, but your efforts are wasted and you will regret it... Boycott this app specifically for Muslim I mean true Muslim not the misguided ones whose believing in others religion as a lifestyle, as they want you to believe,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even motivates a granny. I'll say more when I've finished."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way too expensive for an app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the first motivational app ever that goes easy on you in the beginning. I'm enjoying it so far. Haven't seen any intrusive ads yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The reason why I don't trust it. Not transparent pricing: I didn't know i signed up for a quarterly subscription . Also, there's a point where it asks for your fingerprint. That feels very scammy. / In response to the reply: It's absolutely NOT clear it's for authentication purposes. For a better UX please ensure its clearer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Careful before you subscribe, I'm spite of I cancelled, money deducted and there is no easy way to cancel the subscription. Still couldn't. I was charged again today with 40 euro. I dont even have the valid account"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have to go through a paid 1 week trial before even starting the app. Should've been the first warning sign, but after cancelling my trial week on the same day I started (app is very busy and incompatible with my ADHD, I felt a bit mislead with the advertisement), I was still charged. I've been unable to reach anyone for a refund. Lots of other apps can give the same service without the risk or cost. I wouldn't recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Initially it was for 1399 per year. Now its 3250 per year. Even now it shows different prices. Its a nice app. But prices. Different prices is the problem now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent program that really keeps me on track toward my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it difficult to cancel, and make it very easy to automatically subscribe. It's very tricky and not a great app either."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Tried to check it out, but man there's a lot of onboarding, even once you get past the initial setup. I just want to see how the app works and what it does. Might be right for some people, but too frustrating to get into the app for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pay walled to even see what the app is about."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Poor experience with the interface ee can't do anything by ourselves it's all forced"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is good. I installed it again in 2024 after two years, and I remember why I deleted it in the first place. The idea of the morning and afternoon routines is good. However, it is not very flexible, and you can't change the settings. The interface is difficult and complicated to use, plus there are so many audio clips to listen to in just one day. It would probably be better to have different options for the membership, such as weekly and monthly, to allow people to try the app for a bit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't trust the developers, app seemed nice enough, but it's really obvious they want my money and nothing else"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Ironically this productivity app is a waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app until every feature became premium. Why market this as a free app? It's not. The free version is basically just a demo because of how many features are limited. It's sad how greedy app developers get."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing this app is without adds and mostly Free of cost"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulous has terrible customer service. I forgot to cancel my subscription and was silently billed $39.99 for another year despite not using it---there were no billing notices sent to my email address. This is predatory towards the customer. I contacted Fabulous customer support, and had to wait more than 2 weeks before I received any response back. I was refused a refund, and Fabulous also refused to modify my subscription to their $3.33 monthly plan, which I could have terminated myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have to pay for anything worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have spent most of my free trial period trying to find out how much this & the companion apps are going to cost me. There is conflicting information all over the place & I've written to support about 5 times, with only one submission getting even an acknowledgement in reply - zero getting an answer. I guess I'll just have to cancel in a couple of days if I can't find out. UPDATE: The response from Dev below is typical. I had been to that page but went again. No help there; no response to email"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam I started the app and paid an ""optional fee"" to start. Then realised after paying that, the app barely gives you anything until a few weeks has passed and your Then forced into paying ¬£34.99 per month. I didn't want to pay that or wait that long so jumped through all of the hoops to cancel my subscription although this is made extremely difficult with the vague and ambiguous terms on their website and help centre. Even though I cancelled the subscription, they still tried to charge me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Poistive start with the app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Effective and fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a terrible company!!!!! I never subscribed to your app and somehow you took my money for your subscription from my account!!! I logged a support ticket to tell you this but your stupid bot keeps telling me I don't have a subscription. How is it that your own system shows I don't have a subscription, yet you steal money from me??? I want my money back as well as the penalties that I have to pay for the 3 previous failed attempts. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The price is worth it they have so many programs in this one app, best thing that ever happened to me ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to use a trial after filling in all your details/goals etc. That was enough to make me uninstall it from a user experience pov."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent apk for students üòéüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Especially because I don't have money to spend on these kind of apps. But with ""Fabulous"" they offered me this app for free as long as I watch an ad a day. Which is something I am absolutely soooo greatful for üôè This app has helped me turn my life into a more positive and active life, making healthy goals and a daily routine for myself, when before all I did was watch TV all day. Thank you ""fabulous"" for helping me change my life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont download this app if you arent looking to pay money. Its not free. Its so ridiculous that nothing nowawadays is built just for the sake of helping others and instead it is about money. Every damn thing is about money nowadays. They also make you pay weekly. I also tried to view the terms and policy of their payment system and it said the document was expired. Red flag."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps you stick with your goals,and gives you a sense of fulfillment as you see your activities getting to an end"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app ever. Give it a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, always have a nice experience using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfecto"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought I was doing a free trial but it charged my card immediately for a whole year. The app has so many pop up features that are overwhelming. The notifications are endless. Even just being on the app is anxiety inducing because it's so busy. Great concept, but I hate the execution."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a paid app beware before providing all your personal info"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not agree with the contract at the start because it had stuff I refused and didn't want in it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am rating this app a 4 because I've only been using it for a week. I love the routines and structure. I have a hard time with self-care and this app is helping me step- (by slow) step."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app deducts 39.99$ automatically and does not refund money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app and tried for 7 day free version. Cancelled the subscription 5 days before actual money for subscription was going to cut, but still amount got debited from account for a year plan!! The app is also not having any info of money getting cut neither is Google play able to provide any info. Bad experience, forcing users to buy plan when they are not ready."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible app, payment needed to utilize function. Definitely scam for personal information. Google needs to remove this from the marketplace as this is a threat to users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'll rate this a 4 start because I want subscription of 1 month as a student."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription during the trial period but was still charged $39.99. I emailed the developer for a refund a week ago but haven't heard back. Bad business model to charge ppl like that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I like it!! Reply:Well, so far, so good!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I liked it however I do not have money so I cannot access more help why not you provide something for people who do not have money but they can do something so they can access full like. Giving features ideas or adding something more helpful or maybe donation features for non profit organization system and etc and I was expecting different features"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is BY FAR my favorite app for self improvement, growth and learning healthy habits. I've used it daily for 1 to 2 yrs now and will continue to :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've used this app years ago when it was free. It's sad that you have to pay now with the upgrades they've done. The added features are helpful to stay on point with task and goals. I also don't like the fact that the branch off/ sister apps you have to pay for as well. It's built into this one like it's included."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Use this app if you like to utterly surrender all sense of agency, work best when micromanaged, and love ignoring the richness and uncertainty of life. Low-threshold behaviourist junk..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good start to building new habits and reinforcing them. My only thing is that it's a slow build-up if you already have some habits in place unless I've missed how to skip or add more without completing the set daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They took my money then gave me nothing. I can only cancel the service on my phone but ""Fabulous"" is still in the trial mode and asks me for money in order to use it. And they will automatically renew. I may need to cancel my PayPal account so that they will stop taking my money. Mistake!!! Don't click Paypal! Don't let the smooth animation pull you in. You can do it! Walk away! Uninstall!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Give us an option to switch off advertisements for your other apps on fabulous, it's distracting, why give advertisements even to your subscribers, please provide an option to switch off those advertisements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An excellent app and fabulous customer care! I subscribed to the premium membership a year ago. It definitely helped me achieve some basic goals and helped me approach habit building in a different way. Unfortunately, my use naturally dropped off after a couple of months. Fast forward a year (to when I'm writing this) and PayPal informs me my subscription has been paid. I'd completely forgotten I still had the app and membership. But within an hour of emailing them, a refund was given."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have only been using this app for a day, but so far I'm loving the art, as well as the rhythmic, calm tone. If I remember in the future, I hope to update this review to reflect a more accurate review of the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not very good, it's like having a clickbait all the time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I would rate it 5 star it is an amazing app love it üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charges you without consent. Even after that it's still trying to sell you multiple other services inside the app. This is a scam. -*Update* Still have not been contacted about my refund request after the 4 business days listed. The request said a ticket was created but there is no identifying number sent to my email. All of this seems designed to make it more and more difficult to both cancel and get your refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lots of tools to help yiu on your journey where ever you are. Great for beginners who have never tried these techniques"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is an encompassing program. Eating, exercise, relaxation, and drinking enough water each day and many other things I haven't discovered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is becoming something interesting and important to me. It's beginning to help, and I can't wait to see where my journey takes me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Genuinely helping!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is one of the best apps on play store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using for a week or so. But so far I'm enjoying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app instantly tries to push you into its paid version before youve even had a chance to get a feel for what you're paying for. Free version is almost entirely unusable - only able to add two tasks to morning routine. Yeah, make yourself a Fabulous new life. As long as you pay up. The app gets 1 star from me for presenting as wholesome and well-natured but then instantly trying to climb into my wallet and then spitefully hiding all of the functionality behind a pay wall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancel my subscription with Fabulous, and two weeks later, they went back into my account and took another annual fee when the first one had not even finished. For me, this app is a scam. You can't talk with anyone, only email which they don't reply to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very well researched app that puts habit building into play. Love it! Could be better if the journey milestones that are shown after you complete a routine went beyond 21 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the fabulous app and how it helps one to slowly start to gradually incorporate small habits into one's life which helps a lot. Thank you, keep at the good work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ask for too much stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great but just three habits for free is really limiting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, I've only been using it for a few days but very impressed so far üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been almost a year of using this app and I have made irreversible changes to my life. All I ask is please please make this app compatible with the pixel watch ü•∫. I know it works for the apple watch but I'm a fan of Google so all my tech is Google. It would change my life even more to have this amazing app on my wrist at all times. Especially when I'm trying to stay off my phone(aka block distractions). Thank you for everything so far! Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I guess it's broken, I can't get past the account setup. I get to where it gives me offers to buy a premium subscription (but I haven't yet found out what this app's features are yet, or seen anything about it, just gave my name and email) and then there's two choices available, ""Continue"" and ""Let Me Explore"". Each button responds visually when I click on it, but nothing ever happens. Tried closing and reopening the app, clearing my cache, nada. I can't get it to work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks for help me to change my life..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great experience...it's like having personal mentor to guide and support in day to day well beingness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I won't pay for a service like this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It forced me to pay in the 7 day trial :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thanks for telling me at the beginning that it costs money. I don't like giving my information first and then get told..oh, by the way, we need your credit card."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"auto renews. Very difficult to cancel. Intrusive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really find it motivating, and I'm not one of those people who it has usually gone in for stuff like this. My only complaint is that I'm super poor and it's super expensive but they do seem to be trying to account for that. I wish they had a scholarship program LOL"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this has honestly been one of the only helpful apps for my adhd. the rewards are small enough to want more, but not too small to make you wanna quit. mini stories/movies everytime you complete a goal keep things interesting and interactive. i don't think i never commented on another app before, this thing works THAT f-ing good‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using the Fabulous app for about 1 week now and I'm really excited about it. I'm still discovering all it has to offer, believe me it seems like it's endless. You can start with small goals, set alarms, listen to meditations, choose exercises, it's truly amazing! I highly recommend this very useful and interactive program!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The whole process of starting this is a chore, I wanted to try this to quicky improve things but to set up all the constant contract, payment, suggestions etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great accountability partner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty good, but you have to put the work in for it to work for you. The app does keep asking for a review even if you've given one..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Reminds me to do the little thing's. It's like how a good friend would support you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"paid $5 for nothing! completed all the questions and app went blank unable to continue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Relaxing fun and informative ~"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok so far. Why do apps push to be rated so early on in the install. Its annoying. Then when you do rate it doesn't go away"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great to keep me on a good path"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only worked a month. Paid a year. Please stop sending me free months. I'm not using the year I paid for. Ugh."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just changed a few habits and have lost 12lbs in less than 2 weeks by literally starting these habits. My life was so disorganised and chaotic. I'm now building the foundations of a peaceful calmer life thanks to fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires email"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why are they asking for a thumbprint??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a few days in and sooooo presently surprised. I'm excited to dig deeper."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APP. Customer service is nonexistent, if there is a problem you will have to fight tooth and nail to get any help. And even after you cancel your subscription, a year later they will pull money off your card! Can you say fraudulent charges?? Have to go through hell and back to talk to a person and they won't work with you so you have to file a charge back with your card company. AVOID FABULOUS AT ALL COSTS!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"2024 update; you tried to charge a debit card even after not canceling a badly described yearly sub and ZERO support for a product that was sold as an extra that provided no value. The absolute worst support and company. 2023 review: my wife installed and paid for the custom pdf that was little more than a questionnaires answers regurgiated into pdf. The ""coach"" was an overworked person that did not even read the pdf to begin with. Autosubscription and paid service with ZERO value. UNINSTALL."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE. Their app is a fraud. I had to get Mastercard involved last year with them because they will charge you 49.99 for a PDF that a computer compiles together that they consider ""Coaching."" Spoiler alert: That's not coaching- that's automation. Asked for a refund and was declined. I was ignored by customer service AND the CEO. Now they're charging me AGAIN and I had to cancel my card and submit it as fraud so that they won't have my data. GET OUT OF MY LIFE FABULOUS!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Day number 4 and I'm living it, loving it, and making a change.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Smart, deep, strong, great graphics, sound, fun! Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm really getting use our of and enjoying the app, however I really wish you all would select which voice is reading your coaching to you. For the first couple of weeks I found that I was getting coaching from English gentleman & now the app is more often swapping him out for the female voice, and as pleasant as she is, I find her voice distracting. She sounds like a pharmaceutical commercial voice over actor. The other guy is soothing and I feel the coaching aren't as effective without him."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AMAZING"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is wonderfully designed and I do enjoy using it but... I work third shift. A more customizable approach to when a day ""ends"" would be appreciated, as the two options of 2am the next day or midnight just isn't realistic for me. 2am is my 2pm and you wouldn't consider that the ""end"" of your day, would you?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is far too cluttered and distracting. not personal enough. I do not need to be told what routines I should be doing. I want the app to organise the components of my life currently into routines to benefit me and give me a good schedule. I already am in the habit of drinking water (4.5l daily) and regular exercise (2x daily). I still want to have a better schedule and implement routines for less common factors. It just seems like one big distraction for people who want to focus"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has changed my life. I now have routine and structure in my life, Fabulous has so much to it, I'm learning new and healthier habits and letting go of old unhealthy ways. It's like my support system whenever I need it. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm using this as a cheerleader in transforming my life to 100% positive, step by step"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I'd have brought premium if I could afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a good tracker for healthy habitsüëåüèªapproved and stamped"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deliberately designed to make sure you have no idea about subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really makes it easier to get up in the morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Update: I've now used the app for over a year and still love it! Update: after a few more weeks I have achieved so much and am feeling great about life! The app keeps me on track and accountable. It also brings new ideas into the mix. This works folks! It might be on the expensive side but it's truly worth every cent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I easily sleep with Fabulous stories"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They want you to pay $40 AFTER asking 500 questions and you still have to set your own goals. Simpler way is to set your own alarms"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Used a free trial last year (Jan 2023), canceled within a week, then this year (Jan 2024) got billed for a premium account. Don't have an account, and none of my email addresses or Google addresses let me log in to an account. SCAM EDIT: and before your automod comes in and does customer PR by saying go check the website and contact for help. I HAVE. Not a word out of your scamming practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app needs a dark mode option. I can see they put a lot of thought into the UI, not having the dark mode seems like a major blunder. Excited about the app contents tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The only problem is price"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I been having a bad habits after the garentine and this app makes me better than ever, I got compliment by a lot of people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unethical billing practices with no customer support. App is not very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting and it helps me a lot to heal and be my best version of myself everyday in just a realistic and kind steps with this app's guidance and approach."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it! Other economical options with same functionality available."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great! It helps motivate me and it's not very demanding to do the journeys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just updating my review as I didn't get any response. I want to try trial version and it deduct one year fees automatically. Customer service on play store refer to there official side. I contacted them and they requested for transaction proof. Since then they vanished like scammers. Application is not good and deducting money like scammers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Confusing to figure out and way too many notifications and ads. It is very hard to figure out how to cancel premium membership and that left a particularly bad taste in my mouth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can barely do anything for free, for me being young it's hard finding good apps like this. At first my hopes got high because I thought maybe it would be a generous app and have a decent about of free features, but nope. As soon as I 'personalized' my account it asked me for money. I can't even add more then one routine to something without having to pay. It's dumb, I might as well use Google Calendar instead."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very friendly, he can be a good friend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a wonderful app I'm slowly. Getting new habits and I'm really getting better I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me have new hobbies and getting used to it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Is not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After answering a bunch of private questions and then let you know it cost money to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I mostly enjoy Fabulous! I think I might be missing out on parts of it, though, because there isn't a dark mode. Reading text on a white background, even large print, us difficult and painful, so I find myself skipping a lot of the pages and the groups entirely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me a lot to improve my motivation every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Use Fabulous app for a long time and really like it but a journey 'A Fabulous night' disappointed me. So many repetitive information, overwhelming motivators and one-time actions, letters and goals don't connect with each other (e.g. letter ‚Ññ4 tells about disconnection from the phone and determines gratitude as a goal) Please, make it more structured"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel that you are my friend. Thank you for being here! Hope to go with you everyday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I truly love this out anytime I want to try to do better it really helps me a whole lot and I thank you guys but the only thing I have a problem with is a lot of the questions you can't read them all it's like part of its hidden. There's writing on top of writing can you fix that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life and it keeps changing it...helping me develop new habit,have peaceful sleep,plan and organize my work.Theres a lot i can say now i can say I'm living my fabulous life‚ù§.I recommend it for you if you want to live a fabulous healthy lifestyle‚ù§üé∂üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only been on fir a day but feeling really good about sticking to it!üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it very difficult to cancel your subscription and get a refund. I got charged 60$ for one on one coaching I did not want. And now I don't think I can get any refunds. I just threw away like 100$ please be aware."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"14-01-2014 I PURCHASED 1 YEAR SUBSCRIPTION PLAN IN DECEMBER 2023 NOW IT SHOW I HAVE NO ACTION SUBSCRIPTION. AFTER CLICKING ON RESTORE 16-01-2024 Edit :- All I get in response is. My favourite app support is super trast --------------------------- You started Fabulous Premium, but then you decided to quit. This means that we've made a mistake, and we take complete responsibility for it. When you, Harsh, decided that Fabulous Premium wasn't for you, it meant that we've failed our mission."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Me a ayudado a mejorar en mis h√°bitos y a conocer nuevos para que sirven y como me pueden ayudar,La funci√≥n de las cartas es muy √∫til dan recomendaciones y ayudan con la motivaci√≥n, el √∫nico defecto que veo es que en mi caso yo tengo el idioma en espa√±ol pero me enter√© que en la versi√≥n en ingl√©s tiene m√°s funciones y opciones que no est√°n en la versi√≥n de Espa√±ol, pagu√© la versi√≥n premium de la app y no me parece que ni siquiera me deje acceder a esa funciones aunque cambie a ingl√©s"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It looks great, and I was looking forward to working w it-- but I wasn't getting push notification reminders of tasks/habits. Got no follow-up on how it was working for me. -For those of us who aren't digital natives, it was frustrating. I sent a msg before free trial ended that I wanted to cancel, and why. No response. But they still charged my account. I sent another msg. No response. Looks like it's just a freaking AI program and ""no humans at home."" -It's all sbout the $$ - not helping us."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"As it's name it's really Fabulous.....Very useful. MUST TRY."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a couple of days into using this app but it feels uplifting and comforting. It's a lovely source of gentle positive reinforcement throughout the day. Very easy to navigate and use, too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I never even got a chance for the free trial, it charged me right away, same day as I signed up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just on day one but so far I'm loving it. . . Im hoping to keep the positive impact going . . . Will update after the 1st week . . Did really well with app but just costly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Canceled my subscription last year because I wasn't using the app, and I just got charged again. Haven't had the app for a long time now. It's a helpful tool, but it just wasn't for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It's all to easy and way too common to set yourself a goal and then fail for any number of reasons - boredom, daunted by scale of task ahead, etc. This app breaks it down into manageable segments and motivates and encourages you along the way while gradually increasing your target. It starts you off slowly, but not too slowly, and doesn't allow you to dive straight in and select an insane amount of things you want achieved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have not found the app useful. I consider that lacks a sense of direction that is adjustable to every individual. It just throws you advise to you, regardless if it is applicable or not. Also, I have been trying to cancel without success, as how to cancel was not made clear. I ended up being charged without any chance of refund. I would recommend other apps that meet all I mentioned above."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a helpful app. It is supporting me to build up habits that are good for me and the daily coaching, although slightly irritating in tone often have useful quotes or insights that I can apply. What I struggle with is the slight inflexibility. For example with morning exercise, as a woman, when I have a period there are days when exercise may not be an option or if, like today, I have an injury or simply have chosen to exercise later. There is no space to acknowledge this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to love the app before, and I fell in love with it even more after they allowed me to help support it by watching ads to access premium features, however this feature was removed and now I don't even know how to continue using it (especially since the few things it allows can be done with a planner and other more focused apps). Honestly Fabulous helped me start my journey, but now that I need more tools to continue improving I have found it lacking, please bring back being able to see ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It calms me down..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app so far, the only thing that would make it better is widgets that can display my routines without opening the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Getting me up in the morning and finally getting myself fixed up for adulthood"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is awesome for achieving my goal of waking up and drinking water"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for the premium subscription without any reminder or warning. The do not inform this before activating the free trial. I need a refund for my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is truly Fabulous and it's realistic. Made for real people with real life struggles. I highly recommend giving it a chance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still trying out the app. Trying to establish the first five habits. I don't follow them in the precise way, as I don't find exercise good for me in the morning, so I just put on music and dance around with my kitties. It is going well so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful in establishing habits and routines. The reward system is very motivating, and I like the daily and nightly coaching. It's becoming the best part of my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app Is especially helpful For Those Having difficulty In finding structure I am updating my previous review. This used to be a very helpful app, however they have added so many add ons it takes away from the simplicity. I will be unsubscribing and no longer recommending this app as a useful tool for those struggling with finding structure. They try to sell too many products and someone with ADHD OR PTSD, looking for a tool to help focus and bring back a routine, this will make things worse"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a fraud app. Does not allow you to unsubscribe. You go to settings and manage subscription and it will take you back to home page. No way to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I can't go ahead from email request, the continue button is shaded"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying fabulous. The simple tasks are actually very helpful. I loved the drinking water first thing in the morning. It is amazing how this simple task can make such a difference"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update! I've reached out for assistance on the website and it's a bot that doesn't help. I've gotten through to submitting a ticket twice some days ago but still haven't received anything further to help.Company is trash! No option for monthly payment! I want my money back. Tried to contact them and they denied my refund. App is definitely not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The daily motivation and encouragement is just what I need to get back into a routine while taking care a newborn and recently retiring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is good. It persistently pushes you to achieve what you want to in do in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far! I usually try for goals that are too big when it comes to goal setting. Fabulous helps out with this. The stories are great and inspiring!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an update and my third year with the app. I still love it. It eases you in and is flexible and has a LOT of great encouragement and inspiration and advice and guidance. This jump-starts my day and pushes me into a purposeful mindset. I highly recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent application which charges you and doesn't even return the money. The documentation is way too complicated to understand and proceed. Rather than helping with your ADHD it will just make you more overwhelmed. Other than that thier contact support does not work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just a few words... I could easily show you many reasons ... but today is the end of day three since starting this and I'm loving it. So positive, and helping me prioritize myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Starting to enjoy the goals and the pings"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best routine app mananger"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am literally grateful that this app exists."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just amazing it helped me so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just started can't tell yet"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fun and whimsical while keeping me on track. I like that I can read the coaching sessions or have them read to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic tool to revisit the way you start or end your day. Form healthier habits by being accountable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for habit formation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would give negative stars if I could. This app is the single worst experience I have ever had with a trial of something. The initial experience is designed to be very confusing so as to push people into signing up for premium. Getting out of premium is even more unclear, and even after closing my account with them they continue to spam my inbox daily trying to get me to sign up for coaching and premium. Stay away from this company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good for change life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app To make change more doable and fun. Very rewarding and calming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After Uninstalling and reinstalling this app a bunch I found found why it didn't work, i was rushing it! This app has the perfect guide to slowly work on your goals one task at a time, stick with your one goal and slowly make it two, or three, or more!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this üíñüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only 7 day trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged without notification through their obscure website after being ""gifted"" the service through a friend. They did not make the billing clear and charged me for TWO separate apps. Trying to dispute the charge was impossible as their text refund bot didn't work (surprise). I have loved this app before but their billing practices this time were shady and a VERY expensive 80$ scam. I always recommended this app before but now am very wary of it. So sad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Thus far, the app is decent. I enjoy the routines and how they guide you through it. The UI is obviously beautifully designed. They very much push their other apps on you, though. Where it is not self-evident that that other app is not included in your premium subscription (talking about Clarify ADHD). So, sometimes, it feels a like they just aim to get more from you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The great disappointment. I don't recommend this app at all. Exceedingly rigid in setting goals. Pricy. Help desk is unresponsive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's actually helping me build better habits. I used to wake up at 4 p.m but now I wake up before noon"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: I wish I had never tried Fabulous. When signing up for what I thought was a free trial, I actually got charged $16.41 for a ""14 day intro,"" which I wasn't even aware of until I saw the charge on my PayPal account. I am in the process of trying for a refund, but have low hopes as Fabulous intentionally obfuscates the refund process and makes it impossible to figure out how to contact somebody without going through the app, which is deleted on my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun little thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good deal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really fabulous...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"its a cute lil app and the idea of its cool but it's not as flexible as I thought it would be with the goals and stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying the app so far. Downloaded it to help me achieve my new year's resolutions and form better habits. You do have to pay for it to get any real use out of it. The only thing that I don't like is the fact there is a bunch of apps connected to it (that can help you lose weight, work on adhd, etc.) But you have to pay for them all! They're all $40 which would get really expensive fast. I feel like once you pay for the main one you should be able to access features to the rest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cloyingly cumbersome. Seemed like a great app until I bought it. Now it feels like a prekindergarten forced journey to learn my ABCs. If you lack patience for fluff, this is not the app for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish apps would just flat out have a ""buy"" button on the play store instead of finding out after like 5-10mins of answering questions that I have to pay for this. üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòë"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They have made it extremely difficult and confusing to cancel the subscription. Don't fall for it. I received a payment notice and actually had to set up an account just to cancel the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a very fabulous app ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, encouraging, and positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app surely deserves 5 stars for the content it provides but can you please bring back the old feature when one used to get premium subscription for a day by watching an ad? Only if I could really afford Fabulous, I'd have loved to. But I'm a full-time student who is tight with her expenses. I would love to see the change for good. Thank you Fabulous Team :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best investments I made for myself. My favourite part is the vocal messages in the morning and at night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No me deja abrirla. Dice que no responde, etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is nothing like what I read before getting app or what is available for free isn't what is listed in app store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very anti consumer. It is deceptively easy to start a subscription with automatic renewal. Additionally the support is very non cooperative in giving refunds. Typical subscription trap but this time with the click of a button."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have not used fabulous app since 2021 and cancelled subscription at that time so I'm no longer a customer. The help centre doesn't give options for refund on ex customers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too many features locked behind a paywall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Effective - very guided or customizable - something for everyone. I build my kids routines and my own."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the introductory week of premium with the expectation of a notification letting me know my account would be charged. I got no notification and a charge for an app I don't want."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent interaction with the users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very cute, a community full of supporting and optimistic people. I'm not the best at forming habits, but this kind of helps :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely the best self help app I have seen so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app has great features and robust content. It's very structured and a bit difficult to find what works for you. I lost motivation after about 3 months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Trying this out. So far I like the self set pace of habit building. Let's see"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There is very little flexibility on what I can make my goals as. Going to stick with excel and a planner for keeping tabs on my progress instead"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded but was nothing like the preview pictures show. And asked all kinds of questions but then you need to pay before you use. Was hoping it was a planner like advertised in photos."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Helps me to stay focus and study!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like how it slows you down and makes you build habits one at a time-- usually when I try, I think of everything I want to do, which is impossible, and then I get discouraged and do nothing. This makes you start with just drinking water when you wake up for 3 days in a row. It reframed goal setting for me--I'm only 1 week in but I've never done a morning routine for an entire week and this has actually made it so easy,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still 5 star üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Without those micro transaction it's gonna be perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app about 10 years ago and I loved it and it was totally free, unfortunately I can't use it because my country bans using visa for foreign currencies which us such a disappointment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much it awsime it so relaxing calm üòåunlike other appos"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am on day 3, and I am taking baby steps to get to my goals. I felt like giving up already, but I didn't want to let the app down and miss any of my daily routine üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app clearly uses targeted marketing. The images that appear in the ads are specific to my likes and needs, but those are nowhere in the app. It asks specifically if you have or think you have ADHD thinking that it will be a tailored simplified experience, but the amount of pop ups, graphics and sections is way too overwhelming. It's so segmented and geared towards having you sign up for more apps. Very discouraging. It's a good idea but this app seems like a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've never actually committed to any self care plans but this mught be the one yall <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoyed the free trial period"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helps to set you up with healthy routines and habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"can't cancel when didn't have subscription. keeps taking or trying to take my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I wanted to try this app and the first thing it asked was for my fingerprint. I wasn't comfortable with sharing that. So uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT subscribe to ""free"" trial for Premium! They trick you into subscribing, then unsubscribing is a nightmare! It's confusing on purpose! 1) you have to find your subscription, 2) you need to confirm that you want to unsubscribe 4 times! After choosing to unsubscribe, then confirming... you still need to scroll through irrelevant offers, till the very bottom of the page, to click a button to unsubscribe two more times! I thought I unsubscribed, but they charged me! No refund either! So angry!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fabulous app üòç it's the best ever One more thing, i hope if you can add automatic downloading of resources, it will be easier for some resources when my phone rest in offline mode."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi fabulous, I have just had 8430 naira taken out of my account. I was not sent a reminder email to say I was going to be billed. I have sent a refund message. Please I need my money back. Pleaseeee"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Promising. But so so complicated to use that it put me off. It could have been streamlined to make it simpler to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I would give it 1 star but to be fair I haven't gotten far enough into it to know for sure if it's as bad as I think it is. A 7 day trial is not enough to know if you want to subscribe to it for a year. It is pretty pointless so far. My only task for days was drinking water, which I already do. Then eating breakfast, which I already do. I don't need to subscribe to an app for that. And now my trial is up before I have seen it if can do anything else."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Feels like a scam. Why do you need to know where the account was created to cancel it? Why can't I cancel it in the app? Why do I have to pay for a test run and then why do you automatically charge when the not-free trial is over? I'm not saying I didn't sign up for it but for the purposes of a review. The app is stupid and all those other things that feel scammy don't help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Well.. everything is fabulous if you comply. Everything is fabulous if you are cattle and do only what the app thinks is beneficial for you. What if I want to bring my own knowledge about myself into the mix. What if I have my own goals, my own challenges, my own actions to keep track off? UPDATE: One more thing, notifications don't property work: I click on them and nothing happens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please don't take subscription guys it's scam. App is very bad and when you try to cancel subscription it doesn't let you. They have charged me for a whole year. Please be careful guys."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Annoying and doesn't let you take control"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has been really beneficial for me and my attempt to create a healthy life style"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice but it have to recharge for more better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch, app is not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A nice concept but not fit for people who work different shifts everyday... I may work early morning shifts one week and then the next day I will work night shift for several weeks... The set timings don't really work when it will remind me to put a glass of water on my nighstand at 9 pm. At that time I'll be in the middle of work .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Company is shady. Don't want to do a manual refund to me when ive nv used at all. email them and they do not reply me anymore cos they dont wanna refund. Here's wat they say 'Although we truly understand your situation and frustration, I'm sorry to say that unfortunately we won't be able to proceed with a refund for your purchase.' DAMN SHADY COMPANY. It's jus a matter of doing a manual refund to people who have no interest at all. USE IT WITH CAUTION"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfect if you ar trying to make your life better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Poor app experience in that the app leads down a lengthy induction phase which amounts to very little progress. Plus the app is really very busy and graphic heavy which suggests it hides behind this with poor functionality. Pair this with the poor patronising customer service received after enquiring about a refund. There are so many apps that are out their to provide a good genuine service, I'm afraid this does not seem to be one of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! It helps you take small steps that can make a positive change in your life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It help me reject all of my bad habits and its a good app thanks fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Everyday I'm exploring and finding new things I didn't know we're on the app. Everything is relevant and uplifting. Over all It's been a fabulous experience. Pun intended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Although I liked the concept of the app & the way it was handled, this app is sort of scammy. It states you have multiple payment options to choose from but at the end of the day it forces the annual payment up front. Support was no help either (see comment below) to ensure my subscription was charged monthly rather than yearly upfront. If only they took the time to troubleshoot this issue, my decision would be different. Given the time with the app & no change I'm choosing to use something else"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Feeling energized and comport the way Spoken pitch so harmonious. It gave the end user to recover."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It says it has a free trial to ""pay what you want"" but you have to select one of their preset amounts the lowest of which is $1. This is neither free nor my choice. Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam, they charge you for stupid things and without refunds. They sent me a banner for a coach subscription. And made you pay for it because you missed click a button. Bad app, I really hate it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"After getting all my data first thing you ask for is money.. üòè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is incredible! I have been stalled out for the better part of 6 months and NOTHING was getting me back on track. And I have always been a perfectionist, thinking to myself that if you can't do it right you shouldn't do it at all. I can't believe how much this app has changed me, it's been a lifesaver!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do you have to name it a morning ritual sounds more religious than calling it a routine that's some of the reasons I uninstalled the app that's being biased"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Maybe it's a good app for someone, but not for me. I want to determine my new habits myself. Drink water in the morning? I do that every day because I'm thirsty. And I don't need to mess around with it for three days of the trial version. Also, I don't do it immediately when I wake up because I breastfeed my child first, but I do it at the first opportunity! I have no idea who on this planet doesn't do that... I need something that would support MY goals and not a dictator on my smartphone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Falling for u. I am sorry. Forgive me. I don't mean as stated in your email. In fact, I really like these apps, very helpful in my situation which is currently very complicated, one body, one house, one relationship, both external and internal. These apps really help me. You deserve a thumbs up! Keep up the fight, keep up this effort and please don't go half way, it helps me a lot. I want to start falling yesterday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"About 10 minutes of setting it up only for it to require a $40/year subscription to use the app. Free trials are a scam that are difficult to cancel and end up charging you anyway. Avoid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"While not a panacea, this helps focus my day and gives me direction. Small steps in the same direction will cover great distances."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried to auto load itself into my phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"a terrible UX design hiding behind a good looking Ui Design. To even dare and pretend this app helps with ADHD shows exact3how clueless the devs are."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Initial difficulty (due to using my work email address) that lead to the inability to access the membership through the app. I couldnt change the email without accessing the app, or cancel. So i got billed twice and never used it. I tried multiple times to reach someone for help but got no response. The email address was receiving emails from the fabulous with offers about prem membership too (confusing!). A useful and well built app but felt like I was trapped in a subscription. Yuck."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The fact that I get reminded and motivated is the gig for me. I also enjoy the step by step guide. I'm always looking forward to another talk. I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a great app for building habits. As a psychologist, I appreciate the support of established principles in behavior change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only 3 days in. Hoping I stick to it. Kind of sucks that it costs money but it lets me pay $4 a month so it's not so bad. You definitely want to explore all the setting in it and allow it to notify you and remind you about things. Otherwise I'd forget. Great for keeping organized."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its a bit expensive app, but it gives me something small to do every day. It has achievable goals and I just LOVE to listen to the adventure stories and support stories that come every day. Short and simple stories perfect on the bus to work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont download it's terrible. Hard to navigate. It behaves like a 2000s computer virus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Super disappointed in this app. I wanted a self help, peaceful energy app but this is just bootleg social media. Even after signing up for premium the app did everything possible to advertise things and try to keep me on the app to the point of putting their own stuff in my daily checklist. Every time I clicked anything I would get 5 pop ups about things I don't care about. Very unprofessional and not what anyone is looking for. Ended up just downloading a regular free check list app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waste of my time going through the set up just to find out there is no free level. I'll find something else to try free and upgrade if it's worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"At the moment, I am enjoying the app. It gives a great aesthetic pleasure and I like the fact that I have something to guide me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The dumb app doesn't even have ""Pray to God,"" something many Americans do to start their day. Definitely an app for those with no purpose in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and great reminders throughout the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An app that helps me to unwind and regenerate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm unsure if there's an actual way to contact a customer service representative. I had my credit card flag my renewal. I verify purchase with my credit card and was asked to run card again. I attempted to contact customer service to requested my card be run again and I received a email that my account was cancelled at my request. That's not what I had requested. I was offered an additional 30 day free trial to return but I'm frustrated at the moment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just couldn't give this app a chance. It requires an email for spam messages, then you are bombarded with a premium offer which you need to say ""no"" to 4 times, then tons of questions regarding my morning routine, what I want from the app etc. and the suggested task for my morning routine was a checklist to drink water when I wake up and that's all. Then when I want to try the daily tasks routine it's the tons of questions again with the super slow and annoying animations. It's a waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary. Not useful. It suitable for who has extra Time or who is free always."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have had the app for a while and kept putting it off, and i was recieving positive messages about being stuck and i just started with baby steps and i am starting to feel positive about the rutine, i actully felt good today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty smooth app, very helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Really wish this was accessibility friendly so I don't have to turn off certain accessibility settings just to use this app. I think I tried this app in 2019 or 2020 When I first discovered it and had to quit because of that. At least 3 years passed with no change. Quite disappointing I'd say :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It truly is fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"supper"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I cannot describe just how amazing this app is! It's great with helping you develop routines, right now there's an offer if you sign up for ¬£35 for lifetime use. Definitely worth looking at as it's usually ¬£200+!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I decided to change my life this year, and this app already helped me to make a routine for myself and.it guides me well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seems like a good idea, but the ""free"" version is completely unusable. When you click on anything seemingly offered it's just an ad for the paid version. Very agressively pushing you to pay for the full app at each click, and giving you ultimatum discount (once a year offer) before giving you any opportunity to even open and try anything in the app. Very greedy and disrespectful. Why even have a ""free"" version when it's nothing but a downloaded ad... Not even worth the time to install."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app very positive fun to follow. I needed to wait because I feel I'm to much to thin to spread out any further. Thanks though for time. Connie"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think the app really works. Getting a 7 day premium and on the first day 30 day premium gift cards (without affiliate link) is weird though. Seems like I could have signed up with the 30 day link instead, if only I had one? First week done, going to see if the app is useful without premium subscription. I read that people gladly pay for it, as will I when I keep using it (always tend to pay for free apps I use a lot). Edit: stopped using, as premium is a must and it didn't take for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app ever. I love it so much, thank you, Favulouse.üòä‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The thing I needed right now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it, so far. Has definitely helped steer my mind in the right direction. üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There's a big bug where the draw over apps takes over the entire screen and I can't do anything except system commands like home and back, and I have to restart my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app collected my data first and then they want money. They should tell us first that this is not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app! just the timer should be put on as a notification as well while performing the manually added tasks in the particular shcedule"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"4 stars because all features are not free ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"to much focus and restraints from the premium memberships"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the basic features. But hate the coaching and persistent coaching. It interrupts you so often that I ignore it. And as a result miss many reminders. I think I'm going back to standard google reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice Build app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do these apps all need fingerprints? I Uninstalled cause of it. And what's up with all the questions?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Consistent encouragement has been making it easier to keep up with my goals. I just wish the notifications were more noticeable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muy linda app, aunque me gustar√≠a que estuviera en espa√±ol tambi√©n :c"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have improved myself üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a terrific app that has helped me build great habits for a few years."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm not trying to watch a bunch of loading animations I just want to put my tasks on a list"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overly aggressive. No option to proceed unless do what they want even if you know that will produce a negative effect for yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"–°–∞–º–æ–µ –±–µ—Å—è—á–µ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app upon my first time using today, will add points in the future. For now please add a dark mode setting for the app. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded app. Subscribed via app to do trial. Can't unsubscribe via play store - charged me for a year. Not fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am experiencing quite a bit of transformation using this app. Developing habits. Creating a new mindset. Gaining clarity and focus. All are helping me with my personal goals of exercise, healthy eating, decluttering, and prioritizing my Self-Care. I honestly can not stop raving enough about it. The daily motivators, the checklists & the nightly coaching sessions I am all in. Slow progression with constant positive reinforcement is creating a NEW me! Thank You!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow this is a very good app...helps with anything everything...I really highly recommend it to people who are having troubles trying to figure out they're lives or just even if you don't have problems...I just don't like that every time you want more habits it wants you to pay but you can be smart like me and just clear the whole payment thing and it still works... FABULOUS IS THE BEST"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Oh boy, where do I start on what makes this system so irksome? Is it the way that the system is set to strong arm you into setting a goal regardless of whether that's something you struggle with? Is it the unskippable sanctimonious monologues that you have to slog through? Is it the near impossible task of cancelling the subscription? Is it that while this app may be many things designed for people with ADHD certainly isn't one of those things? Or maybe it's all that and more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 stars if free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful in setting goal anf a daily reminder of task (habbits) and motivational coaching and encouraging speeches to implement changes to your daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I think idea is good because i have seen it first time in any app, but it was a waste of time for me, first they welcome you on app, Ask questions about yourself and your daily habbits, building up for you and then after all the things after motivating they just show their popup of Free trial or Exit the app Advice : Atleast give users little time to explore app and its funtionalities initially then ask if they want to use the app then u can ask all those questions and show them Trial/exit optn."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*edited to add one month later* this app charged me AGAIN! A SECOND BILLING AND CHARGE for ANOTHER year subscription! Omg they just keep chqeging me every month for a year long subscription! RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM AND ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD Cancelled auto renew in the Play store a long time ago, but somehow it still auto renewed without my authorization. Have contacted customer service twice with no response. Please cancel my subscription and issue my refund ASAP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its goood!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to like this app so bad but i couldn't even get pass the set up without feeling like it was a scam lol. They give you a 5 minute personal quiz, set up your profile with email, make you promise to a little ""contract"" for you to embark on this ""journey"" that you have to enable USING YOUR FINGERPRINT. All of this BEFORE telling you that it's a 2 week trial. Yikes upon yikes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app, and it is a great tool for motivation and developing great habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful I hope people would try this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another Fabulous user PO'd about water! I DON'T NEED AN APP TO TELL ME TO DRINK WATER, and having to wait 3 days for a paid service to tell me something OTHER than to drink water is BS. I shouldn't have to wait 3 days to establish any goals. My goals should matter from the start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"too many hidden ‚úÖÔ∏è that are for accepting additional fees and upgrades. Very sneaky! Focus on what the app is for and maybe people would stay but you ask for money in first 2 minutes and continue to keep asking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I started using Fabulous as I get it free through my benefits package at work. It's early days, hence the 3 stars, but I will revisit my rating in a few weeks once I have more experience with the app. So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has truly helped me create new habits and is an oasis in the world of tech that shines with support, encouragement, positivity and genuine caring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am trying to activate 30 days trial , when selecting gpay it's still asking card details"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! It helps me to stay focused and mindful. It's about self care, meditation, mindfulness, and goals to complete. There is a list of ""habits"" that you choose from and can even customize. What I like about the app best is that if there is a habit you want to complete, you can choose one from their list and label it to include your specific habit that you want to have!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When u download it, it lets you create a profile, asks for your email, and then asks you to pay for the app. It's very misleading. Don't download if you're looking for a free app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many things have to pay for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"too much fluff! as someone with ADHD I'm not fighting with forced interactions to advance to the actual trackers. The contract signing thing was unnecessary and ridiculously annoying, uninstalled after that screen immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started app and I already love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app, but iys almost impossible to do anything without paying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would give -1 stars, if possible. The app sneaked a premium membership without consent. My bank app noticed the fraudulent money movement and instantly blocked the card. This behaviour is shameful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The flow chart advertisement is what got me to hooked to try this app but that feature is nowhere in this app. I really hate mobile app advertising."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Basically a scam. Did not find it useful but the worst part was it was incredibly hard to cancel their paid plan (actually it's impossible through the app, you have to go through a tedious process on their website). And it's also basically impossible to contact support as far as I can tell. The 'contact us' just leads to automated responses. Avoid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Are you kidding with the noise?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fablous as completely changed my life. I been slowly becoming a better person. This works much greater than daylio. I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeping me on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is life changing. I have ADHD and the reminders, the intuitive layout and the graphics make it a pleasure to be finally learning how to achieve my goals for each day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate it so much. so confusing. things popping up all over the place."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only 3 days into this app, but the coaching messages and the way the app builds new routines with baby steps is wonderful. I don't feel overwhelmed or defeated, and I am looking forward to a better me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraud fraud fraud ... Forcefully deducted amount for premium, even I had cancelled much earlier. No way you can get easy way to get it refunded. Neither from Google Play Store not from fabulous. Its Hazardous than fabulous. Please don't install this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"dont like the graphics Illuminati arts that u mean you control people as you like you them a goal by force and people cant set thier goals but after 3 days like why"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ú®I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH FABULOUS, üíû IT HAS HELPED ME ASKING IN MY JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE üíó CHANGING & EVOLVING INTO THE BESTEST ‚ù§Ô∏è VERSION OF MYSELF.. .

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app has a deceptive way of charging and you do not know how you are being charged until it hits your account. You are not able to easily cancel without logging into their website. You cannot handle this from app. I had to try and finish setting up an account even though I had used it for a few days, to try and cancel and even then I could not. Evem their help instructions are not helpful. Get a planner and get some discipline.yourself. Do not try this app. Big money pit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I actually really love the app, I'm surprised!!! it's a really cool assistant ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app would be so great if you could do multiple goals. I'm stuck in drinking water which is not my focus rn. Not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ad looks and is nothing like the app. smells like a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's all right so far. Haven't fully gotten into the groove and the presentation format is a bit of a turn-off, but they do well at toeing the line between keeping you engaged and keeping you off the app, although I'd prefer they leaned a bit more towards the latter."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DON'T GET THE APP!!! . They take your money whether you cancel before the end of your subscription or not. Dailight robbery. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You have to pay for this app But I live in Iran and I can't pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"APP RECOMMENDED BY FRIEND! IHAD SOME GLITCHES! IT TOOK OVER 30 DAYS TO GET A RESPONSE!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not use their free trial. You cannot cancel at any time you have to cancel more than 24 hours from the charge date if you don't want to be charged. They will also not refund you the money even though they waited over 5 days from when I attempted to cancel to when they actually charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a nice app. I can set bedtime and wakeup routine and drinking water and breakfast etc. But the main problem is this app still have premium membership and I don't want to subscribe for premium I'll give only 4.8 stars because there are no new update came in this app but this is a nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am building healthy habits step by step"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's got some good points and I like the functionality, but it's rendered borderline unusable for me by the rigidity in the ""journeys"". My personal history has left me with a very precarious relationship to exercise and diet, and so I can't even progress past the third item in the initial journey unless I accept a ""goal"" to start working out every morning. Fabulous refuses to treat users like adults who can choose what works for them. It's their way or the highway. Guess I'll take the highway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I definitely didn't like it. It seems to work only if you go premium. If not, you only have a few and boring options. I didn't even understand how it works. It's so confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm starting to feel like this app is a waste if you have ADHD. It's making me feel even worse that I'm failing my routines every day and not improving. The coaching gets very repetitive and boring as well. I don't know if that's because I'm stuck not making progress or there is so little content."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it is a big joke of an app! I have to get you a very negative review!! you have made the transaction on my app, without even asking my permission to do so! Twice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app was life changing. It starts with a tiny seemingly random habit but it truly becomes the building block for all the other habits you'd like to incorporate into your life. I never dreamed I'd be waking up at 5am to exercise but here I am and I am so happy with this journey. This app is brilliant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I had the premium membership for a year and wanted to renew it but there was an issue with the payment. I contacted customer service to change payment method and they deleted my subscription completely! After a few months I receive a payment receipt but can't access my premium membership. I have contacted the customer services many times but no answer. Very frustrating. I now just want my money back but you don't get your money back if nobody replies to your messages!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice app. But I'm 12 and not willing to pay for all the good options. If you would consider the age groups that use this app and add more nice feature for free users that would be nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I immediately uninstalled the second I saw the paywall. Why on earth would I pay (any amount) for something I can do for free by myself? NOPE Edit: Response to Dev comment: NO. NO THANK YOU."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I want to use this app and i dont have money to pay pls help me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled the subscription and they are still trying to charge my card! Good thing I have them blocked from making charges!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I liked the app but it was a little too complex for me. There was just so much going on I guess but it is a good app if you want to stay on track with your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful. Tried the trial. Gave up and cancelled. They took the money anyway and won't refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not practical and Very expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've grown so much using this tool to help with my ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hard to cancel...thought I had cancelled on the app but then it has you go the the website to cancel and doesn't give you the website name, feels scammy. They are supposed to be Fabulous but just want your money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"the screen alarm is so intrusive. They also lost my account which I payed for, basically losing my annual membership. I emailed them about it and they gave a generic "" delete the app and restart"" solution. I highly don't recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to help make small meaningful changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Super misleading intro. I thought I was signing up for a free 7 day trial the suddenly got charged $44 and over drafted. Guess who's not buying groceries tomorrow? Edit: all of this happened in one day. I thought I was being signed up for a free trial and 5min later I got an over draft notification. I didn't even get a chance to use the app. This has nothing to do with me forgetting to cancel a subscription. This has to do with the app being really miss leading."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"And nice concept and thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As always, discovering the app being pay-to-use after installing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful.. I love it‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still learning some things are confusing and not very transparent or easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had this app years ago when it first came out, it was great but life happened and I fell off of it. And now it's nothing like what it was. It takes up too much time with all these prompts, videos, ect. I miss the original and found the new version to be very distracting and takes away from actually setting habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I see some people saying that the app didn't make them change anything. Of course it didn't. It is just an app. And a great app btw. If you really want to achieve something it provides a great pacing and little by little strategy for improvement. Those who made it really took time and effort to inderstand the human mind. Great tool. (And just like any other tool - it won't do the work for you, but surely will help you do it yourself.)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is the worst up in existence, it legit billed me without any notifications and they don't even have a refund policy, absooscam, do not download"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a good concept, however after a few weeks of using it stops notifying you which I don't understand, I have to keep going on the app instead, it's the reminders that keep you motivated. I've paid for a year subscription. Update, it automatically takes a payment out yearly, I have not paid or wish to have for another year,they should contact you to let you know your yearly subscription is about to be automatically paid, I rarely used it all year and not planning on keeping."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the greatest routine planner I've ever tried"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Marvellous app. Helped me change my life. It is fun and looks beautiful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to get more out of your day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tell us that it's paid before making choose all the frigging options atleast"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Omg, stop sending me e-mails! I've deleted my account, ended my subscription, uninstalled the app and marked the e-mails as junk, still I'm receiving several daily!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"O aplicativo √© substancialmente mais interessante em ingl√™s, tem mais conte√∫do e os narradores soam menos mec√¢nicos.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I find this app useless for me. cancelation is impossible. all the different steps that makes it impossible to navigate. I should have read the reviews before signing up. it's frustrating that they rob me every year. I will try to contact my credit card company to get a refund and stop future payments. please make cancelation easy if you are truly legit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"All the reviews are paid, totally scam. It manipulate you into giving your data and important information to them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app will still charge your card even after you cancel the service and delete data. They will not provide you with any option to speak with customer service, instead Contact Us takes you to an online automated system where you can only pick from a list of issues that are too vague to narrow in on your problem. I canceled my service and then in October they began trying to charge my card again and every month after."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's too good but you should remeove the first intro triangle in which the fabulous soul enters. It represents illuminati and as a Muslim it's not suitable and appropriate for us. You must remove it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love the idea of the app. The sounds and animations are pleasant. There is just so little flexibility in what goals are set. Some things can be tweaked and worked around, but it is clumsy and difficult. It pushes goals I am not interested in and sends way too many push notifications. 5 for a single morning is ridiculous and makes me not want to open the app at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really effective app for developing good habits and improving mood. Wish the cost could be spread out monthly though, a lump sum of over ¬£30 could make it inaccessible to a lot of people."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good, I do wish the app would let me postpone certain challenges. It keeps asking me to exercise in the morning but I've just been diagnoses with arthritis in my pelvis and morning is a really challenging time for me to do this at moment. I'd love to postpone this goal and do something else for now until I've got this new diagnosis and meds more balanced"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a great app. Also, what I mostly like is that you can have a totally free account if you can't pay at all. Most ADHD applications would ask for a fee to start a basic account and I'd always have to cancel them 'cause I can't afford to pay a thing. This one lets you to have a basic account for free and that is why I've never used any ADHD management app, but this will be my first one. Thank you. Sincerely, Sam"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still learning the app. I wish it prompted the user a bit more through the day with voice alarms or something."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"One of the most annoying apps I have ever installed. It insists on utilizing annoying, over-powering graphics and audio EVERYWHERE. And, will force you to look at ads for their other products even though you have already paid for a subscription to Fabulous. This entire app is over wrought. They need to actually hire someone that cares about UX, and then study Google or Apple for clean design. What a shambles. I am happy to forfeit my subscription expense just to get away from this app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam. DO NOT subscribe. They will charge you for a premium subscription without your permission. No refunds."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've tried other habit trackers and none compare. Fabulous gives you motivation and daily quips that inspire you. It's not just a checklist. Its a guide. Beware- some cheesy graphics and noises but the content is worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I find it a bit creepy as the habits are set for you to decide what's good for you. The imagery and wording lead me to think this is somehow Scientology inspired."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraud application. Even after unsubscribed within stipulated time, still I was charged and money was deducted from my card. If the amount not refunded then it should be raised as fraud dispute."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have rarely hated an app right off the bat. Only after taking me through a questionnaire and before I even had a chance to use the app and see what it's like, I was prompted to subscribe. After x'ing out through several screens of subscription prompts, it finally started me on the process: asking me to commit to drinking more water. These people do not understand ADHD at all. Never mind that I don't have an issue with water consumption. UGH, hated it. Pretty graphics though."

Scammy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled during the free trial but they still charged me. Make sure you get a confirmation email and keep the email, they will not help you otherwise."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried again after supplier reply, but same. I dont trust it because MUST give card details for 1 week trial. - prev review - Very flashy presentation but have to start a trial subscription. Leads you through a ""journey"" - thats ok - but you have to follow its timetable so no idea it it is worthwhile or rubbish until you have paid a few weeks. Now i will have a load of work to find out how to cancel the subscription because uninstall doesnt. Cant adjust settings eg loud intro music on startup."

It helps you actually get excited about your goals and progress. Using the free version at the moment. Might just try the paid version and see"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription and after clicking the final cancel after trying to convince me to not quit, it charged me again. Total rip off. Who charges you when you cancel? Very unhappy. Feel scammed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my trial subscription on 7th of Dec well before the cut-off date. However I was illegally charged $30.99 on 17th of Dec for a full subscription & there is a secondary charge of $30.99 for 15th of Dec that's pending! This is disgusting and criminal. This app's audience has vulnerable people. I am on the disability pension & Christmas is in 1 wk! I am now BROKE due to these illegal charges & can't afford food! My bank just blocked Fabulous to protect me in the future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is soo good.The best thing about fabulous is the morning and night message that they give.it gives you the energy to begin the day or wind it up beautifully.The way this app pamper you to develop new habits is amazing..

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammers! When I buy a year's subscription, the first thing I do is turn off automatic renewal. How did the subscription end up not in the Play Store, but on the website? Why wasn't auto-renewal turned off? Why can't I cancel the payment request even now when I have no money on my card? The app itself is good, but all positive impressions are spoiled by the actions of scammers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really liking the app so far and decided to sign up for a year. Way too many features to describe here but if you are looking to make a meaningful change try, the free trial."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Sadly after downloading and paying a $5 free upfront before even seeing the app, I logged in only to find I didn't have premium anyway so can't do much on it and definitely haven't been impressed enough to spend ¬£16 a month. Great idea but too much hassle for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's neat. I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app with subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't matter if you cancel apparently, they'll still charge your card three weeks later and when you request a refund they tell you no and say you should have canceled??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app and got charged even after select the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Grateful to have it much improvement thank you üòÉ ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just love itü•∫"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disgusting they charge people ¬£35 for an app that is useless. Haven't used the apps for weeks and they still take money out of my account. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU CAN DO IT ON THE NHS FOR FREE!!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to love this app but I actually hate it. Zero flexibility in the goal setting. For example, the first goal is to drink a certain amount of water in a week. I don't have an issue with drinking enough water, I drink plenty. But there's no way to get by the first goal. You can't set your own goals it's super frustrating cannot possibly recommend. I've tried this app twice & I I'm never able to bypass the first goal even though I don't need that one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The way this app is set up is more thoughtful and effective than most other habit/life coaching apps I've seen. I like it so far."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Give reasonable suggestions to achieve goals and fulfill our dreams"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't add much works in to do list. Asks for premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app , I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app if you'd like to get premium 7 days free subscription. It is 40% free too so you can also use it like that. Has meditation, excercise, little habit reminders and self care and music etc. A LOT. No ads just wish there was more free options"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the colors, the instruction and it is very helpful:) this is exactly what i am looking for:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its helping me develop better habits that will stay with me in the future"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"For some time the app launched 1 Day Premium in exchange of ads. That feature enabled users to test premium features before making the buying decision. But that feature is now missing. Please consider reenabling it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"it's good but I don't get Premium app and that's tough I can't but more than two habits!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app. If thinking at your bad habbit or missing new good ones, is a good way to start with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app freezes when I try to go to Circles"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the short coaching lessons. They take me out of my head and help me put things into perspective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I really can't stand when apps make you jump through hoops and 6ou think You're about to finally be able to use the app-- but nope they have you put in your email then put up a pay wall. So not only did I not get to enjoy the app--i have to pay to use but even worse now they have my email and I'll probably get unwanted emails for life now... Great üòÉ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app wasn't for me, so I uninstalled it after a couple months. I thought I had also cancelled my subscription, but apparently I missed one of the many ""yes, I'm sure, cancel this"" steps. 9 months later, I was charged for a renewal, I requested a refund, but it was refused after many attempts at getting to real human support. Avoid this app and this company. EDIT: I see they replied, saying that I could get a refund with the right contact info. This is a lie. I wish I could reply to clarify."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed to the free 7 day trial, it gave me a choice to donate what I could so I paid 10, and then was charge $14 for 2 weeks? Well I clicked the back button and lost that page, it was on an ad on FB. So I open the app and no info or anything was saved, so I was charged $14 and I dont even have an account? Only option is to pay again to continue which I don't want to do. Please help???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice for self development, can be a benchmark to be better you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app as it's helping me achieve the goals or reason why I downloaded in the first place, but the payment pop up is my issue, it's not easy to issue payment in my country and I am trying to look at other ways to do so but it keeps popping up in every single challenge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is inexpensive and the program follows a sound method for building a better life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just downloaded it and opened it Such a cute app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is almost best ü•∞ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app. They guide you step by step to building healthy habits and they have journeys for a wide variety of goals that basically walk you through creating the habits in the beginning that will help you reach your goals, you just have to keep up the habits to reach your goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'd love to use the app but it won't take my card information. I've tried both of my cards and neither are working. I have money in both accounts and I used them both earlier today so I'm assuming it's something wrong with the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app for Habit building. The content and elaboration are thoughtful and powerful enough to evote positive energy and motivation to focus on worthy things in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app as like its name.great way to build a routine and consistent with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Edit: I am adjusting my review from 4 starts to 2 because I discovered through an ad that I was missing the journal on the App. I have sent in 2 tickets, talked through several emails, done everything under the sun they have requested to try to get it back and it has all failed. I requested a partial refund for my unused time on the App because I can't use a major piece of it and have gotten radio silence ever since. I am deleting the app and canceling my renewal atleast."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still getting use to following a schedule, but I like how the app works. It's not overbearing like some I've tried. It's worth a try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It has good animation but it is not free.. If it was more and more people would have been attracted üòäüòäüòìüòì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Literally life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Non-premium members cannot achieve their process which is really bad because if something happens with your phone, you loose all your achievement. Should definetly be changed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unbelievably difficult to use, extremely cluttered. I'm sure this is a great app but I can't do anything with the constant interruptions, stupid animations and extremely extremely poor usability"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's really helping me so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite app, but now a subscription is required."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I cant do much without subscription i think"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was going to have a look at my subscription plan. That's how I found out managing my subscription could not be done in the app! I had to go on an investigative journey to manage my subscription. When I finally got there, I decided to just cancel it as we all know they have made it stupendously hard to cancel on purpose. The app might be fine but I don't trust them with my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very useful üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Long may it be free and great üî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app, I've had premium for over a year. Has helped me become aware of where my habits need help. **I'D LOVE A DARK THEME** especially since I have trouble sleeping, and like to use this at night to update my habits. The *bright* white is jarring and harsh and keeps me from wanting to use the app before bed for Nightly Coaching and winding down"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm changing my review from 5 to 1 star. Please mark what is for premium users, then I can decide do I want the premium. This also applies to the ADHD app. It's wasting your users time to give something as an option, I start it, it goes bit and THEN says it's for premium only These time is very valuable to people, if you waste their time, they're not going to like it. So it's a tip to keep your users. I'm stopping using it, I'll check in a few weeks if that's changed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating and easy to use and follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I genuinely think this app was created for the betterment of others. The features are truly growth intentional for us and love that the management are able to accommodate when your in financial stress. Grateful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Playing into lgbt and all the personal questions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm stuck and frustrated. I signed up for the seven day trial and cannot find a way to cancel. The auto-suggestions don't adequately handle this. Any help will be appreciated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app to start for self caring ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using Fabulous for 7 months. I started because I was struggling with motivation for gig work after surgery, and hoped for motivation. I got it, but it was not what I expected. That's not a complaint! I was frustrated at first because I already drank water, already had a morning routine. But looking back, all those small steps, repeated regularly, over time... Have led me to motivation for gig work, and getting unstuck to the point I feel good and am starting a new job. It's great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it is helping me to catch up with myself and have time to do everything in a better way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very annoying start. I couldn't get to the planner for like 10 minutes. Uninstalling now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. It doesn't feel as clinical as a regular to-do list. I would've preferred it if the Circle communities were more active."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is not a single feature as free trial i.e. without adding credit card, when you start app for first time it asks many questions, only after that it mentions that 7 day is free(which is fine) but you still have to provide card details and depending on user base of this app many will end up forgetting and paying atkeasta month even without as that will be auto cut Shameless money heist using auto subscription models Shame on Google Play Store to recommend such apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waaaaaay too complicated to setup and get going. A zillion screens with confusing animations and blaring color schemes. By the time I felt like I could play with it I felt angry. Maybe I'm not the demographic for this app anyway, but hey, YouTube slammed the ad in my face and I was curious, not curious enough to be patient with the onload though. Dec 23 Update: FB ad showed cool morning routine feature. Still bad onboarding. Feature was locked! Forced a sub sign up to even get there. Fail."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged immediately after starting the 7 day Trial Period! In-app automated help has been useless. This app is doing nothing for me but I'm still within the 7 day period. Please refund! UPDATE: You charged for me for the trial period. There is no link for that in your FAQ. You're also trying to direct me to the Play Store for your error in charging me for the trial. This is really shady behaviour for an app that's apparently trying to help people.UPDATE: I keep e-mailing and there is no response"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this appüò´ü§çü§çit's very useful and has a lot of benefits and improves your lifeü©∑ü©∑ I really recommend it so badü§çü§çü´∂"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally Recommended !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"26Oct2022: I have restarted my journey. I realized how helpful the app is in keeping me on track if I remind myself to complete the habits. 20Sep20: I fell off the wagon and rolled down the hillüò®üò®üòÖ. Not to worry I am back on boardüòÉüòÉ. Love the training on this app. Enjoying the reminders, however two of the tasks won't leave my home screen. I don't want to add friend's but it's still there. I've added my friends when I was on an older version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how my mind set is changing! I noticed I needed a change and this app has provided the change that I so needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was offered a free 30 day trial but I decided not to use the app and did not subscribe to premium?? Yet they still took ¬£34 out of my bank. account when I was not interested in the app??? How do i cancel?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app, so cute and organized,, no ads if u get premium ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is really fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After a long annoying inaccurate questionnaire you discover you have to pay for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had unsubscribed premium before my 7 day free trial ended. But, still they deducted payment from the source. This is a huge bug and I want my money back!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"used in the past and always come back when i fall out of the good habits the app helped me establish"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just started using a few days ago. I enjoy the structure and easy to use app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps when I have intense brain fog or experience my severe ADHD + depression waves (both diagnosed). It helps me get up and do what I need to while also getting rewarded. I've used this app for years but recently came back and I forgot how much it changed my life. The premium is so worth it too, I'm not even joking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand and use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription 2 years ago, and somehow, this app managed to charge me this month! I am disabled and in between jobs. These people literally took my bill money from me. I had to report them to my bank for fraud. I haven't been able to afford extra luxuries for a while because I am STILL in debt from when the pandemic hit. I found it incredibly crooked and cruel that they would charge someone who is struggling. Yes, I had properly canceled my subscription thru google play!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small steps, taken regularly, to achieve lasting change. For years I've tried to find ways that work for me to be healthier & happier. I've finally found it. I started a few months ago with that first small action, the water bottle next to my bed. The next day: a 5 min walk every morning. I'm to the point that I don't feel right without my morning 45-60 minute walk. I stopped craving soda and sugary foods weeks ago. I have lasting change. More importantly, I have hope. I KNOW I can do it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. Finished the first section, now onto next mountain. And yes, this is coaching and reminders. You still have to do the work! But I've come to look forward to it. If something feels like a chore, back off and make your tasks smaller. And then build up. Great app. I'm currently living alone in a new town and it's like a companion. Edit: it's been 3 months now and still love it. Going through different journeys. It's helped me be more mindful, more in touch with myself ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice looking application. But that's all. (btw, i don't remember seeing daek mode in there) Otherwise the app feels like a scam. App doesn't offer anything for free. ""Free trial"" is free only if you pay annual subscription. If app creators believed in their product, they would have given us option to opt out front subscription every month. .... If you need mental help, first step is to read other reviews and think twice before you click ""subscribe""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most amazing app , so recommended ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π , it helps me relax and start a new life journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I need help canceling my membership. I don't have the F. App anymore and have not used it in months. Do I make a phone call? Also I would like to get my money back. I recently got charged $39.99"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi Even after I cancelled subscription you are trying to deduct money. Pls do not cheat like this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Works great as a routine planner, habit building tool etc. Storyline is great as well. Probably could be a little cheaper for the paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I loved it at first when you got part of a story each day to keep you motivated to use the app, I paid for membership and shortly after the story stopped, I was barely into my ""journey"" my interest from this point on fizzled out so it became a waste of money. What happened to the stories?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Transformative. Small steps encourage you to reach goals. You are motivated and inspired along the way. I would DEFINITELY sign up for Premium membership if my budget allowed but am VERY grateful for the large amount of resources and support given even on the free version. Best app for motivation and self- empowerment. Sign up to begin 2024 on a positive note!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it helped me so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like this app so far! Would love to buy the app if the below applied! Have a monthly pay option instead of a 1 year lump cost. More icons to select with new routines tasks that aren't in the system. Audio words for new routine tasks that reads the task you typed in when doing the routine. Add steps to what a task is (example: Face Routine - a. Cleanser, b. Toner, c. Serum, etc). Have cross play with other apps you promote or partner with will show tasks or progress on the main app - Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AMAZING!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am just getting started, but this looks like it will be helpful and fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So many in ap purchase requests that there should be a price for closing the windows. I am permanently deleting this lame af ap. Finch is the best one by FAR."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually Worth The Investment. While using the app, I never realized that my biggest failure comes from trying to change too much at once, out of shame or guilt. The app is slow, but also consistent. It explains each step you take, and why it's important. It is very encouraging, no shame, and even helps you wind down at night. You deserve REST. Its has inspired me to eat healthier, and do it without shame. I actually feel very confident I will reach my goals of being a happier, healthier person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app, love the structure. Finding it hard myself to stick to it. But it keeps bringing me back. Going to get there. - Update, recommitted to meeting goals and smashing it. Just kept trying and starting over and it started to click. The app made a huge difference in keeping me motivated and in check, so I didn't bite off more than I could chew."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Alarm should work like phone alarm, it need to ring harder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been a great help for me to build healthy habits. Absolutely recommended for anyone who are trying to build their habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really works. Helps me understand my value and uses motivational quotes in a fitting context."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's paid version free only for a week after setting up it will be 135"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too complicated and slow. Stop forcing people to purchase. Instead focus on making this app worthwhile; money will follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had opted for 1 week free trial, cancelled subscription before end date , still payment has been deducted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best productivity app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Way too cluttered before it lets you do what it is supposed to let you do. Unnecessary pop-ups, clicks and the process to add a task to your plan is not at all a user friendly experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for 1 week now and I get so motivated by having these mini routines and mini goals that propel me to my bigger goals. I love the platform and coaching sessions. They don't just help you with your routines, they give examples and ideas to get you started. I feel like I'm not doing this on my own. It's been so great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app to help me stay disciplined. Pity I cannot afford the premium currently but as soon as I can, for sure. I am thoroughly enjoying the trial. I feel accountable for my personal growth without any guilt or shame should I break a streak. What a lovely app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app really starting to change me for the better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fascinating.I really started to build good lifestyle üíúü¶ã"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic monetization of your fear and insecurities. You want to improve and they want to exploit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had to edit my review after reading the others because I feel a point must be made. This is a brilliant life coaching app it's the best I have tried it's only $4 a month! How much do you all spend on your other subscriptions to sit around and watch tv not making any change in your life. This app is very dynamic well worth the money it's extremely helpful for me and I know it will change others lives too im shocked people think it should be free, you pay to drive on the roads nothing is free!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam. I cancelled everywhere it was possible to cancel and now they charged me DESPITE me cancelling and when I email them they deny the email addresses I give them are registered. Currently on the phone with my bank to dispute the charge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome experience and I am glad coz it's definitely a good choice to install fabulous!ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for about a week now and am really enjoying it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Making daily lists and accountability coaching is good. But knowing I paid $40 to get other expensive paid products like live coaching and other apps shoved down my throat *every day* is doing more harm than good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great appü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the onboarding and consistent vibe of overall app, the experience is so smooth, your teams knows what you are doing, love the way your app is designed and developed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a paid app ..even if I want to try it for a week I'll have to add payment method and it will deduct money without even informing us"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very impressed. Interesting and easy to use. Because of the price, i think many people use it lots to start with, then stop completely. Habit building is great. Focus areas are great. Favourite part is the readings. Cancelling subscription is more complicated than it should be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, just the right combination of goals, routines, insights and motivational bits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged randomly a year after using the app. I had deleted it long ago and forgotten about it. I'm completely sure i only used the fee version not premium and since it didn't work for me (even tough the graphics are beautiful and it looks really cool),I never planned to buy the premium. I would like to get a refund for that but the only client service is a bot. So probably could be a wonderful app for many but for me it's a bad experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚úåÔ∏è‚ú®~Glorious~‚ú®‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Starting is easy and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me so much. This is my second time using the full version. Once in 2020 and again now in 2023. It is worth it for me. Scheduling habits and the way the app rebuilds your life so you feel better is incredible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just feels like nagging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app so far! :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just What I Needed. I know not everyone is keen on this method of habit forming and goal setting but the techniques are great for me. The app is wonderful, the art stunnjng, and the lessons are well written. It is an expense, but my health and wellness are important to me so I find the value."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I don't pay for games or apps, let me tell you... this is the best app for what I was looking for. I have PTSD, suffer from depression, ADD, and others. This app is really beneficial and it's fun at the same time. I could see this app being helpful for everyone, not just people like me. Anyway, so I got the free trial and ended up buying it. I'd rate more stars if I could."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would like to have at least 3 at a time of the day without having the premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I bought the premium several months ago and I haven't been able to use it. Send emails to the support and they don't help at all. I asked the refund of my money and they haven't contacted me yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING!!!! RUN!! RUN!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!!!! Read and trust the ONE STAR REVIEWS. You will sign up for the 14 day trial and they will bill you $39.99 before the end of the trial. When you try to cancel they make it so hard to find out how you signed up...Play Store...email...website...and give you next to no help. By the time you jump through hoops to get find your account....BAM!! THEY TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks and find that my mood is better and I'm feeling more engaged as a result."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous's content is outstanding! Look forward to reading/listening to the coaching sessions. Advice is solid, support & encouragement towards goals is gentle, consistent & empathetic, & the narrators are a pleasure to listen to. I feel the app needs further development. I'd like the app to sync between devices. Moderators/coaches sometimes ask users to post a pic of their progress. Can't figure out how to do that on my Android phone. Can't edit comments. Phone version is Android 11."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Learning to cope with anxiety and stress.. It's so helpful I wouldn't of expected it tbh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started this Fabulous app a couple of weeks ago, and already it is really helping to change me into the person I want to be. It is kind of expensive when you add another app to it, but it's worth it if you are seriously ready for change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app, so far, has helped me implement change in a way I've never been able to solidly continue. I'm still early on in the process, but the changes it's helped me to experience already?....highly recommend for people who try and try again and never seem to quite ~make it~ where they wanna be. YOU can do this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app and I really love the coaching talks. It's been helping me feel more relaxed and I am working on being healthier thanks to this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hello. I love the attentive company, input and advice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the general idea. however, it's a little bulky to use. I downloaded the app because I have ADHD and need everything in one place. Also, the adds havcool pictures of self care checklists and other things. I have never seen that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a nice app but the fact that you have to pay and still have ads on the home page is really annoying... i just canceled before my trial ends, if you wanna advertise for your other paid apps, it is fine, but at least give us the possibility to hide it from the home page"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Almost impossible to cancel subscription. I didn't even finish making an account and they are charging me after a year of not even touching the app. Scam or not its garbage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"In terms of features, it's 5 star, I'm only removing 1 star because it isn't optimized for foldable phones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have the premium so don't deal with ads. It the second time I'm going through the process, I found it really good to form habits first time round, ans I'm using it again to get back into them follow some time being sick."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it! I'm planning on getting the premium member ship soon! It's so cute and fun! Very customizable and adaptive! üíïüíïüíï Edit: There is no free option anymore. That's lame. If your mission is to help, you should aim to help everyone, regardless of finances."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my depression in check and me on a routine even when my brain doesn't want too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive reinforcement of self care when life is challenging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the trial & cannot cancel, I get a bot that gives me an article & directs me to a google pay account which my phone cannot install. It said it was easy to cancel, & it's not, & I'm reasonably I.T. savvy. Tried it cautiously as I have a tight budget currently & it's not fabulous just now. Please contact me so this can be fixed, & I can edit review accordingly, as u cannot contact you any other way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful and relaxing it's helping me keep up with what I'm starting I just wish we could have the full app without having to buy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app as before ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅmy issue got resolved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They reduced money from my account and they are not answering their email"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ripoff - fraudulent. I took a paid trial but then they offered a highly discounted Premium subscription before I was done signing up. I took it as well. I find the app and the program juvenile and way too slow (stuck on a given habit for a number of days before you can get to another? no). After a few days I decided to cancel, and they're keeping my money! Robbery! 2-day trial for $69! This is for kids with more money than brains. Get Habit Tracker - you set your own habits and it's free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want Fabulous to control my life as it is one of the few good relationships in my life. It keeps me on track, motivated with it's coaching and my routine was unhampered since I started using this app. But! Apparently Fabulous wanted to play it tricky so it took away my access and stopped showing me ads. And now the relationship has turned as unhealthy as ever! I can't afford it and it doesn't want to help! So I am saying tata, bye bye and moving on from the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hey, I'm really enjoying this app. It's only been three days, but it gives me a sense of accomplishment in the morning because I set goals in the app. After completing them and clicking on the achieved goal mark, it feels incredible. It provides a real sense of achievement. I highly recommend trying out this app. I believe it will continue to be helpful in the future. I will definitely update my review after one week. Give it a shot, everyone!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have loved the fabulous app. It has made me want to become a better version of myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The coaching are very insightful. I love a lot of the quotes and stories.the meditations are really helpful and not too long. I love how it gives me reminders to journal. I already am a journaler but this app gives me more promps and ideas. I paid for the one year premium. I think its worth it and then some. I strongly recommend this app if you're looking to increase productivity or change habits or increase discipline. Best app I've found so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a nice app and easy to navigate. Will update when I have used it longer than 3 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I remember downloading this around 2015 and it was free and amazing. Obviously it's much different now, and I haven't used it in years"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used this app in the past to help with routines. Now it's impossible to do anything without a paid membership. Also takes forever to get through the sign up. Don't waste your time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Confusing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I wasn't aware I would be charged for the app (I guess I should have known better), but even after I cancelled my subscription, and got an email FROM Fabulous ""your subscription has been now fully terminated with immediate effect and you shouldn't have to worry about further payment attempts,"" they charged my card EVERY DAY for 20+ days, causing my credit card to be flagged and needing to be cancelled to stop the payment attempts. This app is NOT WORTH IT!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I developed good habbits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"what i enjoy the most is the stories after completing my daily task.I wait to listen next part and for that i have to complete my next goal.This technique make completing your daily goals fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After experiencing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its but a game changing to adhd users üòì‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's been only less than week i'm using this app but i'm already seeing results and there's nothing i don't enjoy about this app! really love the user interface and user experience but on top of that, the content, coaching, letters and everything it provides is really heartwarming and feels like a supportive friend. thank you fabulous team!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My review after a month. So far I'm loving the app. The graphics the content. Really a fabulous app I've come across to get myself organised and build routines and actually stick to them. I even took an yearly subscription. I say it's worth every penny. Just hope the devs will keep going with the new content cos I've seen reviews that state repeated content. Eitherway kudos for such a wonderdul app. UI and everything is so fluid. My question is how do I save progress if I'm switching devices"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me manage my OCD better and work on being positively productive with my time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wish it was free but absolutely amazing, genuinely worth the money!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful for obtaining good habits & routine üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First morning. Loving it"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Feels positive after it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how this is getting me started on a journey without drastic changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I never got past the initial questions. It wanted my data and to set me up for a super expensive yearly subscription before I even got to see what the app was about. It used manipulative tactics (a ""contract with self"" and a message from your ""future self"") all designed to con you into paying by making you think you yourself already thought it would be best to do so. Lol. Nah. Horrible first impression, looking at reviews here I'll never doubt my intuition again xD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for making routines And getting back life have some will power and tackle all the hurdles"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's no way to try it without paying, if I knew it was completely paid, I wouldn't have installed it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Dangerous app collecting fingerprint"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lot of unwanted things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helps people build routines and provides you with the necessary tools to be successful üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wait of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really used to like this app, but now I've paid for the full Premium subscription and rejoined, the home page and ALL other pages are just constantly filled with ads trying to get me to ""SHARE WITH FRIENDS"" or subscribe to more things. Even once I ""X"" them they're right back, next time I open the app. It's distracting, which is exactly what I'm struggling with and NOT what this is supposed to be. I can understand having these things on a free version but not once you pay for the premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"its wotk."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"An annual subscription was charge when I never signed for it, after the tryal it was supos3d to be the monthly one. Now I have this unexpected extra bill to pay. It's too expansive and there is NO REFUND policy. Honestly, the app isn't worth that amount of money they charge, I was willing to try it, but the surprise charge is so desonest I don't even feel like looking at it anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm new so that's why rating is so high. I see se bad reviews nit took a chance. Routine flow app doesn't work right. I wana Manifest a great app to help me better myself and my life and my kids life. But I just noticed that the pictures advertised are from their company apps that aren't even out yet. Also all these other company apps and their included in app purchases should be added to this main app subscription. YOUR REPLY IRRELEVANT!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's kind of tricky. App takes you thru then at the end, it surprises you by saying, 'try your free week', then $3.99 after that per month. I don't like this tricky trick because app does not mention it in the beginning after you had put all your personal information. I uninstalled the app at the end. Will add any emails coming from it in my junk."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"update 11/2023 I get out of habit using this app but keep coming back. I highly recommend it! Original in 2017: I've been using this app since right after launch. This app has changed significantly. I use the sphere subscription and it is absolutely amazing. I am now in the habit of drinking water when I get up and eating a healthy breakfast and exercise daily. I'm now working on the self control Journey. I love this app. If you make the dedication this app will change your life for the better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAMMED. My friend sent me a link to try premium free for 30 days and the IMMEDIATELY charged me for $67. I didn't realize until days later so they refuse to refund my money! It was actually a decent app until I realized what they were doing. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE OR JUST USE THE FREE VERSION. NEVER GIVE THEM YOUR PAYMENT INFO THEY WILL ABUSE YOU."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps you feel satisfied and it is a dopamine rush to help your brain feel the reward signals as an extra motivator to make practical and positive changes you may be having a hard time remembering. Love it!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its doing wonders.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really makes you more determined to change.... You have to pay money for extra good stuff on there but I guess it's fair enough. But the app without paying the money is also really good and it deserves a 5 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Personally, I love this app and everything about it. As with everything, it is not for everyone. Not all users will be pleased. But for me and the path that I'm on, this app balances well into my daily and nightly life. It teaches me just how BIG the small and consistent changes made daily can be in my life üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the free subscription before it ended as the app wasn't for me and was still charged"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Changed the rating from 5 to 1 star. I used to gravitate towards this app a lot but it's sooo frustrating to see how restricted it has become. Just absolutely disappointed to see no means of increasing accessibility. I've kept a bit of my previous review below. But the excitement for the app is just gone now. ""NOW, it feels like the Fabulous I'm familiar with. Yes it still has locked areas and what not, but their vision that felt like it was lost is BACK!! Congratulations to the team!!!!<3"""

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very new user but I'm impressed. It's so easy to bail when you get busy, which is all the time, even if you want something different and better in your life. Breaking it down into little steps AND making you feel good about those little achievements while consistently moving ahead... brilliant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App occasionally has random glitches, but the content is excellent üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"overall the app is doing fine. its a good app for setting up you routines. but i have one concern. it would be great if i have an alarm option just in front of goal that i should complete in a particular time rather than a single alrm for a while routine there is option that we can add multiple alarm but that not what i really like."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is great for organizing and improving your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app! Loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. I tried it months ago to see if it would help with ADHD. I unsubscribed at the time, but was still charged an ANNUAL subscription fee a few weeks ago. What a rort. I wish I had read the comments and not handed over my credit card details for a 7 day trial. I've uninstalled the app but suspect they will try again. Recommend blocking through bank."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many bugs in the app. I bought the subscription but that didn't get synced with google play. Then the app got stuck at level 2 because the second goal would open blank and without reading the letter it won't progress further"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded to try free for 7 days and was immediately charged almost $40 and have not heard back from their team about a refund. Buyer beware Updated to say that I already emailed and haven't heard back and your bot is not helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice tool to build habits in very small chunks. But, there's a lot to figure out, so it's easy to miss things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No nice"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the experience creating a new life and setting realistic goals that are achievable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"- Nicely presented onboarding screens - Made me feel like I was starting something new and positive - Before I could do anything else I was presented with premium subscription offer for ¬£30/year - Choose the one week free trial - Immediately offered premium for ¬£16/year - Told the ¬£16/year offer won't be there after the free trial, it's now or never These sorts of time-based pressure selling tactics are completely contradictory to the ""self love and improvement"" vibe you're trying offer"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Problem with app is that I cannot even see the app, how it works, what I can do with it without leaving my credit card info. There has to be a free tour around the app so people could see whats it about."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Watch ad popups appear every 2 minutes, completely unusable. Very marketing focused but shallow in terms of value"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me make great new habits!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far nice and engaging. Somewhat linear at the beginning but I understand that they want to give you some easy wins. The price seems a little steep though. Let's see if I continue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Just to expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will charge you without mercy in one year and customer service will tell you it's in the terms and conditions. Even if you cancel on the renewal date. Buyer beware!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Reading some other reviews... People really don't understand how to use this app. It's not a quick fix or journal app. It's made by professionals who guide you. You're asked to do the same thing for 3 days in a row because that's part of healthy habit building. Just pay attention & they tell you that... For me, life-changing. I've subscribed for 3 years now. You get out of it what you put in to it. Using Fabulous in conjunction with the sister app, Clarify (for ADHD), has been great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this is great app now espasily for students i liked it alote and the most liked feature is waching one ad daily to unlock premium for the whole day its relly good thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perffffffffffect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: I have already visited the help center and done the needful and there is no response yet. Other apps have better service for the price! I was supposed to be charged $2 for a trial but instead they charged me a full $55 without explanation. Had I known, I would have cancelled in time and removed my card details. Now no response from the team despite multiple follow-ups! This is wrong, unjust and misleading! That too for an app that's supposed to HELP with mental health."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"change people life is significant, with Fabulous all things works for good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for everything and anything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"pretty and genuinely helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So I didn't know what to expect from this app but after actually using the app it has slowly helped me build a certain mindset that I was needing a little help with. A really great app and would suggest it to others to get."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Drink water. You lose 2lbs in water during the night through breathing and sweat, that's why you're lightest in the morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to cancel my subscription and I can't. Very very frustrating. One page leads me to another. I still have not resolved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like how it guides you through your routines step by step. I do wish there was more flexibility though. The app itself feels very rigid when in use. Also I don't appreciate still getting ads for your other apps when I'm paying for the service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've really enjoyed the motivation ticking something off each day hives me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Omg I just love it....it's not like any other app I have nothing to lie I just love this app from my heart"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using Premium for a long time, which changed my life. I'm exercising, I'm drinking more water, I am studying, and I have time for myself every day! Little by little, I've built a routine tailored to me and my busy days. I am a student, so the student discount was great as well. I recommend this app to my friends and family, and everyone. It's just so great! My only recommendation is to record again some of the guides since the mic quality isn't the best, and I need dark mode!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I see a lot of people are having issues with this app, but personally, I had none. It works perfectly fine, and it's really helping me solve many issues about myself, my habits, and overhaul negative thinking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I simply hate it when an app takes you through 20 questions and at the end told you to pay to continue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I just installed and set up the app. It keeps crashing after prompting me to hit the wake-up routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not optimized for galaxy fold 4, can't get past forced water drinking tutorial, uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yet don't know how will it work out, but as they say if you pay for something usually you value it more. I am positive about this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Misleading trap! Good theory & concept. Hard to navigate or just set up and come back to. The worst part is trying to get any real billing support, even in chat. It wasn't clear when I hit more info they billed me $16 instantly! Trying & cancel & I can't, it's just never ending referrals to articles, how tos but no clear link to cancel, nor do they make it an easy process to just end a trial. I wouldn't mind if they were actually helpful, this feels like a scam disguised as mental health help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is gr√®at! My only gripe is that you cannot view your progress for more than 3 months. This is where other apps beat Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm really enjoying this app to help with my mental health and daily habits. I struggle with several different key aspects in my life and this pp helps keep me focused on what's important and I also get to learn different things along the way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love the app but had premium issues at first. The email I signed up with was different than the email I paid with. I couldn't get any responses from support to change my email or get a refund. I Uninstalled and reinstalled using my other email and premium worked great! Until I missed a couple days. Now it prompts me to upgrade and says no subscriptions found. Back to bots for support. I'd really love a refund - my upgrade clearly doesn't want to work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very inspiring!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes more time to manage than it's worth, plus the shady billing system. I canceled ages ago and am still being billed. Don't do it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app. It's really helping me work out stress related issues with ease."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fabulous. Relaxing, calming voice, beautiful stories, beautiful colors and images. I really like it. Thank you for such a wonderful app üíï‚≠ê‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful a bit expensive but defy recommend has helped me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waste of time and money. They do their best to give you a free trial in their website and fooling you that you can easily unsubscribe but then trap you in a 1 year subscription because they do not provide you with information how to unsubscribe! Response to F. team: I have contacted to your ""Care team"" but they did not care and refused to refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app isn't working at all. Very bad experience after subscribing and not having any options to unsubscribe from the app. Not production ready!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app stops working after the first routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am only 3 days in, but I am enjoying it so far. It is empowering me to set routines for myself, and although it is simple stuff, I feel more accountable. I love the information and the graphics."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The user interface and overall user experience kind of really sucks. It's bloated and unclear. Also I don't like how it puts alarms on all the time, and is pushy about turning alarms on when I don't want to. Great concept, bad execution."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Payment mode"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: Don't get this app. It's a scam! The response they're given is written by a bot since I've sent 4 emails to them and their only suggestion is to send a 5th email. It's been more than 48 hours since I was charged and I'm not eligible for a refund anymore even though I emailed them and their help bot the moment I was. They stole $40 from me. I requested a refund from the official website since I forgot to unsubscribe and they have not sent a single email to me from their support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love most things about this app. It has really helped me focus on me and taking time for myself. The one thing I have issues with is the ""days in a row."" I'm a completest, and when a journey asks me to do a task three times in a week, if I don't do it each day, it restarts my days in a row completed. The result for me is pressure to do this every day and feeling bad about it if i don't. And frankly, there are days I just can't do everything on my lists. I wish this part could be turned off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a free trial and can't get past waking up and drinking water. I'd like to cancel before the 14 days is up but am not seeing any option to do so. Please help! This app is bunk! Don't fall for it. I tried to ""purchase"" a month for $2 and STILL couldn't get past waking up and drinking water! I ended up wasting my time and money trying to get this stupid app to work and it just doesn't progress past that point. I ended up uninstalling and disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pixel 7 pro app not working. Getting stuck at starting page itself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps you stay on track of your goals without needing much thought. It is a great way to stay motivated for your goals and keep them small and achievable. It has daily coaching and routines to insure you're in the right mindset everyday and all around implements a great and positive view on improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for free trial even after canxelling payment got deducted already raised refund issue still no answer. App is stuck on main screen after try more than 100 times it keeps on stuck on 1 page. When I will be able to get refund ? And how can you charge after cancellation of subscription that is beyond my understanding"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been a great experience The progress is slow but it's about developing habits you never had and I can see the changes in my daily routine what once used to be random and unhealthy has become ordered and I feel strengthed every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory billing practices - watch out! They will charge you $40 after sending you emails saying that your premium subscription isn't activated! Literally lying to you about whether they will charge you or not... When you reach out to them, they direct you to a bot that says ""no refunds allowed"". Crazy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect for setting Goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the idea of this app and was excited to try it but like a couple others on here it takes me to a page after signing up for the free trial where it talks about drinking water and then basically freezes. Close and open the app and it just does the same thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It sadly does not work at all for me. I try to do the first step (drink water waking up) and it counts me down from three and it's permanently stuck on that screen with ""get ready"" and I can't navigate off that screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Love this app. It's all step by step and keeps us consistent!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Overall, it is a decent app for creating routines. What I can not stand is that you pay for this and essentially get ads on the apps home screen to try other (pay) apps of theirs. There is no way to dismiss these. This points to the larger issue with this app; lack of flexibility. If I can create data, then I should be able to edit and delete said data. If I missed logging routine at night, I should be able to go back and edit retroactively."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Um bom app que ajuda na adapta√ß√£o a bons h√°bitos."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Paid membership, not free. Uninstalled for rival app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me a lot in becoming a better me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app and has a lot of potential. I am missing one thing, that you can't edit your routines. For example in the morning routine they tell you to have breakfast, but I am fasting in the morning so I have to skip it every time. That way I don't get 100% on my routines. After a while I just start losing the interest and motivation to do the routines at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting. I have an idea : weekends are different days in countries it would be better if we could change & set weekends"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Really awesome app but the subscription charges are little high and there is no option for monthly payment, it is only yearly. Also it will be really great if one or two months free trial is given, so people can try out the app and decide if the subscription is worthwhile."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I will give it three. Primarily for personal reasons. I've been trying to change my email address (on a premium membership) for days. There is no way to do this. I follow directions listed in images, videos, articles, and nothing. Can't get intouch with anyone. Can't submit a ticket. I'm at a loss."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is fantastic app for who want their life routine in a balanced and organized way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It takes years to start the app, and properly use it. It's terrible experience, without even seeing how it works, they immediately ask for premium. And after each action they keep asking for money. Free version doesn't allow you to add more than 2 actions or anything. Just deleted the app after 10 minutes of frustration..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely.enjoy this app a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app repeatedly freezes when I accept the first goal to drink water and I can't navigate off that page. I've attempted to reach out several times regarding this issue but have received no response. The app should be fixed or I deserve a refund for my subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Denfinetly not worth the money. Goals are not clear. A lot of useless text and too many reminders. Not good experience for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent tool to use and easy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never leaves the screen about drinking water, what a terrible experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stuck at the first step saying drink water. One of the poorest designs ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not goood"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far, helping with motivation, which had motivated itself to disappear!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2 days and i love it. Question? Theres a coaching part and a didn't make a screenshot of the story. Its a coaching part. Is there's a way can I look for it by date?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was fully subscribed and updated my phone. Can't get past the drink water section with my new phone. The Fabulous tells me that it's a known bug and then leaves me hanging. Very unconvincing customer support.. Additionally!!!! to ""developer"" .... Sorry, no, I've tried 100 different things to get the app to work but no success. It's broken and a robot response like yours isn't helping."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Something is wrong with the app. Trying to get started and can't get past adding the water goal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I gave this a 5 star rating based on how they represented themselves, I deleted the app out of fear of joining the free trial and then not being able to opt out.As well, I don't see how 7 days of trial can change my life... Then there's an issue of affordability of it premiums. I was excited though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Unusable on my Pixel 8 pro"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is so nice Fabulous is a great app for moring and night routines I have all the application the fablous Back to this app My day used to be messed up and running slow but this app changed it completely download it now üòÄüòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app ever I changed so muchhh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It reduces the decision making fatigue with the checklist. And trust me it's not basic checklist, it has been gamified a little. It has some predefined tasks and custom tasks can be added. The whole UI and illustrations are so soothing. This whole one task after another will keep you hooked. Some self control is necessary though. Plan and add your habits in the checklist, night before and experience a smooth next day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hats off to Duke University and the makers of the fabulous app. I love the daily coaching. It really instills the concept of starting small and growing your habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Should have read more reviews before tried it. It had a great series of questions when opened it & pretty graphics, was very excited. But it then forces me to the same 'drink water for 3 days' screen no matter what. Can't get out of it besides closing the app. Their help hasn't replied, just hope my cancellation actually works before they take money, since other mention that being a problem. Seemed like had great potential, but nothing followed up on that. Waste of my time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pretty great. I am a master procrastinator, so any helpful push in the right direction is a big plus. I feel this app is giving me that little extra push ü´∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't download this app right now, it's buggy and you'll get stuck on the drink water screen. I cancelled my subscription right away, there is no customer service to help out, everything and all responses are completely automated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's actually helping me change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seeing high review score I subscribed. But the app is stuck on first task. I cant mark anything as complete. I would like to get ny refund immediately!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I tried this in 2015 but did not stick to it. The content and layout are much improved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this App. It is so nurturing and calming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Literally couldn't get past ""drink water"" step. It just froze. Pressed everything and nothing happened. It just says get ready and that's it. Oh well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This for different challenges and how it starts you off slow, not too fast!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it IMPOSSIBLE to cancel the membership!!! I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. The option to cancel my account was not found anywhere!! None of the options as provided in the directions on how to cancel before being charged were present."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app was so good I am enjoying it each and every day I am happy with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much it is different from other apps and has been helping me make baby steps to becoming a healthier individual mentally and physically.. it offers you every angle to conquer whatever you are mentally dealing with it it's a great app I really love it so far, I would love to get a subscription to it because I did the 7-Day trial in I was loving it but either premium or standard it has great things to offer! I'm hoping to see a change in my behaviors and toxic traits etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful app I've developed many habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been absolutely loving this app, even when I lose my streak i still keep going ( I recently lost my streak of 23ü•≤). But I wish they would make a Widget, think it would really help with remembering to my routines and really add to the experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"UPDATE: I've given 4star rating before since the apps is all great except there's no free membership. But today I found a bug. Any removal of habits for TODAY is also reflected for all the previous days. I shifted the exercise to be in the wakeup instead of work day routine, and due to that I lost all my exercises records WITH MY PRECIOUS NOTES for all days before today in the work day routine. That should not be happening. Ask user first whether the change is only for today or not :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a 7 day free trial, and now whenever I log into it, it brings me to a quest to drink water for the next 3 days. When I tap accept, it counts down, but then stays there. I entered a support request but their emailer never sent me a ticket number. I can't even find a way to cancel the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app help emotions off every second. Habit of routine. thats help to achice goals in entire life..üëç respect you fabulous üíõ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I do want to become a better me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i unisntalled app but still trying to charge me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't start the first goal which is preventing any progress in the app, and the mobile website is asking me to resubscribe, so I can't just use the web to bypass the first goal without paying twice. Based off other recent reviews this is a common issue, and I will update my review when this is corrected. I used fabulous before, and want to like the app, but cannot recommend it at this time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fab keeps stopping. Can't even set up my first habit. It's maddening. Phone restarted and updates checked and nada. I really want this to work for me. Please help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"overpriced"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"very good appüåπ but it send a lot of notifications üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't get on to the app it keeps shutting down"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous App to reset your life, break bad ones and get back to life and cultivate new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"LOVING this app so far....especially the timer for my morning & evening routines. It's helping me stay focused since I have mild ADD!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is truly a wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"last year I accidentally signed up for a coach and cancelled I thought I had also cancelled my membership but I was charged again this year so I gave the app another try. now they have more money and the app doesn't work. it can't download my data and it freezes when I try to start over. even when it worked it was incredibly feminine oriented and not a good match for my style and super confusing to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The motivational content is really helpful. I love the app and the filosophy, but it isn't perfect. I had many technical issue that I felt discourage. It lost count of my progress multiple time. After a week I still didn't manage to upload my progress on my new mobile despite paying for premium subscription. I hope the support will get back to me but they are slow to reply"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tr√®s bonne application pour prendre de bonnes habitudes ! De plus, l'interface est simple et √©l√©gante !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Paying for this app would be an investment in yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Rip off forgot to cancel subscription used it for like 10 mins in a while yr and the renewed it, called them 2 days after said no refund cuz I have the web version lol, talk about reasonable explanation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes me to the drinking water screen, I accept then nothing happens. I've reinstalled still doing the same. Will cancel service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's just annoying after awhile and doesn't actually help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am enjoying this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a free trial, which would charge me at the end of the trial unless I canceled it. The app then takes me to a screen about drinking water every day and hangs, never leaving that screen. I can no longer access the part of the app where I can cancel my trial. I completely uninstalled and reinstalled several times and always get stuck on the same screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I paid for a years subscription in 2022. After 3 short weeks Fabulous denied me access to my premium subscription. I messaged Fabulous about the problem with no response. I love the app but was disappointed that they took my payment then cut me off with no reason and no refund. Everytime I tried to access my premium subscription I was told that I had to pay again. I paid for the Premium subscription for a year but only got it for 3 weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for a beginner, starts nice and slow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this app,it motivates me to complete healthy habits and routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps you accountable while reinforcing positive habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is something wrong with the app which means I cannot get past accepting the first challenge to 'drink water' for 3 mornings. App locks up and you can't progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It won't finish setting up. It's trying to set up water goal and it freezes. Then I have to go back and redo the whole thing. Then it freezes again. So as far as I can get is half setting the thing up. And I already have an account. Why didn't it ask me that before this quiz so I can just jump back in?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app, and it's good for starting routines a small step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is made for children. Awful customer support too. I requested a refund, but never got a response. The only interfaces you have are the support email listed here (no response!) or a chat bot that doesn't go anywhere, just passes responsibility to the play store. Definitely don't recommend for adults or anyone who wants a product backed by humans that care about the integrity of their products."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't get past accepting the first goal. (Edit) I don't think you understand, when I say I can't get past the first goal I mean i click accept task and it just sits at that blue screen for hours. If I close out it has me accept it again. Does not allow me to go forward to start that I completed said task, does not let me go back. Just sits at the blue drink water screen. The app appears broken on Android."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a paid app. You have to tell us before we download it or put a price on it. It took me more than 10 minutes of questions and register my email and in the end I faced a paywall. I have to accept the subscription to have the 7 days trail. At least give us the trail then put the paywall or put a price tag from the beginning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! My only wish is to have the option of turning on or off a habit for a day. Like, if you do it every other day or plan out in the future which days you'll do a certain action. Like a week/month calendar. Honestly, I'm a procrastinator, so having an app like this to keep me in order is super helpful. And of course it has a lot more to habit building and I appreciate all the hard work put into it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app it's super inspirational, the little messages of support go a long way & the artistry is beautiful. I tried so many ways to stop procrastinating and to get my life back on track but this was the kickstart I needed! Greatest thing about it is it reminds you of healthy habits and provides valuable insight and perspective. Also, don't know how to reply but thank you greatly app developers, you are wonderful individuals üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am still using fabulous. And I just downloaded the new adhd app. I absolutely adore it üòç 10 /10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not a big fan of the coaching part, but the routine planner is cool. I wish there would be more free stuff though, and the fact that they throwing special deals at you and forcing you to pay for the app before you even tried it out feels annoying. At least let me see what the app has to offer first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work, save your time and money by using an alternative option. I pad for the membership and it won't load past step one. It funnels you through a tutorial style start up process in which you cannot bypass, and it glitches and will not advance past part one. I will be cancelling and exploring other apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even if I always supported the ""freesource"" and ""open source"" for most of the apps that I use, after using Fabulous for 5 months, I admit that it is worth the price. The app is well designed, simple, and, most of the time, intuitive. Every contet available in the app makes it worth it, and I really appreciate the possibility of the 60% discount for students. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to start having a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed this app and suddenly started getting notifications from the app in my Facebook notifications. I did not knowingly give it permission to access Facebook! Creepy and invasive! Immediately uninstalling!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app - it is starting to change the way that I think about problems and choices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I find this app very helpful and very easy to stick to. I'm enjoying using it and actually look forward to checking in to see what's next."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App freezes immediately and support is non existent. I was actually excited for this app before the experience too. Shame but I have no patience for an app that is bugged from the start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find it nice. Helpful, the rest of the work has to come from you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Looks awesome. Still learning. But loving it so far üòç üòå ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app seriously is a scam. You have to enter payment information in order to utilize the app and they tell you it's a free trial then a week later charge you $40 bucks for it because surprise surprise, people trying to find an app to help manage their time would have trouble remembering that they signed up for that to get charged if they didn't cancel in time. 39.99 auto charge what a joke."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. It keeps me on my toes to follow what I said I would do. It is no annoying with notifications like other apps. Just great balance to keep me committed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even after paying for the premium and downloading their two other apps I am STILL harrased on the home page of the app to give them a rating, share the app with others, look at their two other apps, pay further for individual coaching which I already looked at it and declined. The animations are nice but you have to be really motivated to navigate the app to get to any good content. There's also no way of saving/bookmarking the coaching that does interest you so have to scroll everything again!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"exceptional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I mean, it seems good but I'm kind of annoyed that I can send a 30 day pass to other people but I only have 7 days and then have to pay. Where's my 30 days?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving the app, but am finding it hard to follow along with some steps like the coaching. I listen to it but it comes up again as an undone task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"app is buggy, often gets stuck on un-dismissable modals/dialogs/screens that are part of a forced interactions, unusable by trapping the user on a dead end. Navigation buttons are ignored, clearing cache/storage nor reinstalling doesn't fix the issues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to improve your self-discipline."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would give 0 stars if I could. I somehow have the $52.99 charge on my CC but didn't authorize this to happen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't start. Stuck on page with Drink Water. Great ready and it repeats."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overwhelming. Also they don't send reminders about end of trial so if you don't open the app hopefully you remember or you're just out the money even if you catch it before it processes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so wonderful üíØ üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's Over Loaded with many things, They should keep a simple ,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a free trial, which would charge me at the end of the trial unless I canceled it. The app then takes me to a screen about drinking water every day and hangs, never leaving that screen. A week later they charged me $40 because I can no longer access the part of the app where I can cancel my trial. I completely uninstalled and reinstalled several times and always get stuck on the same screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Premium member. 1 star."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I rate it in 2020 but I rarely use it, I'm installing this again at Oct 2023 Will do better and focus on it~"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"To my surprise, I found this app rather relaxing. The slow addition of items into a morning, work, and night routine was great, and the ""coaching"" devotionals were really impactful. I also really enjoyed the illustrated story. It was beautiful, calming, and inspiring. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the user interface is not as intuitive as it looks. It might just be my device, but after a coaching session, I have to click back and then the checkmark to complete the item."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If your ready to transform from the inside out in small,realistic steps that help your soul to thrive....look no further! I love fabulous and it has made me feel fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't move past the first introduction it tells be it's embarking on drinking water freezes and I can't do anything else but that I can't even cancel my subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is stuck doing nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App does not work for me. I'm stuck at the 1st goal after countdown. Seems this is a problem that affects more than one person. :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Functionality bugs make me question of it was worth paying for but it's a good motivational app when the notifications actually pop up. Besides the bugs it is great to help build new healthier habits slowly and over time to incorporate them to your daily routine. I am enjoying it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful and calming. Goes at your pace"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"planing is a personal job so how better to let the user to choose its way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Loving the thought provoking prompts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"initial experience is great and I loved the Knicks and knacks of the signup!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I recently started using a fabulous daily routine app, and I must say it has truly transformed the way I manage my day. This app has quickly become an essential part of my life, and I'd like to share my thoughts on why I love it. First and foremost, the app's user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to set up and customize my daily routines. I can easily add tasks, set their priorities."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is the ultimate app to keep you in check and drive your life to a higher purpose!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Interface is so overwhelming, getting used to the app takes much more time than it should."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivational and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The format is beautiful, but I didn't get a chance to explore the app without, I'm not lying, 5 different times being asked if I want to upgrade. This is in 5 minutes. The cool features are under the upgraded version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Too much ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"No way not to accept a goal the app has decided for you - not all things work for all people, the developers clearly have a thing or 2 to learn about how 'healthy' is individual, and not something that is the same for all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its cool but...!!! Why i cant do some exercises??!! I dont want to join sphere or what name IT has!!! I want the old fabulous!!! With cool new exercises, yoga,meditate,...!!!Please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I give up. Freezes on the first screen and doesn't let me DO anything. In a way it's the perfect torture device for someone who NEEDS what this app is supposed to offer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive.Tried it for free for a few weeks, but then could see the long term benefits as it has also become an easy and inspirational habit. Great encouragement tool when I definitely needed it most. Today is 22.10.23, and I recognise the benefits that working with this support to create and maintain habits has given me. Not just a tool, but a gift."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AMAZING APP!! I REALLY ENJOY IT!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I get started using this app three days earlier and at the time I like it. In a future I'll give more information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is wonderful in every way. congratulations to the developers!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not comfortable usable without paid subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really good although i don't have enough money to buy subscription but it's features are still good for start.üòäüéâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"App is good but premium payment is really high..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It preys on people with ADHD. It's overwhelming and they make you have to dig to find instructions on how to cancel. No email is sent to notify you that your subscription is about to auto-renew and you cannot get your money back, once it does."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved how it motivates you by adding small goals and all also it's completely customizable which is really great I enjoy the app so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for shaping behaviour"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to improve"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't have words to say how i am happy because of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Malicious billing practices"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App breaks. Tells me to get ready to drink water... Then just hangs. Can't go back or anything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"STAY CLEAR of premium membership. I tried the FREE trial and looked into the cancel time and information. I cancelled the subscription as it informed me to and way in advance, decided the app definitely wasn't for me. However it just so happened to not inform me that I ALSO needed to cancel the subscription on their website and this is not possible to do in the app! I got charged the full annual and coaching amount, now fighting to get my refund from this scammer of an app. Fuming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"makes good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for the past two days and it has made a difference in my ability to focus, choose tasks wisely, and to complete tasks with minimal distractions. Over all I am enjoying this app and it's two corresponding apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App basically doesn't work now. Seems interesting and looks beautiful, but I'm stuck in the first journey - drink water. I press ""accept the goal"", count down happens and then nothing. And then there is no way out of the screen, even Back doesn't do anything. Killed the app multiple times, this bug is consistent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely trash it forces me to do things in its own way, bro let me decide my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is a massive scam!! Stay away! I downloaded it by curiosity then erased the app few days later as the content is interesting, they charged me ¬£30 a year later!! Ive never used that app! It was not on my Google play subscription so I couldn't even see it or cancel it that way, they stayed very quiet, no emails or anything but ¬£30 taken from my bank account a year later!! And when I contacted the customer service to explain the situation they sent me a very dismissive email! Theifs!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has made me look forward to small random events from drinking water, to writing myself a letter. I have not 1, but multiple things to look forward to throughout my day. Forever a fan. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spent $40. Followed the prompts to set it up. App wouldn't let me off the ""commit to drink water"" screen. Contacted support, and they said ""yeah we know, we have no ETA on when that will be fixed, thanks for the $40"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Some areas meet additional choices"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I forget alot but this app is helping me really start routines. It adds structure to my days which are usually chaotic."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I need more options for day start and end as a shift-worker. I wanted my day to cycle at 4am, not midnight or 2am. If someone works a 9-5, and their day ends at midnight, that's 7 hours, if my shift ends at midnight, I would like the end time to be at least 4 hours from my work day end, not 2! That being said, I like the progressive addition of new small habits, pretty and interactive ui, and the articles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app several years ago, and it was great. Resubscribed yesterday, and it's not working. It keeps getting stuck on one screen and will not move forward. I tried on my iPad, but it's saying my account is not premium when it is. Contacted help with no response. A wasted $39."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only used 1day and it added value to the way I tackle things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been an overall positive experience so far. I have noticed my level of stress has gone down since the app recommended journaling. I am trying to improve and hopefully this app will be a tool to help me do that. **Update: Deleted my progress so I could start from scratch, but now it won't move beyond accepting the first task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"To expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a revelation! It goes beyond typical planner apps, it's your guide to achieving goals, teaching patience and balance. I assure you, this app is more engaging and inspiring than therapy sessions! ""Daily Coachings"" are gems of wisdom, shaping your best self. An investment in the future, and it deserves every penny! It deserves even more, I appreciate that it's easily accessible! If you're motivated and want to do the best you can, Fabulous will be a fabulous companion! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT subscribe to this app, they double charged me, taking 4 payments instead of 2 and they design it to be impossible to unsubscribe and take your money that way...funny that a wellness product acts opposite to their brand. Their app is extremely buggy on the payment side. There is dark UX patterns in their UI. Its impossible to unsubscribe, this is a known issue as they say it in their FAQs and screws the user financially. Block them via PayPal because their customer service won't help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very slow. Cant see any functionality without subscring"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app. It is a so good productive app üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Designed to keep you on the app and is not helpful in any way. Super confusing to navigate through and have to spend tons of time on the app to even move forward. Incredibly difficult to cancel and ask for refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm Still figuring out if I really love it. I've only used it 6 days. Lots of free features and paid. I'm still in the free version. Seems easy to use so far."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app I wish you could have app for story books"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. Helps you build some simple habits that makes you the person you really want to be. If you desire change, use the fabulous app today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First this app collect your emotional information after collected they show up you a membership . If you have no munny you can't use this app .

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit - I am NOT getting responses to my help tickets I joined ""through google"" and when I made my payment for premium, it went through using a different email. Now it won't let me in. I've sent several tickets requesting a refund (so I could join again and upgrade with the proper email) OR if they would change my email associated with my fabulous account. I had loved the app so far, but seem to have hit a brick wall when it comes to support. I paid. Either help me get access or refund me please."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for be the best type of yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app has been the best life experience so far. With my many illnesses and disabled but still have my mind, for the most part, this app will give me even better ways to progress in life. July 2023. Now, October 2023. Just had the 3rd ""SUBSCRIPTION LOST"" I completed my consecutive 90 days just last weekend and for my birthday looks like I will be STARTING OVER COMPLETELY as it looks all was lost.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to help keep you focused on building routines into your life and making positive changes for yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I liked it but I don't like the format. I would rather see the calendar feature listing the routine one at by one instead of in a bundle. The one thing I don't like about the app that made me stop using it is all the extra features. I never use them and their just a distraction. I would rather have my routines, the time it takes to do it and that's it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really wonderful app. Pricy, but it's been worth it for me. Has helped get me sorted enormously :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wants too many personal details that are not relevant to the needs of the app. You don't need my age or my email but requires it to proceed with app. So, no thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't even go through my first challenge because the moment I accept it, the app becomes unresponsive and unusable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Does not work well on Google Pixel 7 devices"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Thank you it's just amazing to get into track your goals targets whatever you can say even tracking life..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have subscribed and paid. But the app doesn't work. It starts with giving me a ""drink water"" task. I accept it but nothing happens. Stucked at that page. That's so not cool. I want my money back or at least fix it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"my routine is best is app love it‚ù§Ô∏èüòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When looking up this as a day scheduler, this is the first thing to populate. It takes your fingerprint before asking for $40. It should be upfront from the beginning. Otherwise, this looks like a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I rarely rate apps. This one really is great. Been super helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great I just started and I love it .at first I thought that I can't make multiple habits and as soon as I asked for help I got it . Thank you to the person who responded right Away this is a great app and really thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app in Google Play Store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app.. Five stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app makes goals attainable faster."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I am back after two years and I am not sure if I am staying. I feel it did not improve much since I last used it so I will give it a try during the free trial and decide whether to stay or not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A really fabulous app which questions us to answer ourselves the things we are not clear about!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I recommend this app to everyone it's a life guidance..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Only been using it for a few days. But so far worth the money. Update: I still love this app! It's giving me motivation and focus. I feel like maybe I can really get a routine in my adhd life and become more mindful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so nice to have a coach and those daily reminders and words of wisdom throughout the day....it's nice to see small changes can turn into big habits ü©∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have had some problems with this app and stopped using it for awhile. I'm back and the problems have been corrected. I'm still struggling with the personal issues that caused me to download Fabulous in the first place, but the baby-steps approach, the encouragement, and the flexibility to create routines and schedules specific to my life are really helping me to improve."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't load my backup when I installed the app it always fails to load the backup. When I try to start the app without loading the backup the app stuck at accepting the water challenge. After accepting the challenge, the phone showed embarking in 3, 2, 1 and then nothing happened"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Taking it one day at a time feels wonderful üòå I can do this! And I deserve this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's beautiful to experience happiness and know that I am taking steps each day to making myself better and enjoyable. Thank You so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"No option to set different routines for different days (weekends for example)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think it is really a good app I feel depressed before downloading this app But now i feel so good and l removed my all depression Thank you for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Originally I gave 5 stars. However, recently I tried the 7 day free premium trial and was going to move forward with paying annually. I just canceled it before the cost would take effect due to numerous reviews of how the pricing was incorrect, trouble canceling it, or being charged after canceling. I would rather stick with the free version. Also, email reminder to keep or cancel said the yr is $19.99 ""plus any taxes"". What does that mean? Sounds like it will be more than expected."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far going good. Contents are very good and has high level of understanding. Picturisation of each topic and habbit with sound is very soothing. Just it takes time to understand how to use app fully. So far I am enjoying free premium membership and looking forward to buy. Just reviews of cancelling subscription anytime putting me in doubt but otherwise found perfect app for mental well-being atleast to start with. Hoping to continue this journey for longer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app for building habits with least resisitance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE! This company will scam you, do not give them your payment details! They have ambiguous T&C's and a target audience of people who may have difficulties with organisation and executive function or mental health issues, meaning it's easy for them to take excessive payments without getting caught as scammers. The app itself is fine if it suits you, but is all bots, not personally tailored and definitely not worth the money (they took hundreds of pounds beyond agreed amount in two months!)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It change my Behaviour a lot And it was my first time and u love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Continues to charge us for the really subscription even though we canceled our subscription a long time ago and it is not listed in our Google subscriptions so we have no way to stop the charges since we deleted our fabulous accounts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app in that it helps me track forward and allows me to grow and shrink these habits as my life cycle allows."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm on Day 5 of my free trial. I have used the app every day! That's an accomplishment for me. I usually get sidetracked. I will be subscribing once the trial is over. The user interface is simple and fun to look at. Starting with the small steps is definitely working for me. I usually try to do everything at once and then get so discouraged when I fail. Loving this app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Such a annoying app with its sound and introduction just let me see what is it first! Edit: what is hard that you need to spend time for start using the app. Inhad to spend ~10 mins of introductions texts readings things pop up around you have to click where they want... It is not user friendly at all, it didn't let me explore the app myself and i just uninstalled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent content!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really good and very positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are still charging me over a year later with no option to opt out."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Divine application, well done"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using fabulous for a month now and it's been great it's helping me reach my goals one step at a time and has lessen my anxiety by pointing out my positive characteristic and working on my self esteem. I have moved from being fearful to being brave and it only takes one habit at a time to change that's what I've learned from fabulous Great app thank you to the fabulous team apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelente"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My ""lifetime"" subscription expires this year and they want to charge $49.99 per year starting on the 19th... seriously screw these companies and their greed. Help people by squeezing every dollar you can out of your user base..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My previous experience was great! Back in 2016. I decided to check them out again and join about a week ago for the trial. My understanding was that the monthly subscription could be canceled at anytime. The app feels overwhelming to me and I want to cancel and it seems like I have to keep paying almost $30cad every month for a year. Not ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a serial procastinator, this app is helping me not procrastinate and feel amazing. I'm more productive, relaxed and overall happy. I go to bed proud of myself and what I managed to achieve each day. It's worth every penny!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far. Almost inspiring!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great concept... but this app, like its sister apps, doesnt know how to open the app from all the system notifications it pushes, which is super frustrating. Both fabulous, its meal plan one, and its ADHD app all do this. Im on android with a galaxy fold. Seems simple. Send notification to ask user to do a thing. Tap notification. Expect app to open. Annnnd....nothing. on all of their apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been good so far...but maybe just a single bedtime story for those on free mode...we could upgrade when we find it comfortingüòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I like it and I like that you can watch a video to get pro app for the day no money needed."

Welcome Back Jason! Have some unfinished issues to resolve and I won't quit this time üí™ I need to focus on my passions of what I enjoy to do! Lost my way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app but just upgraded my phone and had to reload the app- it seems like I'm starting from scratch and it wants me to resubscribe although I had paid for a year subscription... hoping the developers can help with this but not sure how to contact them?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Need to pay :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really enjoying achieving these small goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am finding routine take shape, especially when I do not want to do it. My bathroom was cleaned today without much thought. Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Data thief, don't install if you are looking for a free version.. they are just stealing our information at the beginning itself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for 24 hours and it is already helping me."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've had the app for 1 day and I love it. I have ADHD and a very busy life. This is already teaching me how to be better by telling me exactly what I need to do to build habits that will improve all areas of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A fantastic, well thought out and executed app for habit change rooted in self affirming, positive ground work. The daily coachings are eloquently woven into where I am in my progress, and inspire me to keep going. Tons of resources and tools for self reflection, meditation, wellness, and exercise. The layout is very user friendly and easy to navigate, and beautifully designed. I love Fabulous, and I appreciate that it's built and ran by a Duke University research-based team of real people!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you have ADHD, I do not recommend paying for the sub through their site. They do not send out any renewal reminders and will not refund you. I got the app after seeing it advertised as something to help with ADHD, and it worked well for a while, so I got the premium sub. After a while it wasn't working for me anymore and I forgot about it. I requested a refund once I saw the charge a few days later and was denied. They advertise to people with ADHD then take advantage of us if it doesn't work"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a SCAM! I cancelled and they confirmed I cancelled and then CHARGED me ANYWAY! DO NOT INSTALL!!!!!!!!!! So yeah...in response to ""Fabulous"" ... I've contacted you within 24 hrs of installation to ensure it was cancelled. You said 2 times it was and then charged me ANYWAY! No such record on my Google play account and I've contacted YOU many, many times while you no longer reply you are blaming Google and refuse to refund the money you STOLE! I've contacted Google, PayPal and MY BANK!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helps me stay focused and organized! It is chock full of features and benefits that I work with to improve my day-to-day life! Plus it's user-friendly :-)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous üëå üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Few reasons for my 2 star review: First, the app itself, although a great idea, was executed very poorly. It's just pop-up after pop-up after pop-up with very little real substance. It has no widget to accompany it so it falls short there. WORST of all though is after you've subscribed to the trial, they make it a very difficult and complicated path to unsubscribe to their service. Only possible to do it through the website, and you can't login to the website the same way as the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app great for mental health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"if you dont pay $52/yr for premium version you get the pop ups asking to join/do a free trial, sometimes only seconds after each other. To add to the frustration, they put things you can only use with a subscription on the main screen, so you click on it thinking you can use it with the free version, then it brings the pop up again. I've gone back to this app multiple times over the past ten years, & it has less & less for free users everytime lol what a half-assed response"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would give 0 stars. I don't have the app or a subscription anymore and they still charged me $40. This is terrible *edit I was refunded but still upset that it happened"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Till now I am really enjoying the positive vibes from this application and how I have semi coach for my mental and emotional health. Nice app and great graphics and design"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Never seen an app so helpfull and affective in my entire life This app is just perfect No debate.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping up motivation and bringing a bit of joy into the routines. The morning and evening coaching is also very useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please be careful with this scam. They are wrongfully taking money from your account. They advertise a cost of 39.99 per year, yet when I went back through bank transfers, they have deducted a total of 193.99 Eur from my account on a period of 2 months. I have not chosen or used the 1:1 counselling they pretend they have charged me for, and I have not received a refund for the first payments. I found the use of this app not suitable for purpose either. Worst online experience with an app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app to follow kaizen technic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am enjoying the app and it's helping me reach my goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Like all things fabulous, this one is too good to be true üòî if i had that much money to spend upfront - after just one week's free trial - i would not have downloaded this in the first place üòî obliged to sign a contract with ""my future (unattainably perfect) self"" was/ is NOT a good start. Piling on even more guilt, anxiety. And no mention whatsoever of them delightful-looking 5-minute plans that drew me in. Shuda known better. Just another money-making scam (sigh) Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seriously loving this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It takes you on a journey at a slower pace. Unlocking more and more as you go on. It's different in this way to most apps like it. It's a much more manageable technique and I'm already seeing changes and excited for what's to come"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The helper for my mind"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Be careful with their free trial. I was charged after the trial without any reminder (my fault) but a poor business practice. I didn't even have the app in use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Thankful Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WAY too expensive. Don't these apps realize that the people that need help generally don't make as much as folks who don't?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I've been used this app and I feel the change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seemingly nice, yet bloated too oblivion and everything is locked behind a paywall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DON'T TRUST THEM!!! It says free and you can cancel anytime. But if you don't go specialy to the app store profile to make sure - you're still subscribe and they will charge you 40$ without you knowing! And when I ask refund they just asure me they won't charge AGAIN (but not refund!)"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: in three years they have continued to charge me a $40 subscription fee for an app that never worked for me that I have repeatedly tried to cancel Original: I don't get this app at all. About to request the refund before the end of the trial date. I can't get it to stop asking me to drink water. I drink gallons. The night time rituals are just 2 minute stories. I'm not seeing the benefit or it's just to confusing to figure out. How do I use this thing?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing, am beginning to see changes in my habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I gave this app a 5 star because it is part of a bigger goal. It works great for me because I get to check off only what I am able to handle. Pair this with other apps and you'll accomplish more of your goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Heart touching graphics Amazing visibility Heandy tracking system Useful coach guidelines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An interesting app for lazy people to help themselves overcome their fears, lack of self-confidence, socialization, and so many useful things to be the best version of themselves. I recommend this app for anyone looking for greateness and wisdom."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It took $62.99 from my account after I deleted it and removed my bank details"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helps to bring a routine into your life and help bring the inner peace in yourself, ive never meditated before and i think this is amazing"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this App !!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Undoubtedly the best self help app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The only thing that could make it better would be the ability to customize it more. Id est: ability to add own habits, routines, and times for habits. The app is very encouraging and has many coaching lessons. I highly recommend it. I now see where you can add a duration time to the habit. That is helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App works great, helps me makes small steps to drive big change. If know your thrive on routine but suck at setting and sticking to it, try this app. One very minor improvement I hope they make to the app is too add widgets."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pop up after pop up after pop up, definitely useless. Also is very difficult to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can make my own daily goals and be better structured. I love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice app for self improvement, it really helped me out. The only issue I have are the constant pop ups at the top of the main screen, advertising other apps and always asking you to write reviews. Edit: another star less, because managing (and cancelling) your premium subscription is made unreasonably complicated. When you click on the ""Manage subscriptions"" setting, you only get a message telling you to go to ""Fabulous on the web"", without providing any link to it. Still couldn't find it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very good app if you want to get in a few habits that will help you with your problems totally recommend üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Never, and I cannot stress this enough, never give your email address to this company. They will send you spam every day and unsubscribing won't do anything. The app is pretty much the same: it claims to want to help you change routines and habits using science, in reality it's just using science of marketing to get you to spend money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was desperate and downloaded this because of the marketing, but you have to pay to even see what it really has to offer. Don't bother. It's extremely generic advice you can get from anywhere. Go watch any Tiktoker or YouTuber who has reasonable content about how to change habits, and make yourself some checklists which actually work for you. You don't need yet another app you can't customise without paying extra."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Need to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üö®üö®üö®Just charged me $33 for an account I haven't had in years. Check all your accounts for similar fraudulent charges.üö®üö®üö®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really wanted to subscribe to the app, but it literally forces you to enter into a yearly subscription, which I didn't want to do. There was no other option for a monthly plan. So I uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am using this app from 2017 . And I love how the app itself has evolved over the period of time . It is really a great one , Try itüòÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Focusing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping yourself in check."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an excellent app to build good habits through persistence and repetition. It's worth the money for the value it brings :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unique app, should be tried first if looking for change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Maravilhoso √© realmente um coach te ajudando de manh√£, tarde, e noite. Meu guia"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buggy application, wrong settings for payment, impossible to communicate the problem because looks like people forget what coockies should do by default."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not working at all if not giving payment details, telling you AFTER they got your email address. This is not a free with in app purchases, but fully paid, for 1 year in advance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Rends agr√©able l'adoption de nouvelles bonnes habitudes √† un rythme facile √† suivre. Les enregistrement de coaching verbaux ne prennent pas trop de temps en restant inspirant. Ne semble pas r√©primander non plus si on saute une routine une journ√©e, donc ne d√©prime pas. Simplement du positif."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really does motivate you. Helps you listen to your inner voice instead of procrastinating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is helping me be mindful of my health goals and self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly...I'm BLOWN AWAY by this app. I rarely leave reviews but I have to because I work as a health coach and the content included in this app for the price is simply amazing. I'm left wondering who the heck put this together and how it's done so well. They use legitimate behavioral research, repetition, and small wins to motivate you along the way and it seriously works. Like anything, you have to stick to it and fine tune it to what your needs are...but the foundation is strong. 5 stars!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has worked great to help focus me, my time and cultivate my positive habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is actually great even without premium The aesthetics are on point with wonderful stories 10/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a superb well-being and productivity enhancing app that acts like your friend, philosopher, and guide if you let it and decide to take its stewardship in your daily life sincerely. I truly enjoy my premium membership at Fabulous. The sense of organized control over the day that this app has brought is mind-blowing. There is soothing music, motivational short stories and quotes, stunning graphics, and an overall user-friendly interface that make it very easy and enjoyable to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Want to try for free, but you can only have 2 habits. Want to access daily reading, you must pay, Want to try anything? You have to pay. Do something well, you get an email about paying for the app. After 3 days, I got so many paywall requests I dumped it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivates you in unexpected ways!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware. I signed up for fabulous for the free 1 month trail which stated I could cancel at anytime and not be charged. I made sure I cancelled before the month was up but was still charged. Grrr!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun & Entertaining"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many features behind paywall. Can't add more than two things to a list. A notes app is more useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A slow start to big habits. And I'm successfully reaching my goals without feeling overwhelmed. Also! This app is so much more than help with a daily routine. There are challenges for mind, body spirit and even a little beyond. I have found support in the fabulous communities and groups. So many hidden gems in this app it's more than just an app. If you're thinking about trying this I highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I didn't realize that just taking little steps would make a big difference. I've tried all kinds of apps, and this is really easy, motivational, and inspiring. Thank u, Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't like all the new age jargon I just want the help and not to feel like I'm being indoctrinated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps uplift my mindset,and steer my focus to positive,""Very Cool"" ,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app is useless, gives u a lot of flowery motivationaly intros just to put pretty much the entire app behind a pay wall? like not even some of features, wasted my time im so disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"(Been premium from the start,so rating the premium experience) This app is gentle but gives plenty of rewards to encourage you to start building routines. The suggestions of the app are helpful in a way that does not feel forceful- love it and it has genuinely helped me improve my life and build habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I first used the app when it was brand new, and decided to try it again. I'm disappointed that it is a lot more... narrow. It forces you to start with drinking water every morning. Okay, not a bad way to just start. Then it forces you to eat breakfast. I don't eat breakfast and I have never liked breakfast. It is not necessary for everyone and some even have medical reasons they don't like or can't even eat breakfast. I guess it just isn't for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this application well over a year now and i would say this was one of the best decision i took. Fabulous has been my buddy. Keeps me in check at managing my time, resting well and much more. Thank you Fabulous Team for this initative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A fabulous reminder every day to becone your best self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works dude"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this App! Since I got it ive remembered more, created healthy habits, and I'm a lot healthier than when i started. The only reason i dont give it 5 stars, is because you need to pay $3 a month to set more than 2 reminders for a routine, but ither than that, amazing!! Definitly reccomend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a good app, but I think it would be so much more useful with some handy widget options, including being able to scroll through your daily habits on a home page with adjustable sizes and being able to check them off from there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helped me out of my chronic depression. I've been using it for a little over a year and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially anyone dealing with mental illness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app out there.. undoubtedly the best!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I dont know why my coaching session voice is breaking too much j don't know what the issue is ...please help..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a fraudulent company. They have charged my credit card for a yearly premium even though it was removed from Google Play. The subscription doesn't even show in the app. There is a no response from the customer service. Please do not give your credit card details to these dubious people & lose your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful goes slow at first but that's good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app really wish I could afford it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to create routine build life changing habits have a more balanced and structured life also a great way to look and feel fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pleasant, motivating, challenging goals that aren't too complicated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly have had such a positive experience with this app. I do pay for premium, because for me it's worth it. I sucked at establishing a routine and this app has helped so so much and I can plan mindfulness and mental wellness right into the routine as well which has helped my mental health greatly! Thanks Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly ignored this app and the notifications on my phone for it. It sat taking up space on my storage. And finally, I began truly using it this has been the most insightful and inspiring app I have ever used! Truly the best app ever. FYI I never leave reviews so that's saying a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have enjoyed this app as it has helped me to adopt healthy habits. I really enjoy the coaching I get throughout the day and I love the animations that tell a story everytime you progress with a habit. I also like the tips that pop up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too bogged down with many pop ups and isn't straight forward. I need a habit tracker, not an over bearing motivational dispenser."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Quality"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle but effective messages, liked the way small steps at the time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using the app for a week now and I am loving it. My favorite part being those 2 minute articles with quotes from Rumi"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very helpful app in your daily life and motivating letters and goals to make you happy and have a good day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have just started this app, and it does really well with starting better habits. It also limits you from taking too many steps at once, which helps the pace for finger lasting results."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app no purchase necessary and it actually sets alarms and reminders to make sure I'm on top of whatever which is FABULOUS because I can't remember anything.. love this app for sure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really wanted to use this along with my daily planner app Yoodoo, but couldn't get into the swing of it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I didn't expect the creators so considerate and give you a daily ad instead of of a subscription, which is so nice if them! It's a lot better and free-user friendly than other ""planning, change your life"" apps and just better in general. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a fraud, I enrolled in 7 days trial, cancelled in 2 days, yet after a week,they charged automatically. In play it's showing cancelled. Eventually you will not be able to connect with them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app ‚ù§ but I hope if it was freeüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠because I don't have money üíî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried it. Canceled it. Still charging me for the app canceled before subscription ended. Now to the I have to have my bank fight then."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for it and it doesn't seem as customizable as it should"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"At first I didn't think I would get a lot from this app. I thought it was a glorified to-do list. But I have developed better formed routines that support healthy habits, and I can fully attribute that to Fabulous ü§© ETA: I got closer to a year streak, and my streak count kept getting reset to numbers I couldn't go back to adjust. I emailed them, sent all the screenshots asked for, and it happened two more times. No response. Very disappointing for someone looking to feel good about progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very mindful and helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a cool app but my alarm isn't working. Aside that, I love everything about the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I really like the idea but im at the point where I'm afraid to even spend a bit on a luxury. I was excited for the free version but it wasn't much, im sure if you have money, this app would be nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel there is so much you can get from this app if you remain consistent. I'm really enjoying it and feel it is helping me on my inner growth journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very excellent app really aligns you and creates a better you"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enablr"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really enjoying the app. But still figuring our how to best use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"At first give users a chance to use your app at least that people understand what is thet and what about. And after that force them apply subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Customer service"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best app for rountine but their is only to take two option but it is perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not take free trial up as they take you money from your account when you don't want to carrt on with the year. They ignore your messages when you ask them to refund you. Bad customer service. The app was not for me and I wish I never tried it as now ¬£34.99 out of pocket."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is what I try and do for myself all the time. Just the extra reminders and animations to focus on progress and forward motion are fun and motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I appreciate the pacing and intentional prevention of overwhelm."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ƒ∞ like it, i mean i kinda wish it would all be free but yk that's not how it works üòÖ and the app is quite encouraging and friendly and helped me step by step. ƒ∞t isn't like completely Lƒ∞FE changing obviously but it's simple and def helps to get your life back together :) then again I'm only doing this free, there's also a paid version with more ƒ∞f you just want a bit of help and encouragement to get back on track, this is the app for you Over all i reccomend"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is great ! an enjoyable session"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only had fabulous for a few days. So far it's great. I would give it five stars, but I haven't had it long enough to justify a five-star rating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great starter to change bad habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best app I've used so far to help reach my goals and manage my life better. It's all about those baby steps. Change doesn't happen overnight and Fabulous teaches you to be consistent and hold yourself accountable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Subscription screen in the app is so buggy that I could not pass verification after trying 3 times. Finally subscribed via the website for a trial of 7 days. Now I am anxious to get billed quadruple at the end of the week. Not a nice start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very inspiring app....has made a difference in my day. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only used the app for 2 days, but it's helped me get my morning, midday and night routine aligned with my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm 2 weeks in and really enjoying the slow steady buildup of good habits. Starting and ending my days intentionally with small, helpful actions sets me up for peaceful days and restful nights."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to unsubscribe I don't want to be charged anymore because this does not work for me and I don't know where to capital letters unsubscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app offering a good life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is intuitive and easy to use. I like that it is forcing me to slow down and make incremental goals, setting me up for success down the road"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great baby steps to build good habits. Not annoying or overwhelming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Been trying to contact customer support for nearly 2 weeks. Was told ""up to 7 business days!"" But it's now been 10. I am receiving charges to my credit card that I can't cancel and it isn't an issue that can wait for whenever they feel like it. Was going to keep the app because it's cute but at this point I'm going to have to call my credit card company or something to block charges from this company because this is ridiculous. So yeah don't bother trying to contact customer service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Pretty enjoyable experience if you have the money for premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"wanted to try the free trail but it gave me hell trying to cancel it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I appreciate the baby steps, but I would like to be able to set my own goals or tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cancelling was too difficult a process. One email to fabulous, 7 chats with the google team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I haven't had this stupid app installed for 11 months and now I'm being charged for a membership? Don't download this it's a scam and you will be billed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun app, like a game but with your habitsü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful resource! When you need help and need a place to start. The support and reminders are great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is Awesomeeeeeeee ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I genuinely enjoy this app. I struggle most in mornings to take my medicine and eat breakfast while chasing kids around. This app has really helped when it comes to getting in a routine where I won't forget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like how the reminders help me towards my goals. Also the coaching that's offered is tailored toward my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps me keep track of some healthy habits that I don't want to skip on a daily basis. Also enjoying the short coaching sessions, that I play right before sleep or sometime during the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I paid for the full yearly subscription thinking I'd use it but the app design is just too overwhelming to use on regular basis, completing tasks opens up an inspirational video of 2 minutes so you need to leave everything you're doing and spend those minutes on your app for a task you do everyday like drinking water. I like the gist and i downloaded it but simplify the app please, it is too much info all at once to be able to function with people like me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good experience to have. Just believe in yourself and follow this app's instructions regularly. Wish you a beautiful and prosperous journey!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the way it helps me take it enough liquids eat a proper breakfast get some exercise. I also like the prompts to get things done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exciting, easily, very personal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Trying the free trail, really like it so far! It's new and different from other habit tracking apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've tried to get my subscription funds back, and they won't even respond. I canceled it before the 7-day trial was up. 9/23/23 BEFORE I posted the review, I did go the help the site you are referencing, and I have still not received a response from you via e-mail or a refund to my credit card."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app available on planet ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a good free experience. The app pushes for you to pay. 9/21- Most features are subscription only. The free experience is basically unusable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not authorize this payment I would like a refund....and I did reach out to you and you told me to reach out to Google. Someone needs to refund my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Answer 40 questions to get a simple day planner and after wasting 10 minutes in an effort to better manage my time I have to pay to do what I can do with a piece of paper and pen. No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive and motivating. Feeling more relaxed about it on the second time around, and I believe I'll stick with it far longer now. The concept of breaking goals down into much smaller parts is of course brilliant and well expressed in this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tool that helps meet track my daily goals and check them off as I go. It has helped me establish some healthy routines for myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it! It starts slow and builds, with really important but simple steps, motivational but not too cheesy, also very enjoyable experience with the colorful and fun way everything is done! There are also some optional things if you want to do more, like daily meditation audios and eye-catching inforgraphs with helpful sugestions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been on it for about 5 days, so fat so good, very helpful to keep me focused. Still on the Fabulous app, and it does what it says on the tin, it is FABULOUS!! So far, I've started loosing weight, started exercising daily only 15-20 mins, but I struggled doing 5 when I first started. I feel so much better about myself and my life, I absolutely love it. The small challenges it gives you, I want to carry them on. I exercise everyday, I'm 4 days off 30 days immenent fasting, and loving myself more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BE CAREFUL - DECEPTIVE SUSCRIPTION CANCELLATION Just to be clear, I am writing this review AFTER working with their help center. Extremely deceptive practices. To be specific, beware accepting any discounted extension offers. It's a trap!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I couldn't even get through the setup. How do I identify? The human race is non-binary. None of the three options offered are identities I'd care to endorse for myself. Gender is toxic. My feedback is to ask, ""why do you need to know sex or gender at all? Why even ask?"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"6/6/17 I love this app. It's the best thing that I chose to do as a part of my recovery! 2/5/20 back at it, this time paired with Noom. 9/21/23 and again I resubscribed, as I'm dealing with stagnation in my life. I need to get some new, better habits in my life and I know for a fact this app will help me, it has in the past and it will for me again, now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Could use some more features"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"UwU"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a really fabulous app. The overall mentoring by quotes, messages, audios as well as videos is awesome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It looked like it could be very promising but is unfortunately paid, so I will not be using it. There is a free trial available for anyone who wants to just try it before buying, which is nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very warm and cozy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!! This is a path to better you.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a fun app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my account months ago and they charged me the $39.99 for a premium account that I don't have. I have evidence that I canceled the account. They charged me for premium around 9/18/23 and I requested a refund, they refused that request, and I logged in to their app on 9/20/23 and got the message telling me that I would have to resubscribe to premium. They stole my money and didn't even provide the service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just disappointed a lot of the most helpful traits of the app cost money but the free traits have helped as well would be even more effective if it was more tangible for those who don't always have the extra money to spend for the app I know it's not much but with today's economy apps like these help tremendously just unfortunately cost money like everything else"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps with me becoming more discipline"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still in the one week trial period, but I wish there was a free version and paid version so that this could be more accessible. They give you guest passes to share with others, and they're kind of pushy about it. I wish I could have had one of the guest passes for myself! I'm also not interested in spamming my friends with something I have only been using for 3 days! despite those gripes, I'm still finding it helpful. I am having to resist adding too many habits at one time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun to produce and use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app to start making gradual positive changes to habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Despite paying a subscription I keep beeing bombarded with this bothering requests to rate the app. Would give a proper rating if it wasn't for the constant nagging and bothering with reviews and whatnot. If I'm paying for an app I expect all the wretched propaganda to be gone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is very efficient n made creatively"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It looks weird. Everything is behind a pay wall. The first habit it gives you is to drink water every morning, but I already do that and there's no way to choose something else."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is great, everything is laid out, not too hard to navigate and get a feel for what you want out of it. The idea itself is very interesting, and I'm glad it is something that is being worked on in this day and age. However, I found it difficult to decide if I wanted to stick to it in an yearly subscription right off the bat, and 7 days trial is too little time to get the right feel for the app. The journeys are difficult for someone starting out and seeing it go further would be nicer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying it. Not every bit if it maybe but I have not customized it yet. I haven't had the app long enough to give it a full confident 5 stars. Using paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a very heavy app, that does not provide the content advertised when motivate you to pay for a membership. It supposed to have complementary content, that when trying to read/access to it, it only displays a blank screen, and it is impossible to contact support from the app. Overall really disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wasn't sure about it at first, some things seemed cheesy. However, listening to encouraging coaching morning and evening. Checking things off daily.... it felt good. Better than I expected. I found myself actually listening and absorbing the coaching. Things I thought were dumb. Like water. What. Water, really? No, water! Simple steps that lead to bigger things. This is for you, to make some changes. To dive deep into discovering what it is you want for yourself and the process of discovery"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Although I'm not always consistent and struggle it does help me feel more calm, focus and capable of achieving small things. Everything is small things in the big picture. Thank you for this app. I appreciate the coaching too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loev it. So positive. Can't believe. Addictive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a great app to kickstart good habits. But long term use is difficult. I really wish there was cloud sync for this app. I hop between my phone and tablet while working from home and the fact I can't have the same progress on multiple devices is a deal breaker. While reorganizing my phone home screen, i accidently deleted the app and now upon reinstall, i have lost all my progress. Thank you for helping me develop good routines, but the fact I've lost my progress moves me to another app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It helps me stay in the the present."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is FABULOUS!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I liked the goals, journeys, habit tracker, & everything but I couldn't post my story or how I felt .. which is my main reason for having it. So it was pointless for me to continue with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good it helped me to productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful to get into a routine. I have not used it for long, only 3 days, but there is definitely improvement in my mood and productivity. Also the App is very rewarding! A few minor technical things are still to fix, but nothing that's disturbs my flow so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wth i want my money back i cancelled the subscription and it still tool 20$ from me K WANT IT BACK"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very fabulous app but most of things are paid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for planning and executing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app. I genuinely think it can help me be a better version of me. I also love that it is still accessible to those who may not be able to afford premiums."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Manipulative signups and annoying fantasy-novel graphics. There is no free trial. I paid $1 to try it out, immediately hated it, and canceled. I feel like a sucker. It wanted me to start my journey by drinking water. I drink a ton of water already."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helping me reach my daily goals and stay organized! Thank you so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app! Worth every penny! Start changing your life now !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still in the early stages of using the app but so far it does a great job of helping to start habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the design and how organized it üëåüëëüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is amazing. Just from day one of trying out the challenges, I have already made significant changes in my life. And don't get me started on the audio files. The voices are so soothing. I think this is the best thing I've done so far. My only problem however is the need to get premium before you can do anything significant. That's a huge bummer ‚òπÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to add my own tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is good but we have to pay so I'm not being able to use it üíî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty great! So far, the app is doing great. It reminds me when I snooze my to do list, it reminds me even further later that I haven't done what I should've done. It has a great group chat, that makes me feel like I am not alone in my struggles and there is hope. It can't force me to do stuff, but it makes me feel good when I do, it even does happy little chimes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"guys the music on the first time start is too loud, I had to uninstall the app to disable the floating heads, on the first time start it needs to ask all the questions before allowing me to restore my progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you have to pay for things in an app, it might be useful to note this before someone fills in all the questions. I deleted it right away when I was ask to pay. I didn't know it was an paid service. Now you guys got my email address and I don't even want your services. Sadstory. App, if paid, sound interesting though. Too bad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I will give a full review after a month, currently, it's been a week. A very encouraging app with coaching that helps instill a mindset for more positive and productive outcomes. My only qualm is that it is very difficult to find something I have closed out of because time might not have allotted for it right then and there. I need the app to be more flexible with my schedule. I work evenings, so my breakfast isn't going to start in the mornings. Maybe tailor better to the user."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love learning new tips and tricks. It has been an amazing journey and I am getting energy everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for me Thank you üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Overcomplicated, does not solve my simple need - track existing habit. Adds unneeded habits from the begingn I didn't ask for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app but it seems to only be compatible with Apple watch i would for it to also be compatible with my Google pixel watch especially since I'm fully switching to it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Where are the to do lists!? I don't see anywhere within this app any of the pictures advertised in this app!? I mean it cool if you want these ""journeys"", but I wanted a space for to-do lists, as advertised."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep on top of reaching your goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very uplifting!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You Help me Sio Much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't believe how efficient this app is, I've been using it since last year and it really comes better every time, now I'm less stressed, I'm building discipline and good habits because of this. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is amazing App. It motivates me in a wonderful way. By using this app my life has become less chaotic. There is just one problem, which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5, which is that there are no other languages ‚Äã‚Äãavailable other than English. This would have been much easier for speakers of other languages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not usable unless you pay or have credit card connected to google store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Worth the membership."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works, if you really put in the effort!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is okay but the free trial and cancellation process is ridiculous. They tell you that you'll receive a notification reminding you about the premium account, since you have to enter card details. I never did. I had already cancelled the trial, but one wrong click in app and I had unknowingly re-subscribed to premium and it's cost me 70 bucks. The app isn't helpful enough for me to consider a premium account and now I'm fighting for a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful now I'm more focused on my goals and love seeing others having that same thought"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Update September 2023: I'm retrying and hopefully will have better luck this time. I'm hoping to follow through longer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It brings the kind of mindset and attitude we need in life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not the best idea to provide Ernest Hemingway and Winston Churchill for inspiration (both were alcoholics, and Hemingway committed suicide)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just another greedy business venture. Do not fall for the free trial, it a trap."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience. I love spending time on this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"UI is great. Ux is bad. Too many things, too many colors too much confusion. Also, the trial, subscription amd other aspects dont work properly. Please qork om these to make it a good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm using the for 2 days and I'm having a great experience so far. I hope it continues like this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The first question on the site asks whether you have ADHD, so the Fabulous team clearly purport to have knowledge in this area. One of the challenges people with ADHD often report is forgetting to cancel subscriptions (the ""ADHD tax""). So it is COMPLETELY UNETHICAL that they don't send reminders to subscribers before automatically renewing and deducting overpriced fees from user's credit cards. Should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage and capitalising on our difficulties"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just thought it was bland, and not really what I wanted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not paying for this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is incredibly useless. It starts out with some good habits but becomes more of a chore. The coaching sessions repeat so you hear the same coaching over and over. The circles also post the same 'inspirations' and after a while it's so tedious and repetitive. The habits reset from the beginning if you just miss one day, there's no opportunity to freeze or pause your progress, so its a terrible app for people with issues like depression, anxiety, etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am not really into it yet but it seems good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very uplifting experience having daily reminders to better yourself... And help obtaining a fabulous life... This app is amazing!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me motivated and it's light and fun. I highly recommend it for personal support!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been a long time user of the fabulous daily routine planner. I feel like with each new phone I get a whole new journey & chance for a fabulous fresh start. it's definitely worth trying especially if you are struggling as the prompts for each journey start with small steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small changes every day is the only way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I may only be three days in.. But this has kickstarted an entirely fresh approach to my days and what I am doing with my free time. I worried it would be too ""Live Laugh Love"" but it's anything but that. I hope it remains to be as helpful as it has been so far in months to come."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everytime I start to lag or notice I'm just... not with it I come back to this. It's by far the best app for habit formation that actually sticks. Not too abrasive. Only support. The one thing I can do now, habitually, is get up in the morning. Now focusing on sleep health. The tasks are tiny but they add up. Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So handy, perfect for the ADD mind"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have used the app for a very short time and cancelled my subscription through the website only to find out I've been charged $39.99 today. What the heck, people?! And even then, as I reinstall it and try at least see what I bought, all I see is the same ""free"" version with an offer to purchase Premium AGAIN(!!!). Explanation would be kindly appreciated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I paid the annual subscription and used this app for perhaps 2-3 months before realizing it wasn't effective for me. Part of it is because it's not organized or structured in a way that's easy for people like me to digest easy habit tracking. Coaching is also something that's obnoxiously spammed, and there's no way to disable the notification. It has a lot of filler and for an app that's ""editors choice, you'd think it would be more organized. Use Loop Habit Tracker instead. it's free and good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app fr"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly the habits are so clearly doable!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use, very good graphics and inspirational work is fantastic."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"First, no trace of the organising sheet in the ad. The rest is a nice, colourful mess. I get the intention, but everything is laid out in an unintuitive way. I wanted an organiser (as advertised) not a slew of motivational speeches, videos, cute animations. Did the ""journey"" for a few days but didn't do much for me..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great habit tracker and motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"There is just so much to unpack here. I'm going to have to stop seeing my psychiatrist now that I have daily help to improve my life (that's really not why. It's because he is out of network with my new insurance). This app is so helpful for newly disabled people who have no idea how to transition from working all of their lives to staying at home. Especially if they live alone. I'm glad I found it. I've been floundering for 6 months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Many things require premium and it is costly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an incredible app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't subscribe. I am getting error with this application. But I can subscribe another application."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so nice üòª it's help to done proper way in my life ü•≥ it's so enjoyable üî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sketchy / non-existent design ethics. I have not used this app in a long time. I recently received a charge for an annual subscription I already cancelled. It has been a massive hassle trying to get in contact with the Fabulous app customer service. The support chat says it sent an email to confirm my ticket submission, but it never did. These guys work under the radar to quietly charge (or even double charge) previous customers and hope you don't notice. They avoid you if you do notice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the habits u do Goals and mediations are great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far its doing good for my scattered lifestyle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worthless app will charge you after you cancel trial. I did the free trial and found the app was worthless. It literally did nothing but say to drink water first thing in the morning. So I cancelled well before the trial ended. They charged me anyway and after spending over an hour trying to get through their automated chat (because there is no way to contact support) I have to wait days at a time to get condescending messages demanding screenshots from canceling over a month ago. Stay away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"don't look at reviews. just go through it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a fabulous app! Much praise.Try it for yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Please please PLEASE return the dark mode!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Go Tar Heels"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Can alway be better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it it has daily and nightly coaching on it and it's great for mental health I love it so much and I recommend it to anyone who wants to start their fabulous journey and they don't have the app yet this app is amazing and I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who does not have it yet and would like to start a journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Wish I could just pay and not wait the 7 days"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love having structure and a plan in place especially for work, but this is an amazing app to help me stay on point and focus on completing my daily tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty simple yet extremely helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have noticed an improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm liking it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping Me a lot, and I'm only on day 3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, it's helping me to stay off social. Instead of anxiety from social media I'm starting to be more focused on taking care of myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's just a scam to get you to subscribe. You'll input all kinds of personal things just for it to prepare to charge you. So dishonest"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the coaching sessions!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"cool. But only English available, and no blue dark theme. Add Kazakh language please."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have been using for about a week. I love it, have already incorporated some healthy new habits into my life. 100% recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Uts fabulously amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am only about a week in but I like it so far. It's an innovative approach to habit formation very closely aligned with Atomic Habits, which I enjoyed very much. In fact, if you read that book, and use this app as a direct, functional extension, you are likely to be very successful in changing your life. I'm just getting into the coaching, but that seems good so far as well. I'll update my testing as I go, it could still earn five stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivational and a good way to help keep me accountable for my bad habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started my journey couple of days ago. Who knew little things like drinking water in the morning, Taking the time to be grateful and reading would help this much. Next thing i knew i was planning my days with positive habits like exercising before eating lunch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still quite new to the app. But I'm already getting a good feeling using it. I struggle with my mental health and the Fabulous app is southing my mind, with tasks and ideas for small changes throughout my day. Think this is going to be a real breakthrough for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Way, WAY better than I anticipated. No, for real, it is so good! Fabulous has made a positive difference in my life and I am so glad I found it. Thank you to the creators. üíóüíóüíóüëè I highly recommend this to everyone. Yes, you should. Try it. This one's different. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything costs money and must be premium to access. So dumb üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a well made scam! The app is aggressively trying to pull from you subscription with card details."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only app that I've been able to stick with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A new approach"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a rote, unpersonalized package that literally picks your goals for you. As in, you have to ""achieve"" drinking water for 3 days before you can even use the app in any other way. Essentially they are manipulating you into a path so that you are strung along trying to figure out if there is anything useful, which you cannot do during the 14 day trial period. It's a bit of a scam and a complete waste of $16, which is not trivial for a 2week trial in which you get no functionality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautifully created. Clearly there is an AI influence, put your prejudice aside. Based on the principle, ""any journey begins with the first step,"" and ""the slow, step by step methodical tortoise beats the hare's bounds, which misses out all the important little steps."" From Day 1 my confidence and sense of self worth started to grow, leaving a feeling of peace through a welcome sense of achievement. Thank you Team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app will surely transform me into new me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"You should mention that the free version is basically a demo. Can't do almost anything with this app if you don't pay, for 90% of the features will show you a big a$s pop up telling you to get premium. 2 stars just because the art style is cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One thing to note is you do have to pay in order to used this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Fabulous! I've tried many different apps to help me build routines and support consistent habits - this one by far takes the cake. Everything focuses on self-care instead of achievement. As a person who has struggled with focus, this helped me so much! It's encouraging & supportive, the interface is simple and pleasing, and most of the basic habits are already built in to easily add to your daily routines. I also love that I can create my own custom routines and custom habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so far. It's exactly what I needed to make the changes I need to make!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this may be may first app review ever. It's a good app, better than others I had. Really worth trying. It takes some time to adjust it to your needs, but I like those slight gratifications I get along the day. Some days I don't even want to look at the notifications, but eventually I'm getting through it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am extremely disappointed in the poor communication on this app. It is very difficult to unsubscribe. I have paid for three years now and have not used the app. My e-mail has changed since I applied for premium and I can't access the app on the old email as I can't remember the password. I have sent many emails with NO reply - Even if I want to use what I have paid for, I can't and nobody has replied to any of my requests."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app , but if it was free it will be so so great because its a great app and very useful ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Draws me in... delightful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't unsubscribe through the app? Can't unsubscribe through Google? It's like a f$%&*# gym membership over here, but the equipment sucks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is simply Fabulous üòÇüôåüèΩ I'm on a verge of developing a habit intentionally üòÖ, I like the work in behavioral studies that has been weaved into the creation of the application, I like that they make me feel nice for my small wins, the stories on the journey reinforce the craving for me to keep winning üòÇüôåüèΩ Get Fabulous Today!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Pretentious. This app is so, so, so pretentious. I couldn't handle it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really Love This App, it's very motivating and encouraging. It starts out with small, easy habits and helps you remember to practice them, even give you tips/advice on how to be more successful at following thru with them. I Truly believe that this App could be Life Changing if you are Determined and can Follow the Steps in it!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love This app its so niem ce and so sepret its helps me alot thanks for tu s app you made its amazingüíóüíìüíûüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool tool to help create and reinforce healthy habits. So far, albeit being 3 days into, I love it. It engages you and uses science and psychology to solidify healthy routines in your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please refund my fee. I've tried t get a refund through the app several times and I'm not getting it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it requires you to commit financially before even letting you explore the features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love Fabulous! It helps keep me on track with the things I need and want to do every day. It helps keep me motivated! I highly recommend it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory subscription methods."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great routine building app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My most favorite app at the moment. Glad I bought the premium. Worth it totally."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app, but like all things, you get what you put it. I've fell off my journey a few times, but this helps me get back on the horse."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Made me do all the questions. Then enter my email. Makes my account then says it wants payment. In that order to waste my time and scam me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What this app does isn't based on a complicated principle. You could do most of its features with a notebook and a coaching book. However your progress here is somewhat guided. As you buy the app you sign a little contract with yourself, as you learn your first routines the contract gets longer with every step. I still drink a glass of water every morning, even though it wasn't an important goal for me, but it was the first part of the routine, which holds these and myself all together."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thieves. When you cancel your subscription they continue to charge you, make it teeth pullingly aggravating to get ahold of them, and than out right lie and tell you they fixed it. Just got charged again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Unfortunately, doesn't fit in my budget, rn. Would like to purchase it for all my kids, but that's unattainable, rn."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has become my trusted ally in creating positive change in my life. It's more than just an app; it's a lifestyle companion that genuinely cares about your well-being. If you're looking to transform your daily routine into something truly fabulous, I highly recommend giving this app a try. Get ready to unlock your full potential and embrace a happier, healthier, and more fulfilled life with Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You get 1 week to use the app for free and then you have to pay for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing I have began a new journey in my life with the help of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes me smile x"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is very inspiring and useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far. I stay on track with drinking water, eating well and meditation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"No bad experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liking the simplicity of this app. üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really loved this appp. Its like having a personal coach. If possible it rate it 8 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying the app so far. It truly helps me to accomplish goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up, nice graphics and thoughtful coaching messages. Seems great so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sounds like a good app. However, what makes me hesitant to move forward with it is the required thumbprint to agree to the self contract. Since this app shares information with third parties, how do we know our thumbprint isn't being shared for nefarious purposes. Sorry, but I'll find another app that doesn't require this extremely private personal info."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded a while ago because of all the hype - makes you go through several hoops before cancelling your subscription (log in via web, can't cancel via app, strange UI) and support isn't helpful if you don't cancel before 24 hours. Kind of makes customer support meaningless if you can't reach out and get help for a month billed that you won't use. Honestly hasn't happened with another service before. I can understand it's in the T&C but lack of care from support is upsetting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deleted it after the first intro after they kept speaking about Michelle Obama. Balance and Insight Timer are better apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asking for my fingerprint during set up, you won't have it sorry. This gets deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've actually started to make change in my life. Who knew? All I needed was a little help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really really really love this app but I really don't like being asked to rate every day. Hopefully writing this review will make that reminder go away. A lot of people with ADHD or similar will be immediately distracted by this and diverted from taking their next step on the app. So surprised that they put in this annoyance because so so much thought has gone into the rest of the app. Lots of advice, tools and ways of thinking positively for people who struggle with that kind of thing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's only been a few days, but I am enjoying the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's just one rating. I will re rate after one month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for a week now and it is excellent at giving me the push reminders I need to help me form the routine of good habits that I believe will be beneficial to me. Let's be clear, your motivation must come from within, an app won't give it to you. However, if you have already decided that you want to make some positive changes then this app could help you gain and maintain momentum."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I just wish there was a way to get more without having to pay :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really dig the way this app helps build good habits. I am going to try to replicate this for myself using alarms on my phone for free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very effective at teaching you to implement new habits slowly in ways that will stick. Price is reasonable, I like that it's a once a year fee. Habits are customizable and timing is adjustable, and notifications are not intrusive (although my volume is always off)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"All they want is money now, used to be able to have 5 routines now just 2."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous its fabulous üíúüíúüíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't get on with this. I like its intention, but it's 2 heavy on the senses and jargon (2 many bright colours, random sounds & attempts 2 get u 2 upgrade). When I click on something it disappears & I have no idea what I was meant 2 do. The too- regular reminders come across as naggy which don't make me feel like being accountable, they just make me feel irritable and like deleting the app. Which is unfortunately what I'm going 2 do now. UPDATE: tried again 2023-still overwhelming for ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Always goes wrong and they never answer support messages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only started but really enjoying it !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm just a beginner with this app but it really works for me ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful for people who are easily diverted from their goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Long onboarsing process that is the exact same questions as the Me+ app. Like identical. And like the Me+ app you finally get to the end only to find out you need to give them your cc info to even look at the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Da mensajes muy inspiradores, es muy buena app para empezar a crear h√°bitos"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me withy day to day routine and much more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't afford to pay and 7 days free is too short not interested"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Unnecessary complicated to cancel subscription, not able to do so in app. Not very customer friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another ""free"" app that you have to pay to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uses a lot of manipulative dark patterns to create a false urgency to subscribe, and advertises an app that appears to encourage dangerous eating habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do you need my fingerprint? No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app,but please make a dark mode for it please."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems good, but way too many notifications. Tried changing all the settings and it would not stop bothering me. So many notifications that they become meaningless when you see the icon pop up, which isn't helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app, I'm enjoying it a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"just like the name fabulous üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"My first impressions are very positive. I gave the app four stars just to counter the emotional reaction in me with a modicum of skepticism. It seems to me that the app is based on a very simple but smart idea for habit formation: tracking. Even just tracking your performance makes it more likely for you to cultivate a habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the daily coaching, and gentle pace of the goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really don't understand why this app is so highly rated. I tried it twice and just felt like the routine it set up was to be on my phone all the time for checking in or reading articles. Also, canceling the paid subscription did not work the first time. I recommend when you do cancel take a screen shot of the confirmation that it actually canceled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Despite the price, I found that this app has been extremely helpful in getting my life together. Better than any other app so far, and I've tried a lot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wish it was free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love how my future self greeted me, was neat."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty cool habit building app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I've tried a lot of different ones before and was never interested long... I have sever adult ADHD so not many things work , so thank you thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great support for creating a healthier lifestyle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect üëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the daily coaching and all of the things fabulous has to offer. I find it helpful fun and motivational. I just may buy it again next year!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great approach to creat new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A creative way to establish new habits and thinking. Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They really improved the app since the last time I had it (6 years ago)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, beautiful design, love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that they help you step by step to change your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm 36 and just recently found out that I have ADHD & PMDD. This app has changed my life! What an incredible experience so far! This app has helped me build so many good habits, and all at my own pace. Thank you to all developers! My only recommendation would be to add material, resources, guides and/or groups etc to assist with PMDD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I insulated the app for 1 day then I remove it, and today after more than a week from removing the app Google pay did charge me with 669.99 EGP as an annual membership and I didn't have the app and didnt like it, I didn't add my card info to this app I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great personalise the mind map application ,I love it. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love how there are many things to do in the app. Love the nighttime and plans."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fabolous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. We started on step each time and that's great to learn how to embrace good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a very good app to build good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Worked wonders for my daily habits until I heard the nightly coaching narrator pronounce the Spanish word ""que"" like ""kwe"" and it threw me off so badly I've barely touched the app since."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just unistalled the app after using it for 2 months! Ads duplicate while you watch and 1 turns into 3. Reported to support weeks ago. I tried to turn my alarm off, and it wanted to have go through 3 ads, again. Just to turn my alarm off!!! I was really hoping to improve my habits with this app, but it's almost unusable due to the amount of ads you make me watch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Price for prime is good. I love the aesthetics on this app and the tools to self improvement. The thing I dont like and don't fund useful at all is the section Your Routines on the main menu cause I find it confusing and you can't really plan your day on that. You better just write down the tasks you hv in mind for that day. Overall it's a great app and I wanna keep using it every day üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!! It purchased a subscription through my G-Cash without my permission. And won't even give me a refund. Don't install this app guys. It's a SCAM. I HATE THIS APP I DIDN'T EVEN USED IT AND THEY'RE SCAMMERS. DON'T GET FOOLED. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° You don't even deserve a star!!!!! You're a gold digger app!!!! Shame on you!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Easy and fun to use. Very interactive and I see results after a few days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Mindful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Marvellous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually, I'm very impressed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me ha ayudado a tener mejores h√°bitos y la propia aplicaci√≥n me motiva!. No tiene anuncios en exceso y te permite un uso muy orientativo sin ning√∫b tipo de dificultad. La primera aplicaci√≥n de h√°bitos que realmente me ha funcionado."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much ads. Worst user experience due to poor business model and architecture style adopted by both production and marketing ends. Uninstalling it because of ads and consistently it asks for premium. There should be a free version with limited features. But current model is very much worst."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wish there was a free option. Unaffordable for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I will be displined,I will be more productive when I used this app, I believe everyone can do it, I very like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I feel robbed. If I could give 0 stars I would. I used it for one month, the stories were repetitive within that time, tried to get my money back, as it wouldn't give me a trial run I had to subscribe. you have to harass Google, which doesn't quite make sense I didn't pay Google to receive this I paid you guys. I didn't get it back, not impressed. you guys Robbed me. I forgot that even if you stop using the services you could be charged still, thankful I remembered before that happened."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The concept of this app was intriguing, but very shortly into it, it offers you a 1 week free trial, then you have to choose a subscription. Decided to read the critical reviews first, and glad I did. Seems there are too many having trouble canceling their subscriptions or being fraudulently charged. Be aware before you subscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thieves, I never even got to use this stupid app. Then there is no way to cancel unless I tell them everything. I will get you off my bank account... Don't give them your info for a free trial because it's just a hoax! They are going to take your money. stealing from people, nothing more. Google didn't give me an option for 0 stars, or I would have given a big fat 0 The good reviews are fake! I promise they are. Look it up!!!! Look up fakespot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cute graphics and easy to use motivation app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It approaches change as small, easy to manage consistent steps, attractive layout and design. I particularly like that the daily coaching sessions give you the option of reading it for yourself instead of listening to someone else read it aloud, so whichever way you learn best, you're covered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nearly everything I've come to learn about behavior change and behavioral psychology, this app has nailed perfectly on the head. From the way it teaches you to talk to yourself to the little stories it creates for you, all the way down to the actual routine changes it recommends. On top of that, the 3 coachings a day provide a really nice bite sized bit of wisdom that allows a shift in perspective. It's really important to actually do what it says. Fully commit and trust the process. Good luck!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful app I wish I could pay monthly as I can't afford to pay all at once"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautifully illustrated app, and it has made my mood go from bad to okay in a day. Helps you stick to routines of self care to make you feel better inside. There are daily inspirational stories and tasks, and it's personalised to you. Amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good for everyone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was enjoying for the first week, but then it would not progress on my journey even though I had completed the previous actions. The customer service response took an extremely long time and never fixed the issue. After over 6 weeks of not being able to do the journeys, I deleted the app from my phone. They have refused to refund me my money. Very frustrating and disappointing. I'm out $40 for an app that didn't work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for structure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really wholesome app. I enjoy how it always encourages you. Also the story mode is really entertaining which makes you want to stay in the app longer. I totally recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply, beautifully life changing thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The idea is cool but the app is kinda overwhelming, so many words, colors, and options in the main screen, I don't feel like I have the capacity to deal with it, especially when I'm tired first thing in the morning or before bed. I never feel like reading the lengthy letters, too. Also, the popup that's asking you to pay is so bothersome. I'll get premium of I want to, no need to harass me like that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"ü•≤I deleted this app for space but the backup option is only for premium users, so it demotivates me to use it all over again but I will miss it.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sounds great but the first think it did was threaten to charge me, procrastination resolved, apo deleted, time wasting solved, yes this app works within 10 minutes of install"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just starting out so can't rate 5 stars. We shall see. I like the structure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was very useful to change or adopt Good habits .It was amazing üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The words of wisdom and motivation they share as part of the app are absolutely wonderful and thought provoking! Great app. üòÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The first time I have made it more than 1 day with any of these Apps. This one supports and teaches you in the most Fabulous way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how they are different form other apps and give premium for a videoüëçthat's amazingüíñkeep going guys‚ù§üèÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great app but very expensive for my budget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't work for me, no flexibility in goals for a new mom. Couldn't skip the prompts that didn't work with a new baby, so I deleted the app and forgot about it. They just charged me again with no warning - no email, it wasn't in my Google subscriptions, nothing. Near impossible to cancel. Reinstalling the app to cancel only put me through prompts to create a new account/behavior plan with no other option or way to exit out of that intro cycle. Had to Google how to cancel it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm sorry can you be taken seriously if you think humans can be binary?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wish you could do a full 30 day trial before having to pay for it. This way I know it's worth the money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it. It's fairly straightforward, easy to navigate, and doesn't feel demanding. It's soft siggestions to help you develope routinenthrough out the day, especially if you haven't started. A couple things could be different in just my initial use. Food. I would remove it beyond reminders to eat. Also having more meditation options, stretching, but I am literally on day 3 so I will update later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is a great app it motivated me so much but they have to make more things for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous but I'd like to use it on my laptop."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for change life And best guide for yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far really enjoying this app. I'm only on day two but so far it's really helping me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self improment must use this app as quick as possible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: said they couldn't find anything even though I showed them proof of them charging my card for three days straight until they finally got me. Cash app didn't help either. This app is complete garbage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It was too complicated to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"User friendly! Easy to use and gives you a sense of accomplishment with what you personally want to instill into your daily routine. I love this app because it is like a helpful companion that pushes you in the direction of your goals. I recommend this app for anyone wanting to start a routine, habit or to get rid of previous habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used this app for few days and it has a good interface a lot of content and guides but I cancelled the """"free tria"""" because it didn't fonction well in my device as well as It didn't feel that useful too, after some days I found out that the annual subscription got billed from my bank account and when I contacted the support they said you signed up for that in the """"free trial"""" and it's not refundable, so be careful there's no ""free trial"" in this app and you'll get charged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After a horrible event I have had a difficult time getting back on my feet and climbing out of the deepest rut I've ever experienced. Fabulous, paired with a few other changes have really helped me to get unstuck, find my way back to peace, purpose, productivity, and living (and enjoying) my life. It starts small and builds, which is what people need to gain forward momentum. I've only been using this for a week, but I've already noticed a difference."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am a new user, but I absolutely love this app!!! The routine builder is amazing!!! I was never able to stick to one before but I desperately needed one!!! I need a routine to help keep my life straight and it has helped me so much!!!! Thank you as I am forever grateful!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel like Fabulous is helping me gain insight, direction, and hope. Once I've implemented some of their suggestions, I feel I'll be better focused and organized while reaching my goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this in Beta and loved it. Now I can't even create a proper routine because I have to pay when I want to add more than two goals. So frustrating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't install this app, I tried the trial, after one day's use decided to delete, I followed the steps to deactivate my account which was difficult, and thought I successfully unsubscribed. After a week they still charged me a year's subscription and I can't get my money back after even disputing it with Google. Paid a year's subscription and never even used the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app didn't help me at all. Plus, it asked for me to pay what I could to get started. So, I paid $1.00. Then this month I'm charged with $39.99. Even though I received no communication whatsoever about there being another charge. So I not only was NOT notified about being charged, but there doesn't seem to be a way for me to get my money back at all. Then, when you go to cancel this membership, you have to go online (not in the app) to cancel and there's prompts trying to get you not to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greatest self improvement app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent modalities and easy to stay interacted with. I am making progress in my mental and physical challenges on a daily basis."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have tried to make drinking water a habit. This is the only thing that worked to create the habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was very exited to use this but then when I opened the app and the screen loaded then it told me to type and I did not know what to type and mlr could I see what is was typing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory subscription-baiting. Enjoyed app years ago, returned to see if it still had the parts I enjoyed. I click out of first prompt to begin free trial and it decides I actually qualify for it to be cheaper. I deny it again, as I haven't even gotten in to use it at this point. Prompts again that the special offer wont be available for a YEAR if I don't take it now. One star purely for the audacity to try manipulate people like that, app itself is probably fine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good, still on the free trial...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am very happy with Fabulous, premium. Out of chaos I can feel some order emerging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really been helping"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Love the app and the concept, but sorry, I cannot give you my finger print."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just flat data mining."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíñü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's extremely confusing, I want to cancel the trials because Im pretty sure it signed me up to two separate ones and I cannot find where the other subscription or how to cancel it. To make all this worse, I can not find a single way to talk to an actual person so they can help me figure it out, it just sends me to a bot that has answers already listed for you and is zero help at all. I don't want to use this again based solely on the fact that it's hard to contact support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's honestly helped me understand how to schedule myself and allow myself to do things I've struggled with for a long time. I've gained so many more healthy habbits then when I first saw the app. Even if I don't open the app everyday your still able to start the habbits. Having the checklist or goals gives you a base line to experience the real you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"starts off promising but beware, it will automatically charge you when it ends your first period. then all you can do is cancel your subscription for the next year. I'm sure they have made a bundle this way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the small habits it is creating for me and the daily meditation like coaching messages. I feel it is helping me create small steps towards new daily routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èGreat app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It charges you to use it after 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love their stories and how encouraging their words are."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is just amazing.. you must try this app.. ‚ú®üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A bit too much advertising their own products for my taste but otherwise it's great product!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel subscription without an email chain spanning several weeks - customer service say they 'sincerely empathise' with the situation but won't refund a subscription that their glitches won't allow to be cancelled without threatening to escalate the complaint... Definitely not that fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how this app introduces habits in small bites and helps you to consistently keep to them by offering encouragements throughout. The coaching bits help to remind us of important affirming beliefs that we can incorporate in our practice. I also like that it not only asks you to build the habit but helps you by giving tips and pointers... eg if you're building exercise, the app has some exercises you can do. We'll done!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really good, however it's a shame you need premium for most, like the perfect morning routine. But overall very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am still navigating the app. It is cool so far. I wish there was a to-do list somewhere too, it would be cooler."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a wonderful app . I had used a lot of apps but the one that i really enjoy and help me become better is this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it motivates you to be more healthy and think about your health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the subscription and I haven't got the refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"NON ADJUSTABLE SCHEDULE. Despite being told when I wake up it has preset rhythm wanting to set reminders at hours inappropriate i.e. 9PM bedtime prep = 5 hrs before mine. Does not offer to customize, useless for CRD-DSPT. Not migraine friendly: It asks about ADHD ignoring executive and cognitive disfunction due to other medical conditions. The sounds are all higher pitched, lots of blue screen & pop ups. This could be just the intro but it's a BAD intro imo."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it almost impossible to cancel. Extremely difficult to contact them. Tell you to contact support but it's a bot. Very scammy. They renewed my subscription despite me trying to cancel. Many reviews say the same thing. Just give me an email address or phone number if you're not a scam. Be careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money money money ... üí∞ i hope you sleep better than me at night"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started using the app but find it positive and uplifting. I look forward to the short coaching sessions and to building new good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have tried other apps, this is my third time now to try again. The layout a lot better and it's easier to see what the next challenge. Still needs improvements on the layout. Too many boxes of other challenges. Just concentrate on one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly, a fabulous app. Thank you for the premium account integration with 7card."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. It's getting me building better routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best application in entire life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's only been a few days, but I love the inspirational words and the little daily steps that are leading to healthy habits. I feel inspired and confident without feeling pressured or overloaded towards positive change. Let's keep it going!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been really helping me after a Chronic Illness diagnosis"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is helping me to implement the goals I have for myself. With morning and evening coaching and gentle reminders throughout the day, little by little I am becoming more like the person I desire to be. The community is supportive. I recommend Fabulous to help build better habits and self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not worth the price for an annual membership."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it really has helped me get in a better routine and I know thier is so much to come with this insporational app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is very helpful, but I wish the reminders could be changed to act like an alarm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really enjoying the experience. Giving it four stars only because there is no Dark Mode."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The mere act of deciding to inculcate good habits and rituals can change your life and fabulous being on the side make the whole process much more easy, guided and achievable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"app looks nothing like it inside. no cute screenshots and i couldn't change the interface. must be a premium feature. without the premium it's pretty boring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im enjoying this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's honestly the best app, it makes me so product"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app and helpful indeed, but for trial the features are limited. You need to subscribe to get premium access. Anyway, it gives little help, thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"useless app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great app to conquer executive function issues, but BEWARE, you will be badgered to buy premium. CONSTANTLY. I'm rating this one star out of spite because the ""rate us!"" pop-ups are also killer. I know they need to make money, but waaaay too aggressive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app like your best friend..... It will definitely help you to bring changes slowly but surely .... ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bruh, how many steppers did you really think I needed to start the app? And no, I don't want to give feedback about why I don't want to drink water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yeah why not just do it! You will be doing yourself a favour either way!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I do believe the app is lovely, but don't think I can give it a full give stars because I have only had it for under a week"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app because it makes me feel brand new again and blessed!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it! Helps with my anxiety and I have been using it to help my social media addiction. Very calming app and helps with self esteem, productivity, so much stuff, it's soooooo good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app, it has made me be more mindful of the actions I take everyday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The 2 min coaching recordings get me motivated for the day & put me in a positive mindset. The narrators have upbeat, encouraging voices without being too perky. The coaching recordings are like gentle pep talks because they're motivating & soothing without putting me to sleep. Besides the morning coaching, there is a mid-day & an evening message. I listen to the 2 min. evening one before bed and it is calming, helps me unwind, and puts me in a good mood before I fall asleep."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just under a week in and so far this app is exceeding my expectations. There are sounds and visuals, but they're not annoying. Legit, valuable coaching messages. As someone who's BIG into personal development and who has tried *all* the apps for this sort of thing. I can honestly say that this is the best experience I've had to date. The approach is very gentle and encouraging yet powerful and effective at the same time. 10/10 highly recommend this app ü§ôüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, and an amazing tool. Ive just started but they do an amazi g job at not pressuring me and helping me go at my own pace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A very tedious onboarding. Can I not just use the app and play around with it? 20 questions, annoying sound, personal details and billing all before actually seeing how the app is?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 years later and I still enjoyed practicing my daily routine using this fabulous planner. I keep using it from time to time and it keeps offering great changes in my life every time I use it. Well done Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Only 3 days in and am beginning to have some positive affects. Can't wait to be the new me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Essential for growth, compassion and fulfilment ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love ittt"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely sound and graphic. And it works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am speechless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helping me pull my life together after her"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is one of the best apps I have come across."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Once you really use it, it is excellent for my productivity +"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not helpful at all, and they don't offer easy ways to cancel your subscription if you buy one. Do not recommend. I only put 1 star because Google Play won't allow me to put less."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Keeps me on top of my routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app. I am actually considering paying for it (this would be the only app I pay for, except Prime). 4 stars if more things were available in the free version (there's still plenty of good stuff they can keep behind the pay wall). I have a good feeling if I end up paying for it, the entire program will warrant 5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it's a $40 to do list and cancelling is super complicated and drawn out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's too loud can't even do anything it's making a lot of noise"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really liked the app, the contant is amazing, interactive and give motivation. The check list for the habits is awesome! The only thing is that the subscription is a bit high priced for an app but I think it worth it for your great health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!! My favorite things are the morning and evening meditations, but the is soooo much more to enjoy! Definitely worth it!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"How many habits can free users add to the routine as i see its not adding habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A good app for peace and productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Critical time consuming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great in theory. Tried adding habits to my morning ritual and got bombarded with the same advertisement about the paid plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Can be little more user friendly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"La aplicaci√≥n est√° s√∫per buena y realmente me ha ayudado. Es muy personalizable y esto es bac√°n. Puedes agregar h√°bitos personales o los que te recomienda la aplicaci√≥n, nunca te van a presionar con nada, respetan tus prioridades del d√≠a a d√≠a. Puedes ver tu progreso respecto a los h√°bitos que has conseguido mantener. Puedes personalizar si quieres alarma o no y a las horas que las quieres. Puedes tener variedad de rutinas y rituales diarios. Estoy avanzando con este apoyo, muchas graciasüíê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Damn it's so long to set up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a beautiful and simple way to remind myself to do the important things first. It's helping me see that you don't need to take on a huge goal at a time, just tiny pieces of it. Just showing up and being willing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I actually love that app. But it teases you with features you can't use unless you pay for it. Can I guess it's like I say the best things in life aren't free. It's just not something I can afford. So the free version only get you so far. So unless you're willing to pay for the app I wouldn't get it. That goes for the other apps they offer to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For many years I've been using fabulous whenever I needed help to follow a healthy and organised routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just started really if it helpsill updatemy review"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only 3 days in but already i have started a new habit that is beginning to help start my day better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like talking to an empathetic friend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is only my first day, and already, I am inspired!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You ask too many question. I won't pay for you. Neither I will use the ad version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"7 yrs later an ad hooked me again, but this time I lasted only minutes before uninstalling. There's something obnoxious about this app & its onboarding experience (including the chimes you can't disable), and it seems like I'd need to set aside a half hour just to get set up. Half hour later... I installed it AGAIN. I can set it up without getting frustrated...? Well, turns out I can't. Only lasted a few minutes longer before I got extremely annoyed with this app & uninstalled it a 3rd time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try it out but it's suspiciously unclear about what they offer if you upgrade to premium. The app pushes from minute zero to upgrade but they never disclose what you get in exchange for your money. The only thing I noticed was that I could add a 2nd task to my morning routine but when I tried to add a 3rd all I get is an ad to upgrade. It never says whether you can only have 2 tasks per routine as a free user and more as premium. Zero info on what you are actually buying. Uninstalled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's okay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"earn 5 stars more money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription last year and still got charged again this week, I contacted their support so far no answer. I suggest anyone who is reading this to not use your actual credit card with them if you like the app better to get a prepaid card and avoid the hassle. I am so disappointed. They are acting as a desperate scamming company now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app Helped me a lot in being punctual and obviously bossted my productivity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Using this is a task all on it's own. It has a nice interface, If you want tracking your routines to be an experience that gathers a ton of unnecessary data on you to share with third parties and costs $40 a year, this is what you want. It does a good job of being ""soothing"" and very ooeygooeymentalhealthy. I think I am not the target audience here. If you want to easily track what you need to do, without it being a whole production, get Daily. It is 99 cents forever and isn't a clusterf***."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app and got a subscription with the 7day free trial did not unlock premium used it for three days it looked like the subscription did not go through and tried it again still didn't go through, and said I'll try later,did not like that it didn't let me use the premium so I undownloaded , now it's trying to charge me the full year, when I couldn't even use the free 7 day premium! HOW IS IT THAT IT DID NOT PROCESS WITH THE SUBSCRIPTION BUT NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO CHARGE ME!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is not a routine planner‚Äîit's first and foremost a wellness app. The routines/habits were EXACTLY what I was looking for. But the ability to create new routines is locked for several days from new users bc it's ""too challenging"" to start too many habits right away. As someone who already has routines and just wants a more organized way to track & a little nudge to do them, this app was unnecessarily frustrating to get started with & the name feels misleading."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"LOVE THIS APP!! I am ""neuro-spicy"" and a therapist, and I have always struggled with time management and consistency. Fabulous makes it so easy to do both that I not only use it, but I recommend it to all my clients as well! Worth every penny and then some! Well done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for getting better and being productive many other uses must use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy using this app. I would love to see an option for different morning routines depending on the mood or day. Maybe my I'm-feeling-stressed-out/I'm-in-pain/... mornings need a different routine than my I-feel-amazing mornings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great interactivity; evidence-based strategies for forming new habits and routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoyable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. It helps me descipline - the thing I didn't make since years"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app very much, this app helps me in discipline , behaviour change, over come overthinking, gains confidence üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's really inflexible and forces you to do it one way, regardless of your needs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just incredible,it is honestly most of my motivation!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everyone who is seeking help in following routine nd looking forward to make it fun rather than a chore should have this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could not rate this app I would. First it asked for me to subscribe so I thought why not that's super fun, the app is cute. I changed my mind not to long after when I realized it asked for my PayPal information for the subscription, but when I noticed I didn't have the premium stuff, I tried subscribing through Google play, which worked. And now they've charged me through my PayPal after I've cancelled the subscription. I'm extremely upset. ü§Æ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Everything seems really cool...but it said firts week free then you have to pay. So..bye bye. The design is cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice reintroduction into the world and my life after Covid-19. Thanks. Still loving this app. Let's me take a private deep dive into my goals and ultimately my life. It is truly Fabulous and I am grateful for having it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Decent app, but it shouldn't be marketed as free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for anxiety"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes it fun to start new habits and set goals. I just started and have already reached a 3 day goal. There is so much to explore on this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I don't know if it's what im looking for or need in my life but it does seem like a genuinely well made app and program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very positive. But also confusing. Like today I'm at a score of 8. 8 what? To have personal coaching it's either 67$ or 87$. Per what? I'm on a journey or a ""track"" I dont remember choosing. And don't know how to change. And its congratulating for making new habits that I've already got. In other words, they are great at habit changing. But mediocre to terrible at app building and UI. It's pretty UI. Looks great. But I have no clue what's going on."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good at keeping my sporadic sel engaged. Im seriously considering buying the full subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app is so good i love this app make me helthy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I usually open these apps and shut them not long after because I can see they won't work for me. So far I've enjoyed the ease of the app, and the design and colours make it much more appealing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much, it has a piece of my heart. It is my comfort app when things aren't going right in life. Thankyou Team Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"8 days in and I appreciate the wisdom of this tool. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started last night, and I think it was a great decision. Wishing myself luck on this journey üåø"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is amazing app .and everyone can be useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tools!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much it has made developing good habits so much easier and more fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Prefect and enjoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great and best App out there"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far. Gentle reminders to break old habits, just enough to encourage small changes. Absolutely love the motivational speeches. Favourite part if the app so far. When I tap the notifications, it doesn't take me to the app. So small error there, but only one I've found."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Baby step is wonderful the messages are a bit overboard but üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the app so far - I especially like how immersive it is with the ambient music and the beautiful illustrations and animations throughout the app that ""reward"" you for completing the things you need to do to form new habits or to take care of yourself and your home. As someone with AuDHD, this app has been incredibly helpful and is like a little dopamine-hit-machine lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"***UPDATE 8/23/23*** *Still using the app all these years later. I still find that this app is great for time management, organizing life and the motivation to keep going! And the community is there to connect with and remind you that you're not alone with life's challenges.* (2016) Organization. Motivation. Great for everyone especially those with executive function difficulty."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app that I ever seen and use I love it. it help me alot in life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful it's difficult to cancel the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing on me and food journaling won't load. Struggling getting the app to respond to anything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i can't install the application, it always fails, even though the network is also good, the internet is also smooth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started using this app when I was feeling really bad about everything happening in my life, their idea motivated me to keep getting back to app, somehow I started to feel happier after 1week of using the app. Now every time I get back to app, it encourages me to be more active and use most of my time every day. I really like this app, it is very helpful for me. Thank you for your Fabulous appüçÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its awesome , inspiring and really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"eventho i couldn't afford the premium yet but i can still manage with the free one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful app i ever seen ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Email require. Deleting apps instantly that require email, use excessive advertising and pop-ups, or ask invasive questions. I liked the opening prompts. Was curious to see where this was going, but no."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love everything about it. Graphics, goals, messages, and mostly the simplicity of honest psychology. No manipulation. No noting. Just fun, easy help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"OK for free Downloaded after reading ana reticle about it. If you don't mind the constant prompts to go premium its pretty good. I'm enjoying it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app will transform the way you approach life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for building a routine and self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The time to tell me this is a seven day trial and not a free app was *before* I answered a ton of questions and gave you my email. Not after. I've got nothing against paid apps or free trials in general, but I'm not interested in using them myself. You should be upfront about that sort of thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app has proven effective for me in starting and maintaining achievable daily routines by gradually yet consistently reminding and encouraging healthy habits. Highly recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started using this app, and I absolutely love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è It has amazing tips, accountability, habit builders, support, etc."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving the app so far. This is a life changing experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The first app to actually help me. I wake up, drink water, eat breakfast, and go on a short walk every day now. Even when I don't feel like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First premium app that I'm committing to! 1 day into it and I'm really liking it's abundance of features and the art design is just so pleasing. Kudos to the developers!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very nice and I love the infographics"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its very nice and positive and it is truly the best app for helping you whatever you may struggle with,i tried tons of apps this is by far the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly and amazing app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ads are a shame. Would consider premium but not if being pushed/forced that way. Before learning how to focus and meditate, you need to watch an add about a video game. Lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using this for a few days but so far it's been wonderfully motivating. I love the layout. It takes some getting used to but it's very easy to navigate after a few days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gatta pay for anything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazingüòç app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had this app on my phone for over a year and never opened it once. Then one day I decided to open it and, WOW! I am so much lighter, I feel happier, more grateful and have started new habits that honestly have taken off for me. The app is not as expensive as I assumed, and it honestly has been worth it. I'm only a few weeks in but so far I've always started 3 new habits that have been coming easier to me at a natural pace. I don't feel overwhelmed, but empowered with this app regimen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Re-starting using this app seven years on from my original review below. I love the evolution of Fabulous, they have stayed up to date and just keep improving things. Very impressed. Latest psych/occupational therapy research driven. Attractive, easy to use, fun. Keeps popping up new things to keep you interested over the weeks - and to ease you in to all the new stuff you have to take on. I use it everyday and it helps keep me on track. Double thumbs up!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me 3 weeks after canceled free 30 day free trial. Waste of time and scammy vibes. Watch your transactions EDIT: I've jut read several other Complaints from 1 star users that despite canceling the app during 30 day free trial, THEY WERE ALL STILL CHARGED. SCAM This app has been reported"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No deja probarlo sin poner una tarjeta de cr√©dito antes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't felt myself lately and this app has helped tremendously. From the little stories to each task I get done, I feel great and no longer stressed about getting everything done. As long as you make time to check it, it will do it's job. It's just like reading your Bible or watching TV everyday at the same time. Builds great habits and let's you know when your about to take on too much. Hands down the best $40 per year I have ever spent!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy this app very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app, I like how it is setup and how it help you to be more positive about your routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it . Motivational uplifting very real and positive feedback"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged a yearly price for a 7 day free trial (I downloaded the app less then an hour ago). I have canceled my subscription immediately upon the realisation and I want my money back immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I liked the app when I had it. Then I swapped from Samsung to an iPhone and it won't allow me to access my account and is acting like I'm a new user when I have a subscription. Irritated I wasted $40!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I really was looking forward to using this app as my morning routine, but of course they have to make a subscription for most of the apps features. I understand there has to be a way to make money, but I'm pretty disappointed üòï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm loving it. Only been using it for a couple of days now. The free version. Kinda sucks that it's not all free or a little cheaper. But I will eventually get the paid version. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would like to ask my future self, how did u get the money to buy this ? Well I don't have any money, so I guess I will just uninstall this app and use some old people advices for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have only used this a couple of days but have enjoyed it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the visuals and overall feel of the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This might actually be something that works im gonna stick eith it and hopefully finally im gonna see some changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What is really important about this app that is based on science and for everyone who read atomic habits or interested in habits he knows that habits is as simple the same as complicated it is and this app really helpful so that's a 5 full start for the easy using"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Mad! I cant even look at what the app offers. It has a free 7 day trial I put in all of my info and it kept asking me to link things and ""verify"" info which started to seem sketchy. Then it says the trial is free but I had to pay $1.00 anyway which is BS. I had to sign up and link an account. When i tried to link my google account it wanted all my personal info to sign in. I got weird notifications. Finally google said not to link my account because it's untrusted. I paid $1 and got zero trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Started using recently. I find it very helpful. It promises to be a great blessing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this really the best productivety and routine app i have ever used it really helped me with building habits and making my own routineüò≠üíñüíñüíñ thank you fabulous you helped me a lotü´Çüíñüíñ"

I really do feel better and look forward to it daily. Sometimes I don't get everything done through the day while working full-time but that is OK."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just started"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"What's the point of answering many personal questions and then pay in a week? before getting to explore the app features or how helpful it is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app that I ever used This app makes Me more productive Helps me plan my day and my time This app changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring. Not pricy. I like the direction it takes one in. More info later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me have a good morning and helps my morning be more Organized"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I still have trouble commeting but i think i need alarms or something but all of all it's a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only on day one, but so far, I feel like it will help me accomplish the overall healthy lifestyle I am trying to achieve and maintain."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, try it if you want to move forward on your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much üëåüèªüôèüèªüçÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a life changer. I have adopted some really great habits that have been incredibly powerful. My ability to keep a positive mindset even under trying times has become amazing. If I could give this app a 10, I would."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful application with achieving your target habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Reinforces habits in a way that makes you feel fulfilled; which is exactly what I was looking for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible, but I wish the clocks wouldn't reset at 12 am, I'm awake usually between 10am and 2am but by the time I'm doing my nightly routine, the challenges for the day have reset. I wish I could pick when my days start and end"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love!!! Please can we get more yoga options xxx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't wait for another task. It makes my day chalenge.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It took some time to get a chance to my schedule. Being a homeschool mom before children It's very hard to get time for myself but this app help me set a goal to look forward to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great team put an effort in perfecting this app. Not your typical habit tracker. It goes beyond your expectations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm liking this app so far. Helps me get organized and helps keep me on track without being too pushy. Good app, could use some refining on the graphics for the congratulations. Sometimes they're just squares instead of the intended graphic. That said, this app is honestly wonderful. The more I use it the more useful it reveals itself to be. Keep up the good work! Don't stop working on this app, company! It's worthwhile for people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps build lasting habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app that gives good motivation and tips for making each day better!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As soon as the introduction was done, and I had given my credit card details, it immediately stopped working and now closes itself within seconds whenever I try to reopen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app because it motivate you a lot to make a good change in your life, and is so refreshing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I'm only a little in. But even then life had alr been better!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tha best to be tha best, I swear I love this app if you don't have money for the premium watch the ad for daily renewal access to premium that's the smartest thing because rn my life is a mess and I can't afford but yall are helping me be the best person I can be for Lil to no cost ‚ù§Ô∏è I love yall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Must Pay to use App. You get a week free trial. If you are looking for a free app this is not for you and save your time downloading. Not one of those you get basic free use and extras are premium paid. It's only pay to use minus the 7 day trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a paid app. It's your normal phone reminder app for the unpaid users."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a incredible app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is the app that really helped me have habits that changed my lifestyle. Although ads can sometimes be annoying, I understand that they are needed to support the creators of Fabulous. This is the best free app for habit-building, and it also has many guides if you're lost on where to start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seams good but not much for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You can't see the app without paying for it...that should tell you it's not worth it. Way overpriced! You can request a refund, but they won't approve, and they sneak the subscription into the terms and conditions. $40 for an app that tells you what you already know?? It's completely insane. Save yourself the trouble and set a reminder to drink water üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Please add app and tiles for watches"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm rating this app so they stop asking me to rate it. It only gets 2 stars because I hate apps that nag all the time to be rated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's alright"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very functional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great value! Has helped me get rid of my bad habits and strengthen the good ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A very good app to help you gain new habits. It's a great start to motivate you and your future goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Helpful if you need assistance with drinking water and remembering to breathe air. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Otherwise, it's just an overly complicated reminder app that lacks a lot of other necessary organizational features. A total waste of space to have on your phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Email required, subscription only. (‚ïØ¬∞ ‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a trap! I activated the 7-day trial and no button to cancel shows up, no way to contact customer service but the bot and creating a ticket on your own states the captcha failed, you have to try again and again. When it's sent you automatically receive an email with the same info the bot sent before. Don't fall for it. Don't buy it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best habit building app i have ever used .. and it keeps you motivated üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's really frustrating how expensive these apps are"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After downloading the application, I spent a lot of time answering a large number of questions. And only then they showed me that the application is paid! This is disrespectful to me as a customer! I'm deleting the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, flexible and actually works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me start my day, and give me helpful advice on what to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful and very helpful üëèüèº I ü§çü§çü§ç honestly wish I had found this years ago!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works, if you work it. So glad I have this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to start the day ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect app. If u want to change yourself u must use this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Tbh it's a good app but the problem here is we have to pay for most of the things, it gets boring as we can't get anything else added In our routine or learn about some new stuff from this as most of the things are locked. Before making this pay and get stuff you should have thought about kids who can't pay. Please take this into consideration."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cost too much Im broke and everything that actually would help is behind a paywall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Customer service is garbage, even if you're paying for premium, so I stopped paying. The free version has limitless pop-up ads, which have a link to ""watch one ad to get premium for the day"", but that link almost never works. Every link to pay for premium on that same pop-up, however, works flawlessly every time. The free version is so limited, it causes more stress than help. Sad because this app was so good years ago, and it just keeps going downhill. Now using Finch and Balance more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If they were as busy helping me build good habits, as they are trying to cross sell me their other apps, this would be an amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exeptionally good habit tracker"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Every good stuff having its price but still a great app !!! Loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Its all good in heart, but i cant add things to my sceduale without a pop-up to 'try 7 days free' i dont want to do that. If there was a different version where it wasnt free trials or having to add freinds and family, then i would use it. But making people pay to use and app when they could just, write it down or ask someone to remind them for free isnt fun. I uninstalled your app because it is unuseful and i feel others should also uninstall. If youe woulf change your app, i might reconsider.‚òπ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cute and all, but I expect to be able to create routines on a routine planner app. Two habits per routine isn't useful. I understand that the free version of an app will be limited, but even the free version should function on it's own. If you need to pay for the app to work as intended, it should simply be a paid app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app. It teaches you how to make good habits and take care of yourself. This is perfect for anyone wanting to stay healthy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been really useful so far, I used it before a few years ago but didn't follow it properly, but this time I have followed the routines and suggestions more closely and it has helped, it claims to help you feel more organised and better in 15 days, but I'm 3 days in and it's I've already improved my organisational skills, if not my energy levels. I think with prolonged use this can actually change your life for the better. I'm paying a few pounds a month for it so I'm pretty pleased."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Couple of days in and it really is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'll was very good it changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good way of reminding you to look after yourself, I have adhd and it has helped level out an actual routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have a problem drinking water. It makes me feel sick and I think it tastes gross. So I am glad I have something to remind me to drink water in the morning because I won't. And it's nice to have a reminder to tidy up before going to sleep. Clears the mind. Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A powerful app that can help us get our head out phones and computers and get our brains thinking again. Start a good thing in your life and at the end of the day, feel fabulous. üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me change myself. It's not easy, and I'm struggling, but they never promised it would be easy. They gave me a chance, told me to take my time, and no matter how long it took, I was making progress. My struggle seems frustrating, but it's progress, and I'm proud of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My therapist recommended this one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app feels hella condescending and grandiose. Feels like reading a horoscope that's obviously written to apply to anyone and yet still doesn't match you at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its the best self development app i have ever seen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So easy to use! It reminds me to follow through, even when I've forgotten, so I have the opportunity to succeed. Great for absent-mindedness (adhd)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too expensive, no option for monthly subscription. Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app fantastic choices of goals to pursue, the only thing it doesn't have is a quit video games path but that is literally the only thing, we'll worth the money..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got the ap cause the ad featured a wake up checklist. As far as I can tell that is not a function the ap even includes... So to me it's false advertising and I don't want to waste anymore time to see if the ap provides a different useful purpose."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That Little Nudge We Need Sometimes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Version premium con anuncios es excelente"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encouraging and well designed approach to help create routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm trying this again and I just started. The last time I tried it I felt it was too complicated. I would really like to make some personal improvements in my life, so let's hope this works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ùë∞ùíï ùíâùíÜùíçùíëùíî ùíéùíÜ ‚ò∫"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app and breaks down into manageable steps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy app to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"forced pop ups, paywalls, generic prompts someone else chooses for you, made for a very particular demographic (morning rise and grind influencer types)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Finally an app that acknowledges setbacks and failures as well as progress. Most life coaching apps act as though success is the only way to go and the only thing we can do is go up, but sometimes there are setbacks and acknowledging them made things so much easier for me. Definitely would recommend for people dealing with anxiety, depression or any day to day difficulties with emotions. Also helps keep in check your physical health, which is just as important! In love with this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me stay focused and motivated. I am really enjoying it so far!! Worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just starting the app and I like how it's formatted to bring me rest and grace for myself in my habits and goals. I'll report back if my opinion changes but I'm liking it. (PS I have premium)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I Loved everything in this app! I have nothing more to say! Fantastic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ABSOLUTE SCAM. Got ""90-day free trial"" and they charged me $94 because of a button that let's you think you're just looking. No confirmation option. No email confirmation, just a $94.00 charge on my credit card. Can't contact them, still waiting for reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I didn't wanna get free trial bc when it ends it will buy it and I don't want that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its perfect but my family is the one destroying my morning routine so i tend to be inconsistent in doing it, by inconsistent i mean the time i do these things are not the same as the last time i did it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app easy to use and customisable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really Not for my kind of neurospicyness ...üòÖ To active you account and even see what the app has to offer it make you ""sign "" a contract that seem well intentioned but I sent my anxiety in to a spiral and I was just unable to continue as it terrified me to commit to something so strongly... Probably not a app for my kind of neurodivergent as there is no way no continue with out 100% commitment... Would greatly recommend the developers look in to how they can make this less confidential üòÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the small, guided steps it uses to build toward success and also the research-based principles that underlie the processes it uses."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me get more organized ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Don't call it a daily routine planner if it can't plan my daily routine. Uninstalled after 10 minutes, I got 30 screens trying to upsell me on a product I hadn't even tried yet & the only thing I was able to do was set up a drink water task... which I already do every morning. Very frustrating & slow. I guess it's good if all you want to do in the first week is learn to drink water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't remember using this app in 2020, but apparently I did and gave it 4 stars...I started using this app this week, and so far it is helping to hold myself accountable for my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So I like the app I think it's great I do have a problem with the habits what's the point of having that much when I can only add 2 and pay for premium ...I have deleted the app since then"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great format. Much better than the other habit apps I've tried."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth every penny!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love the app it really makes me push myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive and friendly app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app for those who want to start new good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Inspiring! Nice design. Reminiscent of the PS game ""Journey"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Now all you need is yourself to actually really use it daily for change to happen. Fantastic graphics, content is awesome and it really makes me feel good. I wish I came across this long ago."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A pleasant app overall. Please remove the ""rate us"" pop-up after the user rates it. Cheers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've used this app off and on since 2016. I recently came back after a few years away and am pleasantly surprised at all the changes. I'm loving the app and am already feeling better and more positive and energetic after 2 simple habits that seem like no brainers but they've made a big difference. Glad I came back and love the new changes! Can't wait to see where the journey takes me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a trial, cancelled two days later, but was still charged $42.99. Scam!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had chosen 7 day free trial. I had set up the auto payment for the same. They have deducted money from my account. Since I purchased it and unsuscribed it with in a hour. I wanted to know how much time it will take for the money to reflect back. Also, the reason for unsubscription that it is too confusing. It is not user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"You get 7 days trial but your friends 30. In addition , I got lost with all tasks and things to listen to. The main screen feels like a mess."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very engaging app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a fraud app. App is designed to not allow exit minimize or back. Forces you to pay. Doesn't allow logging out. doesn't let you unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helped me turn my every tasks into rituals of self love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is delightful love the illustrations and stories"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic, it really helped me turn my life around, and, when things fall apart, I can restart it and build up all over again!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing experience ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, with the free trial, I have learned how to start my day with a healthy morning routine (which is still being established) and have spent more time than I would like listening to and reading motivational stuff. I'm hoping once I get into better routines, the app won't be so much of a time suck. I wish the free trial was longer than 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Woow this app is gorgeous ü§óü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app isnt updated to work with mewer operating systems. It freezes my screen and sometimes i habe to restart it just to be able to use my phone. Unfortunate waste of my money and time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just started. Like it so far. Still waiting to decide if it is worth the money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having ADHD, I don't really develop habits, but routines are very helpful. Fabulous does a good job of reminding me, giving little dopamine boosts, and simple suggestions to help build toward healthy routine. My ADHD also tends to make me feel either daunted or I get excited and plan a 10-item checklist that I'm never gonna stick to. I haven't passed the 3 week mark yet (that will be the true test), but thus far, it's been well worth the money. Very well thought out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love having an app that encourages me to do better by my body!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Years ago, this was my go-to app. This used to be a good app, but they kept trying to make it perfect, taking away things that we liked. Now there are more pop ups and ever, and you only get one week for free. It's not really worth putting your life goals into this app because when you realize how much you have to pay, you will have put all this information in this app for nothing. Go elsewhere!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive encouragement and small steps add up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I was curious to give this a try but it seemingly set an alarm in spite of me asking it not to, and in spite of me looking through settings to try ensure it didn't send alerts. I assume so in retrospect, as I noticed the alarm on my status bar after installing and became anxious trying to find the cause. My suspicion was confirmed when the symbol vanished when I hit uninstall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't give them your email."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its helping me a lot. Just give it a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice really helps me keep track of things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A fantastic daily planner to help you focus on what really matters"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Like daily/nightly coaching (not reminder time on latter). Habit routines good. Promotes build habits slow on journey, then freq tries sidetrack to challenges, etc - distracting & incohesive. Insists on share w family/friends triggering if all alone- can't copy/paste for myself. Upsell apps, many popups to gift & say I'm premium is really awful when paid app & it's expensive! Why?!! Ongoing free version mentioned in reviews but charge after 7 days/0 use- no habit reminders. Trial is money grab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is truly a great way to help yourself it does cost money to get the full experience, but I say it's worth every penny, and it really isn't that much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful concept. Simply life changing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had to pay for a yr of premium just to see how it worked. Regret it. Developers seem to comment only on good comments and not any about lack of refunds or accident payments. Maybe that's the plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an inspiring and motivating app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I enjoy a lot of things about the app, especially the soothing ""coaching"" messages. I think that this is really just overall not the app for me though because the ""goals"" that are being set are things that I already do in my daily routine. I wish there was an option for people who are already a bit further along in their wellness journey. I would continue using the app if that were a possibility. If someone is a complete beginner on their wellness journey then this is a great way to start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"cool concept i love the idea of starting small."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it...I like it alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm was sooo happy when I got this but when I was making my list for the morning it ONLY allowed me to have two things on my list. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, IT'S SAYING PICK THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOU IMPROVE, BUT YOUR MAKING YOU LIST YOU CAN ONLY PICK, AND WHEN YOU HAVE YOU TWO AND YOU PRESS ANOTHER THING IS SAYS YOU HAVE TO BUY PREMIUM SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE THINGS ON YOUR LIST!!! But it's a really nice app if you have PREMIUM. Oh and what if you don't have enough money to get premium? FIX IT!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I already have a routine, but I am so disorganize. This all helps me map ou my routines, remind me of the goal and keep me in track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfect ü•∞ exactly what I need!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I am enjoying it. I am trying to live life more structured and this helps alot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app is helping me make small positive changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything is locked, I can't afford to to open it, I found it great but only for 1 week.. I'm having a hard time in life and I needed this but.. I can't afford it.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Difficult to cancel and they will not prorate your charge if you fail to actually complete the cancellation. Also the subscription does not show in Google Play."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Putting the things I know will help me feel & function better into Morning & Evening Routines is so helpful. Your list of suggested habits helped me identify items I may not have thought of. Recently, I had a stressful life event change/ surprise, which can lower my mood & motivation, this app is helping me to be action forward, & do good self-care- which improves my mood. Thank you for such a great tool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I was skeptical, but I gave it a try, and I'm so glad I did! I've already made some small but very real changes in my life... I still can't believe it, but now I start every day with my morning ritual and feel so much healthier and happier with myself. The constant support and motivation the Fabulous team provides on a daily basis is wonderful. I feel like I'm on a steady, relentless path to improving my life. Update: So, I was able to keep at it for about 3-4 months before I gave up... üòÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used Fabulous for over 2 years. It is the best mental health aid, I have ever seen!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app has been really helpful to me, in order to lear how to break down goals into tiny steps, and the coachings have interesting points of view including quotes of books and artists, to make easy to consider other perspectives about the issues of each day, and explaining with science and specific actions how to adopt better behaviors for my health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool for gradually building good habits into your daily life. It even tells you when you've added too many new challenges/tasks at once to prevent you from burning out and eventually quitting... something I know I'm guilty of. Highly recommend for anyone feeling disorganized or unmotivated. Pleasant sounds and animations make it a rewarding experience just to open the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's really goodüòçüòçüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulous deceptive predators! Avoid using the fabulous app at all cost! I signed up for the trial, then paid the $39.99 premium cost last year (June 2022). I never received any emails or other communication confirming the subscription. The subscription did not show up in the Google play store (android user) I deleted the app since I wasn't using it last year and a year later I was charged AGAIN. After emailing repeatedly with their company they refuse to refund the charge because ""its in thei"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great immersive app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app by far. It rejuvenates my spirits everytime.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've cancelled my subscription and I've been receiving constant attempts to charge my card. Your CSR is also unresponsive. Pleasr resolve this issue asap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. Answer some questions then get sent to a payment page."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Will not let you use the app until it receives contact information. Boo. üëéüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this! This app has made me smile many times I'm 3-4 days in and I already love it!!üíô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You get out of it what you put in. It all may feel super cheesy, or super hard or even super easy... but if you give it a genuine try and follow the steps... Maybe you'll find it helps you like it's helping me. Way cheaper and more effective than behavioral therapy in my opinion!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I do not want to be fingerprinted to use this app which it required for a bs reason. Uninstaller it as soon as I got to that requirement. Dangerous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Meh. It asked me some questions about goals and I felt excited and then had me hold my finger print down to ""sign a contract"" of goals it had auto-generated saying that this method is proven to help but they were not actual goals of mine. ""I will remember I will not live forever and to not let fear and irritation stop me"" - those aren't things I am working on, lol. And then it informed me of the cost of the service. No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is so amazing and life changing for me. I highly recommend it to others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires mail, connection,..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This scared the absolute heck out of me when first I opened the app, it played a VERY loud tune that only got louder. Had a nice little panic attack over that. üò£ Got hit with paywalls 6 times in 10 minutes, each time I had to exit out of 2 or 3 different ones. Honestly the app looked really promising and premium price was decent. I just couldn't even navigate the app long enough post tutorial to figure out if I wanted to do the one week free trial without paywalls everytime I tapped something."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps me keep track of daily goals and even health concerns. I like the dail coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç great üò∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Promotes things that do not agree with my religion. (Yoga)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A digital life coach, which really helps to improve your life. Start small. Really, that 1 drink of water a day is important to just start from scratch and declutter your life. Task by task you will get there and achieve your goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful reninders, valuable inspiring short coaching lessons based on human insights about motivations & learning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have to lower my rating. The app was nice enough for reminding me to drink water and take my medications. I enjoyed the little encouragement and community. However, it automatically added a breakfast routine that doesn't align with my actual routine. Thankfully, I could remove it from my routine, but I don't enjoy new routines being added when it's not what I downloaded the app for. If I wanted a routine to remind me to eat, I would've added it to my routine myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just started with this app but I'm really loving it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy it but costs alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the apps where I've actually been able to maintain the goals for more than just a few weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Takes time to get used to but its d best habit app I've used. Amazing daily coaching"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't figure out how to cancel the trial. The email said that I would be billed after the trial ends, yet after going to the website, it says that it is free of charge and doesn't have the option to cancel. I'm very nervous as to whether I'll be forced to fork over money I don't have for an app I will not use again. Will deleting my account prevent any possible charges? This is ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The illustrations looks very sweet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Well good but need premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice companion app to guide you through the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and still exploring the possibilities it can open"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"i used to use this some years ago and i liked it but now i cant even put more than 2 habits and I have to pay for it.. no thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app.sounds amazing however, I am not sure I can access everything because I don't seem to be able to see the advertised screen. Maybe once the trial is over I will access everything but on the little I can access its not really value for money for me but I love the concept and hope others can see the full value when they have the full experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app and seeing the changes already."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this definitely an amazing app it helps you see your self and your goals clear even its expensive tho its all worth it but i recommend to add more languages so other more people can explore it cause they'll need it so much and i hope if you allow monthly paying it'll be easyer to pay it monthly and finally thank you so much for such a great app üôèüíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. You get motivated and can put your plans in order."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is like a personified personal reminder who prompts you in gentle guidance. Kinda cool, huh?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I do not give the 5 stars because I think that all habits can be editable... For example, for me to get to a next level of habits, I Have to ""have breakfast""... I do not take brakefast because I do OMAD intermittent fasting, so it does not work that ""mandatory habit"" for me. The rest works really good. I have the premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Food jurnaling app advertisment is little annoying. A dark theme would be a useful addition."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It keeps on telling me 15 times in a single morning to drink a glass of water even after the task is already done. To morning meditation audio text was very rushed like in 10 seconds you should breath, take in your surroundings, feel your emotions, close your eyes. App is way to aggressiv"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Oh I love it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app as its help build more of my daily routine and keep my mental health in check. Theirs no adds in here and it does what it says it does"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Within five minutes I knew it wouldn't be a good fit for me. Yes, I have low energy and low motivation, but the fact that I'm waiting to go into labor probably is a good explanation for that, plus there's the fact that on any given day I don't know what my life will look like. It felt too rigid and overwhelming for my needs. That, and the app seems REALLY aggressive about trying to get people to pay for a subscription when first time use you don't even know if you'd like it or not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I want to be able to look back at my progree"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I will keep editing my review if possible, but so far - this is soo good. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great concept, but pretty much unusable.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is pretty incredible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. I like that I'm not able to access tomorrow's tasks until then. I have a tendency to dive into things and overwhelm myself by trying to do it all right away. I think some sort of messenger or chatroom feature would be very beneficial. I've never liked posting on forum-style boards. I don't know why but it just makes me uncomfortable. But being able to talk to, and friend, other people in a real time setting would be good for finding like minded people to help each other out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very goooooooooooood"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A bit expensive but well worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A lot of features that used to be free with the app seem to now be pay to use. I can no longer add habits, even if I remove and try to replace one I already had. As someone that needs minute to minute scheduling, this app no longer works for me. Was a great app before this though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying this app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish there could be a different routine for week days and weekends, or even better for specific days since I work shifts but other that that it is great to help me get my adhd in check"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Get ready to make new habit for your future"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best...... Thank you so much üåπ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am now downloading it but I see some feedback on the app now that I gave it only 1 star ‚≠ê soo I don't even play it now but saw the photo s so I think it would be best now after seeing the feedback I don't think so much for on no feedback there is best or great like ok lets see how it is after downloading it I will see and then I will also give again a feedback mostly this mobile is not mine its my grandmother so I will not have it all the time lets see how it is please try to make it better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find how well it works very interesting. I'm really enjoying the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled this app in June, it is now August and I am still being charged $39.99 once a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fabulous app..!!! Make you stick to your habit, achive goals, nourish your inner being."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Hmmm, the upselling and messaging links to my network turned me off immediately. It's probably got the bones of a useful tool, if I could get past that. I understand businesses need to make money, but let me try it for more than 5 minutes before upselling and force spreading the message to my network. Then, it looks like unsubscribing isn't straight forward either. Tricky."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lots of poetic and scientific inspiration, this app helps me reign in my habits and make them healthy for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am enjoying the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Spiritual"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app for helping me build new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice just too many ads for People Who havent purchased the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved this app so much. It is helping me in changing my habits and routines to became a best of myself..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is actually very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Big potential but major letdown without paying - can't do even very basic stuff like add more than 2 tasks/habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I did upgrade for more features, but at the yearly price point, it is worth it. I like how it encourages building routines in baby steps so that you are not overwhelmed. The daily coaching is inspirational. While I have not quite got the hang of doing the routines EVERY day, the app doesn't guilt you, instead just encourages you more. I like it a lot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ok, at first I thought this app would help me, until I realized you needed to PAY for it, seriously? PAYING just to be more PRODUCTIVE? If you don't like spending money on apps then I do not recommend this one. This is just my opinion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"saw the ads and seems good. However, it turns out I need to Paid for the app after doing a FIVE mins survey.... Should write about its Not Free at the description"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"1 week in and loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Overall good app. However, the difference between the monthly and annual price is kind of absurd."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Every time I decide to work on myself in some way, I create a huge routine that is almost impossible to follow, and then get disappointed at myself for not completing it. I love this app because it gives you tiny steps towards your goal that slowly build up. It feels snail pace at first but it is so worth it in the end."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"everything about money n all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A growing tool for a better you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üóø"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"In April of 2021, I downloaded the free trial of the Fabulous app. I missed the cutoff date and got charged that first year, that's my bad. I canceled the app through Google Play on April 29, 2021. Yet for some reason, this app has continued to charge me for the past two years directly through my Paypal account. I contacted them, and they said they have no account for me. So it seems this company swiped my info from Google Play and is charging me for an app I canceled and have no contract with."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I do not recommend this app. They charged my card for two months even though I cancelled my subscription before the free trial ended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this is the great way to increasing productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Fabulous app lived up to it's name. It is helping me develop the skills and routines to meet my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im only four days into my journey but I can already Tell that this App is doing it right. At least for me who has tried many approaches and apps but never quite connected with them. It starts of with a nice pacing to implement healthy routines in small incremental steps, without giving you to much to ask of yourself. Meanwhile you get the freedom to connect with the app internal network and get inspired by the people and coaches as well as copy routines (though I haven't quite figured that out)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nicely done. Start slow, build strong habits, celebrate... I really liked the first week. I'm wondering what ""premium"" is about, there is a trial, I guess we'll take the time to discover. Just one thing, I really liked the screenshots on the app description, but I can't find a way to make my home screen look like theirs... Any clue ? Edit : 2 weeks later, I had to change my phone, and there is no history backup. The streak is gone, this is a real setback, motivation-wise."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Opened the app and a horrendous high pitched noise made me have a really bad time. I'm struggling to put words together. Edit: Now that I feel better, I want to make sure people reading this with hypersensitivity to audio and visual stimuli DO NOT INSTALL this app, or they'll have an awful time like I did earlier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything is paidü•≤"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It comes in handy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helps me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A small step but make the great impact"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app on and off for years and if it wasn't for my adhd I would've been on the entire time. I absolutely love it, I recommend it and I will continue to come back every time I fall off and they're part of the reason I don't feel bad about that and I just know that it's a part of the journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very enjoyable and helpful! Would recommend, and the subscription is EXTREMELY cheap!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had no problems with this app. I don't pay for the premium, but I still enjoy it. The positivity posted on the app and encouragement from others is great! I like that it makes challenges for you to complete. I think the small goals is a good start for healthy habits. I personally think challenges are fun like games, so I think this would be good for building up others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Somewhat customizable. Enjoying the encouragement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires you to sign up for no particular reason and all just to farm emails. Why do I need to sign up for something I never plan to use online I have no idea but I hate this digital trend of companies trying to constantly monitor us. 1 star was unfortunately the lowest I can rate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"midia"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app, but now it doesn't let me add more than 2 habits to a routine unless I subscribe. Before that it was 3, and before that it was unlimited. I don't see the point of it if you can't add all the habits you want to implement in your routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful. As a new college student,my schedule is all over the place and I've lost motivation and confidence. This app is helping me get it back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using this App for less than a month and I am already seeing and feeling a huge difference. It is amazing what I as a person am getting out of this App."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app Cool experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It seems to be a great little app to remind you to do the simple things, make them a habit, make them a habit and then move to bigger things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Useful, but lots of self promotions and prompts to review. Hoping it will actually stop prompting me if I put in a review"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy it. It is fun and helps keep me moving in a positive direction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Bombarded by ""but premium"" notices asks ""are you sure"" EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE APP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app forever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"To simply put it: it's one of the best apps I've used ever. It has helped me increase my spirituality, mental health, physical health and happiness. So grateful to the Fabulous team and wish the best for y'all :)üíû‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great but everything is premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es una buena app muy completa, realmemte me ayuda a implementar nuevos habitos y hasta ahora no he tenido ningun problema"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible app! I got the first month free (needed credit card info first of course) and it took foreveeerrr for the app to even process that. I had to confirm like 5 different buttons to activate. And then, they still have ads for another app permanently on the home screen in the premium version ü§¶ and to top it all off... The app is not even worth it. It's literally stuff you can set up on your Google calendar. All it is are reminders to drink water, breathe, be grateful... Whyyy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Non binary? That is an insult to God's creation. They're only two genders: male and female."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the coach and the letters and the story and the way it knows what's wrong with me üò≠üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love you Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good, daily motivational exercises are great. It helps to teach you that you might faulter but even that can be a positive thing I have failed a couple of times but I tried again. A couple of the habits never left me which is a good sign"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the subscription before they where to charge me, but they still charged me! please give me my refund and I'll change my review to what I really think about the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I used to have fabulous a couple of years ago, and it's grown really well, but it's also gotten a lot worse. Before, the layout was much better, and it was much more accessible, but now they have made a lot more features only accessible with the premium app which not all people have the money for, and they have an insane amount of popup ads for premium now. I also recently got a new phone and logged into my account, and all of my progress was gone, which was incredibly frustrating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app to help make smart goals and CBT style changing for success driven lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the general way this app works and enjoy the interface but it is nearly unusable if you don't pay for it. It asks constantly to watch an ad even though it says you only have to watch one a day. I ended up deleting my account and uninstalling it because I couldn't deal with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, i really like it üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Calming, keeps you focused, accountability to yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just what I wanted! Wonder if I could add an option to customise a challenge and invite family and friends. ( Like 75 hard challenge). Great App though!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and love the bright colours and themes in the app. Very encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The UI, the colour and engagement of this app deserves a five star rating. But so far I'm using the unpaid version which has a very sluggish pace and I can't pass my judgement how the paid version going to work."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and simple"

You can only choose from a specific list of habits to keep track off, to add your own, pay up. It just shoves its premium version Down your throat and makes it an obnoxious experience for those who don't want to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an intentional app, with all the available resources needed to help you achieve your desired results. You just need to put in the work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why they need fingerprints!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"layout is a little confusing so do some exploring around the app, other than that its super motivating and calming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"ive tried the app before but thought i should try it again you shouldnt have to fight a productivity app to get it to work i just wanna organise myself, not have 100000 popups and ""tips"" and ads and have the app not really do what i want just give me the damn features jfc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's simply nice... Idk whether it'll make some changes in me, still i fall in love with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§I love this app.Helped me a lot during my self improving journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great graphics and storyline. Very helpful so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super duper helpful, one of a kind. Found daily Motivation instantaneously. Thank you Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am walking with Fabulous, my growth path."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app for healing from abuse, finding self worth, and self care in general"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The most dreadfully idiotic app I've ever seen..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App really does help you achieve consistency in healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful experience..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've been trying to unsubscribe and they make it very difficult!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This one was not for me. You get a free week to try it but your friends get a free month if you convince them to dry it. It gives you baby steps to a goal that somebody else has set, starting with ""drink water in the morning."" Complete that and you get ""healthy breakfast."" There's a motivational commentary and I can see how for some people it would be good. I just really didn't find it interactive enough and honestly I don't love the interface."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A nice way to work on building good habbits. Not sure if it will stick long term, but it seems better than trying to do it all on your own."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fabulous is helpful but it isnt perfect. I like how my daily habits are organised into morning, daytime and evening rituals. I also like that they start challenges small and this encourages you to do more over time. The downside is that now its got too much ""stuff"" on it... its ruined it a bit. App suggestions, letters, challenges, notifications, all sorts of noise that I find overwhelming and unhelpful. Its gotten worse over time, when i used the app about 5 years ago it didnt have as many."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, the app is awesome and keeps me accountable. I will give a future review as I do more of the prompts. 5 üåü so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Everything is good but it is not half free. We have to pay for this whatever we enter. That is only problem but it's working too good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is extremely helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can only add two things to a routine without paying $40... What?! That's not a routine! That's ridiculous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"What the hell, just download this and it's been 10 minutes still asking questions and setup. Just let me get to the app, I can figure bish setup later or learn how to use app later"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, no Ads, actual information you can use and apply in your daily life compared to tons of the other apps out there. Not too invasive as well but good at reminding you of your tasks, 1 week in and my mood has changed significantly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!! It helps changing me to a new me Thanks to this app I'm confident about myself.... Advisable to download..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Net for kontrol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It took me a few tries but I finally got a really good streak in and stopped worrying about missing an item or two on my checklist. Worth the effort, great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Probably the only thing thats working for me in terms of changing bad habits to good ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun and motivating if you do it. The first few days feel silly honestly but I can see where it's going and I'm going to continue to give it a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. There are a few billing issues. All good now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been keeping me consistent with my new habits. Love the layout, the great advice, the community, and most of all, the affordability of the app. 10 out of ten would recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this! Helping me be more organized n routines without feeling over whelmed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for anyone with struggles or mental health issues... I love it, it's already helped me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great if you pay, if not.... Stop asking me to rate your app ffs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I already cannot cancel it or uninstall it during the trial period. I tried to see if it would let me cancel it if I wanted to and it would not. If you uninstall the app it says this does not cancel the app. So how do you cancel the free trial if it doesn't suit you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"New user, so far so good, still on the free trial period. Will update at the end"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and I can possibly get use to it and create good habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great at motivation and fun! Easy to use daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its all about finding the right app for you that you can resonate with, as they say here, rather than guide, do a little more and help you get there with the guidance. As humans, we are happy to spend hundreds of hard earned pounds/dollars & euros, on our car and home insurance, but what about you. Every app like this has a cost, but its not too much for the incredible benefit of provides, ready for the NEW you. This app is perfect and in a way that anyone will feel inclusive & fully guided!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've had. Increased my productivity tremendously."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for 6 days now and I really enjoy it. The gental reminders and inspirational readings help with sticking to it because they keep me interested and active in the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried it and it seemed good, but for a free self improvement app, they were charging everything. Like, premium just so I can add a 3rd goal on my morning routine? Absolutely ridiculous bro. Don't waste your time here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"TO TRY THE APP, I'm railroaded to purchase the ""discounted subscription"" or be blocked for a year. I canceled/uninstalled. The intro is loaded with political garbage, and I don't care which political party or social influence you have. No, thank you. I doubt this is for me. It has some potentially encouraging habits, and maybe it is worth the cost. If this is supposed to work for children, they would benefit from this infantile art. Not for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Improve your life style using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An app that motivates me to improve."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using the app for 3 days. I refuse to pay the yearly membership other than that I find this app a great help in my daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app I love tracking my progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not night shift friendly. I appreciate the idea of the app, but it's missing accommodations for alternative schedules. Noon is essentially my midnight. There needs to be more options for when the day begins and ends, i.e. when the cut off for previous day's goals count, before the app would work for me. Otherwise, all the coaching and notifications hit in the middle of my sleep time and the suggested evening routines cut off before I clock out of work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It was better before everything was freenow it's not"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fantastic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Working well so far in building up small habits. Easy to set up and follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Meanwhile reall help to build a few habits I was trying to build for years. Wonderful app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. Connect the user's information, then drop the $36/year fee. Garbage. The app is not free to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app help me with clean my room and plan the day so I don't have to buy a planing at the store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been on this once, and I haven't gotten my delivery yet but so far I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am bad at making realistic health goals and so I generally give up. This app starts you slow which I have found really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome& Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this advice, needed to hear everything it saids, about life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really like how it changes you . But there's a problem with downloading Challenge's.it doesn't work ü•≤"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"""This rating is a free trial, you can get the full rating by paying a 79% off fee. Or if you were lucky enough to check your emails, you could get a 100% off fee."" This is my experience with the app. Full of ""buy this, it will make you will good."" Almost like snake oil."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hello, how can i pay monthly??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth doing makes you focus"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app for self improvement. I began using this app to get out of a really rough patch of my life and so far, it has helped me get off that and focus in myself in a much more positive way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"While opening first time it was asking for some options to select but questions were not visible in xiami mi 11 mobile"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A good one for a change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This has been really helpful but every minute I get a notification to buy premium. I thought the app was broken so I wasn't going to rate it that high but then I realised that you can't do more than 1 challenge at a time so a warning for anyone who is going to get this, don't do more than 1 challenge at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It offers a lot of resources and guidance to master the fundamentals before getting to the bigger concerns."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not happy with being manipulated into buying memberships by using my own health against me, saying my future me would benefit more like your demographic doesn't include disabled people who can't afford your memberships"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helped me a lotüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unmemorable..and now, hella costly. I opened this alpp one time after install. Intro was too wordy for my taste. Instantly forgot i had it. And timeless story, esues & today I just lost nearly 43.79$?!?! from a subscription?!??! I didn't even know what the fabulous was?!?!? THAT forgettable. Isn't this an app to help w organization, success, ect... ?!? Wow, thats taking advantage at its greatest...and my worst. Shame On You. A refund would be the proper way to handle this complaint."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Graet app.... But can you make this free... Awesome technique in it.. Very small small goals achievement.. It's way to be a successful.. Just I complete three days drinking water achievement It's a great feeling.. Now next target is taking healthy breakfast.. That also excited"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has me focused on good habits I've never before been able to stick to. The reminders and routines work well for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Collect data and then ask money. Very bad approach and cheap mentality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This application creates too much friction to set up a single goal! And all the time is reminds you about important things like in-app purchases. Interface is incredibly inconvenient and unintuitive. I have received two fraudulent charges from them, and have to deal with chargebacks because their cancellation is not something you can rely on. Never put your payment details on their site. It is unsafe!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I got my android phone stolen, and want to use the paid apps in my new iPhone... Fabulous doesn't allow me sign-in with my premium account with the email.... a want a refund for the remaining months, or a code to add to my phone!!! Why complicate!?.. the email is the same, the person is the same... You got my money FOR A PREMIUM account, please be respectful let me use it, without make an additional payment for an active account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Everything is paid here, wasted my time in answering so many questions and registering myself. When ever I try to add more than 2 habits it asks for subscription. Couldn't find the to do list in home screen as shown in picture."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"My second time downloading the app and then deleting it again. There are waaay too many notifications it becomes so annoying! I also find there's way too much content on the app that isn't useful - letters and posts aren't that motivational after a while. Sometimes keeping things simpler is way more effective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is such a wonderful and helpful app! I love using it daily and it's REALLY helping me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I enjoy the morning and evening pep talks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"B√£o"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has helped me balence my life and my days especially with have to young children need to stay on track as i get easily distracted from tasks would be grate if there was a wiget to have on my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Neat app still navigating it but it has helped me stay more focused. You can make a morning afternoon and bedtime routine which is neat I would like to be able to schedule things at other times but I may just not know how yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very inspirational daily content. Highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. Yes, it might be expensive but I personally am fed up starting things, never finishing & I'm desperate to lose weight, become healthier, be more mindful & maintain good, positive routines. For me, personally, this app works. I love the graphics, I love the meditation sessions, how easy it is to set goals & routines. If you really want to make changes in your life, I can totally recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super great app, has a lot of function and really colorful, also very encouraging, it actually make my ADHD brain really engaging and I'm definitely having so much fun!! Tysm‚ù§Ô∏èüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it. The free features are a bit limited, but other than that, it is a very effective app. It's not too overwhelming and not too minimalistic."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app from last 2 months I guess and I can see little changes in myself and I am really focused on myself than before. Thanks üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the app it helped me a lot to improve myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a nice app, but i feel like the price of premium is a bit toooo high. Hope you guys consider the pricing for the premium for college students who are from different countries"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps to complete tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app,really helps me to start my day and to do what I'm planning,still sad that i need premium*(i won't buy the pass)to add more habbits but it still helps to have a start up plan without itüíói also love that we can interact with more people and help each other achieve our goalsüåπ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging way to live each day as you try to find or stay on your path."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is without a doubt fabulous. Its the best motivation of all time. I am extremely thankfull to all the developers for making this kind of masterpiece. It really helps and even without buying premium makes you feel you already have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Merveilleuse"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app since I was 16ish (25 now!) and everytime I commit to using it, it does me wonders. All the little habits, customisations, and little goals it sets you are so helpful and fun! The new addition of the video versions of the letters are so cool to, such a great feature! Even though I go through periods of forgetting to utilise this app (my fault, not the apps), every time I come back its so easy to navigate where I left off - even if there is a big update!! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fake app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good, but many features are locked behind a paywall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have long loved the concept of habits. This app is powerful and beautiful. I'm really enjoying it today and look forward to tomorrow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1. Nothing is more relaxing as 42 notifications per hour, even defined as ""emergency"" notifications! Set your phone to do not disturb for.. I don't know.. meditation or sleeping, ""well duck you user, we want you to see these notifications now!"" 2. And then there is the price, why does everything have to be a subscription? There is only one explanation: This app is not to help the user to get better as soon as possible, it's to bind the user and milk them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is just such a well designed app, and it genuinely makes me feel so happy when I complete tasks and achievements"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful and enlightening"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, really good. This app definitely takes more than the free week trial to shine. I'm hopeful it'll help me, small step by small step, to get out of the rut I've been in for too long."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pleasant and gentle reminders. Mindfulness. Reflection. Good stuff. üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome for building habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this. You can get the free version and not lose anything worthwhile. I do wish that the subscription for one app went across all apps, as they just released a new food related app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy it, I have been seeingprogress. I would like to get the full app when I can."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ƒ∞t's amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a little over 2 weeks at this point, and I truly love it. I'm autistic and have ADHD, so it's been a struggle for my 27 years of life to build a USEFUL routine. This has changed things for me immensely. The app was a little difficult to navigate at first, but that may just be me and the 'tism. Once I sat down and played with it for a while, I figured it out. I highly recommend this app, just be patient, let it take you thru things slowly, let your new habits build."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just WOW üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changed upset in my life. I love to things. Habits forms throughout the years and I use it. Have daily for like, 5 years. And you know, those new habits are crucial and special delication. They're, like, just there. The moment I needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've tried several habit tracking apps. This isn't it. Not to mention they make you jump through hoops to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you expect people to use something, try letting them know they have to pay for it upfront rather than making them download it and try to use it only to find out after you take their information that they then have to pay for it totally bogus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very nice it helps you in study and control your daily life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me get into a better routine and helps my physical health and mental health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing makes things that once felt like a chore to me feel like an adventure!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I've only just started, but I'm a shift worker and so wake up different times each day, and this is clearly set for those on normal shifts, so probably won't work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Premium not worth paying for. Also charged the following year without notice of an upcoming charge, which I feel is a sneaky practice for an annual item. I still have my ""thanks for joining"" email from last year which says NOTHING about subscription charges in future years, which I also feel is a sneaky practice. I requested a refund within days of the 2nd year charge, but was denied. So I am prepaid for the next 11.5 months for a service I was not satisfied with in the first year to begin with!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is great, but please make a dark mode. I'll be blind by the time I reach enlightenment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Cool app. Really hekpful for what its designed to do. I would say 4 star. But not very compatible with the latest versions of Samsung- sometimes I have to reset my whole phone, because it makes screen lag and taps unresponsive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it so far but I'm only a couple days in. The customization of what you wish to get out of it is fantastic."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super helpful way to structure my day with several ""routines"" filled with habits I want to create!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really awesome and useful, helps to create self discipline and good habits. It's also not expensive, obviously you need to pay, but it's very inexpensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish i had found yhis app during my school year, i could've used this to have a better studying experience, nevertheless its a great app for evey age"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"it's trying to charge me even though I have canceled during the trial period. it doesn't even show on my active subscription and I don't have the app installed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helping me to develop habbits I want to add on in my life ...and now I am becoming better version of myself day by day ..‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Looks good so far in GOOGLE-PLAY STORE. If you designed it to also be able to orient per my screen orientation. That will make easier to use. I use my Phone device mostly in LANDSCAPE-MODE for greater ACCESSIBILITY if text sizes can be adjusted, and have it REFLOW to stay left to right in my screen viewable area. That will (could be) a great thing, as in LANDSCAPE-MODE TEXT CAN BE A BIT LARGER FOR HANDICAPPED USER ACCESSIBILITY. (THANKS FOR LISTENING). END-OF-LINE!!!!! GODSPEED TO YOU AND YOURS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"My experience with the app has been incredible and it has helped in instilling the value of taking things one day at a time. What I've learned is that consistent small steps lead to wonderful results in the long-term. The small positive changes are always worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I lovd this app! This is one of the best health tracking app i've ever tried. although i dont like that you can only have 2 goals per routine, i get that this is a business thing but come one, only two? everything else 10/10."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful. All the self-help gurus into one. From Duke University Center for Advanced Hindsight (#Dan Ariely), and it shows. Heavyweight with thought change, in beautiful setting. Daily coaching is worth the price, times ten. I do NOT like the new comments feature. Please remove it. It does not feel like sharing. It feels like Facebook. Otherwise, double-plus-good; the only habits app I will use. It's Peppa Pig and Bluey for adults. Thank you, Fabulous team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the free trial and decided it wasn't and deleted the app for me a while ago, I am just now seeing it has been charging me $41! AND IT WAS ""50% OFF"" I am now waiting for a response from Google play for a refund. That's really annoying and upsetting that this app charged me when I did the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged for a full year after canceling my subscription. No way to get support. What the? A year later, so being ripped off. Would be really surprised if any of the reviews taking about how the visuals make up for anything aren't fake."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely loved this app. This is what I needed for soo long time. One person always tells messages through beautiful cutscenes between the habits. Good job creators and have a pat on your back. You deserve it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I took the free trial, changed my mind, and cancelled carefully before the deadline. But they charged me the $35.99 anyhow, on the deadline date. I spend over an hour trying to resolve it but their directions on that just lead you in unsolvable circles. Stay away!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Informative and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I filled the ticket, and they resolved the subscription issue. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Adding to previous, important to know there is no refund if you cancel. Signing up for personal coaching is so easy I did it without realizing, paying for 2 expensive months, tho obvious didn't use it. No refund, even of time remaining. It is pretty and fun, has some good reflections, and helpful as a reminder app, but beware of expenses and going paid before you are absolutely sure you want to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have had tremendously hard times when trying to effect positive changes in my life. So far I've lost 6lbs and quit smoking. I have also set up routines which that keeps all my tasks organized and I am alerted when it's time to complete them. This app has outstanding advice and wisdom. I have tried numerous apps but this is top notch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It is a shame that it crashes after I fill in my first answers as I think it could really help me. I tried four times and cleared cache also uninstalled and reinstalled. It didnt work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Esse √© o famoso app freemiun. √â gratuito pra baixar, mas depois voc√™ percebe que n√£o faz muito sentido continuar usando se n√£o assinar a vers√£o premium. Fico triste porque realmente parece ser um bom app, mas n√£o vou pagar 30 reais por m√™s."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrendous customer service. I cancelled the subscription within my free trial and they charged me anyways. When I reached out to customer service about it they were dismissive and unhelpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, things are definitely making more sense now. Looking forward to continuing to see where I will end up ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app for daily motivation and inspiration with a focus on health and mental well-being. Daily goals and inspirational videos give this app charm. I wish the mood tracker was more fleshed out. Its really simple and placed in the app as if it's an after thought. I don't know if this is worth the full price, but I got a deal on it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really fun and easy to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üèµüòçI would say the best app i have ever seen its free but the one thing they should improve is that every one cannnot perchase subcription so thaey should include waching ads to unlock spacific premium iteam every time over all its more than 100 percent üòçüòçüòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a great way to get your life in your hands, keeps me motivated daily! Thank you for this awesome app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying the peace and positive journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A app √© incr√≠vel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm going into this with chronic sleep issues and anxiety, but I'm seeing a glimmer of hope in just three days that I can take control of both. Recommend this app for anyone who struggles with routine and sleep"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only a week and im feeling so much happier with my life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I felt deceived when I had to answer all the questions to then ask to pay. I will make it 3 starts if you decide to mention from start that this is paid 100% app. Additionally I would pay 10-20 euros for one time buy, but this subscriptions are terrible plans. It could become decent app for the majority of people with some changes. Try not to be greedy :) I will check again the app in few months to see if it improved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app charged me $43 DURING TRIAL!! Beware!! Update: thankfully, the Play Store reimbursed me, but I still believe that the app itself is made to steal people's money during the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How to unsubsribe this app?????"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Update: The problems were fixed and I ended up paying for the premium membership. This app has been a great support in helping me develop realistic goals and healthy habits. I use the meditations EVERY night to help me sleep. Highly recommend! I really like this app at first but had to delete it because it caused a lot of ads on my phone. I would definitely redownload if this problem was fixed!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app makes good habits so much easier to do and it's helping me significantly with my self improvement journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am so tired of getting tricked by apps. That don't offer anything until after you pay. Then you sign up for the FREE trial but have a horrible time canceling and they end of taking your money no matter what you do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is designed to be interesting and makes reaching goals exciting."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very engaging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Constant badgering to get Premium. It's so bad, I'm decreasing my 5-star review from 2 years ago. I might have paid a one-time fee. Everything's a subscription these days. If your goal was to annoy me into buying Premium, it failed. I'm uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Icl but this is good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just getting started, but it is clear that a lot of thought has been put into this application and I'm looking forward to my journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"APP DELETED FOR MONTHS, NEW CHARGE ATTEMPTED IN MULTIPLE MONTHS. Terrible for ADHD. Good elements. But: (1) Aggressive upselling system, with no list of your entitlements from free offers or previous purchases. You bleed money. (2) Things disappear: navigate away from a pop-up and it's gone forever; start a 25-minute multipart exercise (e.g. ""Fresh Start"") and then stop it to deal with an interruption and you can't pick up from where you left off. (3) Display-over-other-apps hijacks your phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app that has already boosted my self confidence to do healthy things in the morning! I love how it has reminders so I don't forget to do something! It has been a wonderful app, and I can't wait to see what more it can do in a week!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everyone has to starts somewhere with personal growth definitely let fabulous help.I have bipolar and I've learned that having a routine can definitely help with manic/depressive episodes! Im horrible keeping up on routines no matter how hard I try. Fabulous makes it much easier, it's very helpful Its made me feel a lot better about myself and life even less depressed. It helps me manage my work and personal time. also helps me not beat myself up so much when I feel like I failed my routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been really good and I like the motivational texts it's lovely and it's gives me a sense of peace when I read them . Thank you very much üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app so far. It starts off building small habits so I feel like I am successful right away. The storyline is cute and the motivational messages are just what I need."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really loved this app but today I woke up and it's not working I can't choose new habits üò≠ Please fix it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gave up on installing as wanted me to continually tap finger print sensor"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love everything so far! Really does help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I downloaded it after an ad to overcome the loss of focus. But it snowed me under notifications and was centering around ""drink water"" stuff which I absolutely don't need. Also the persistence of the paid subscription is irritating, I couldn't even try it normally and they start selling it with manipulations (like as if you write a letter to yourself)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started using the app but so far really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good but only been a few days will update when I've explored mote"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just started using the app but so far it is going well. I wish you could type in your own tasks to do. Otherwise like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You keep making me watch paid ads when I paid already. Won't be paying again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disonest and confusing subscription. I cancelled my premium subscription months ago and checked multiple times. The app states that my premium subscription is inactive and gives me the option to restore my purchase. I was still charged a renewal for $39.99. I have returned to this app in the past when I have been struggling to re-establish healthy habits and routine in my life. I will use a different app in the future. UPDATE: I messaged the help center to request a refund and they refused."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried a free subscription. Didn't like it. Canceled it. Was told I canceled it too late. Didn't think I did, but okay, it happens. I'll take the hit. Haven't touched the app ever since. Today (the following year), I get hit with another $39.99. Spoke to the Better Business Bureau on how best to report it. Learned they hear this issue frequently."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I only signed up to the app 2 days ago but so far I'm loving it. At the minute I'm struggling a bit to navigate through it but I'm not technological. Can't wait to continue my journey. Back using again 3 years later, loving the app. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is simply fabulous!!!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"3rd time is a charm! Ive downloaded the app app twice before, but could never bring myself to use it.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is good! Recommend downloading it! Well it's actually good and everything is just a perfection. Well,my problem is I'm still a teen and I'm not rich I couldn't afford premium, I wanted to list down my night routine but unfortunately I need to have a premium that I thought listing down for a routine is free, I chose 2 options at the night routine but when I clicked another one,I was recommended to buy premium, I definitely recommend this app though,but I just don't have enough money."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"loving this app so far. Added this app again as it helped me heaps a few years ago."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do these apps get you to sign up then say you have to pay after a week? I just want some more structure in my life I don't have the money to pay for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After reading the reviews and the deception in regards to payments, I decided to uninstall it. I just didn't want to take any chances especially after reading in the comments that a customer was on a free trail basis and was charge through her PayPal without her consent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good so far but I don't think I've been using it long enough to have unlocked its full potential. May go up to five if it continues as it has so far. UPDATE: Uninstalled. It's really overwhelming and full of too many options. It doesn't just let you have some time to think or have a vacation where your routine is obviously different. I don't think this is the right app for me. You can't tell what it's really like in the trial period. Beware."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I use Fabulous and I feel Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to gamify improvement and productivity! The graphics are gorgeous, and the engagement approach is actually really satisfying and fun. As someone who is constantly on the hunt for ""that thing"" that's going motivate me, I think this might be it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app help me develop my life in to the greatest. That's a I can say .‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spent 4 days repeating the setup process over and over because it is 100 steps long. Finally start the first day of the app working and they charged me a year subscription! Never even got to try the app! What a scam!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app the UI and UX being colorful is really helpful. And the Live challenges are really great too! The rejection accepting challenge was really fun and growing. I came here from the channel ""how to ADHD"" and I am really grateful that I got to know about this app. Thank you everyone who is involved in making of this app, I'm truly grateful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got a tab, but no landscape, mode it sucks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sign up was okay. Then immediately, I'm pressured to spend $15 on the app. I've not used it before, I've barely heard anything about it - but oh, no, I won't have access to this aMaZiNg offer for a year if I don't take it now. I figure, okay, they say there's a free week, I'm sure they mean that within the free week they'll let me sign up at the discounted rate. No, it's $30+/year after the first week, due all at once. $15 I might be willing to drop after a one week test, but punishing me? Nah."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíØüëçüòú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app without really knowing what to expect. I was going through a major low moment in my relationship. After the first session, I felt so incredibly better and was able to shift my perspectives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm new to this, but so far I like it. It's a good encouragement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very gentle ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Free trial? I don't appreciate any app that doesn't tell you it's a subscription until after you've done the intro. I'm also not going to put in my card details just to try the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great application for people starting their journey. For those well on their way, there is not much. Needs a path for masters."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helped me üëç"

I am again tracking my weight loss on my own, and entering it along with exercise achievements. I'm happu with how easy it is to restart! I'm again embracing a healthier diet and exercise routine.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soo Good"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"great app it can be improve your productivity and if you didn't wanna buy the plan it's ad free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much going on. I downloaded to simply plan my day. It takes about 5 mins to do that becquse of SO MANY SURVEY QUESTIONS!! My gawd, i want to know who is collecting data here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am in the free trial period for TheFabulous app. ihave only been using the app for 4 days and am seeing improvements in the areas II sekected that needed help. This works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"More than awesome üëç. Premium version is a little bit costly but u can also download it's modified version from apkmody (website) for üÜì."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, this app is amazing! I like the amount of tasks you can add to your routine (from celebrating wins to brushing your teeth) and it is amazing to be able to see how visually beautiful the app is as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app works is an understatement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am a new user and my journey till now is great. I've been using fabulous since a week, and I am really enjoying it. This is the one reason that I am building more discipline in me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. The aesthetic is minimalistic and calm. When you start some habit or challenge, all the motivation messages, the story they tell you and the way the guide you is smooth and chill. Even you don't have premium, the app is really nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is great but only few habits are unlock otherwise all habits are lock ,if you don't join their premium feature until you can't open that and it's soo irritating. In the beginning I really enjoy to use this app but it's only for a few days after that there is nothing in the app only two habits and some daily motivation and some random stuff and that's it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it so much tysm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app. It helps me a lot the start my journey of personal growth."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved this app really motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Day 2 is too early to request I evaluate the app. Let's re-visit this on day 30. Already feeling like it may not work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its been awesome! I'm in the trial but I'll definitely be paying for this. I can't say no to more positivity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app had worked as well as expected.... Maybe better....I will update again after a few weeks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app was okay, I subscribed to an annual plan last year but canceled it before the end of the trial period because it wasn't for me. Yet the annual fee was charged one year later outside of Google, whereas there is no sign of the charge or an active subscription on Google Play. I emailed the app through the email address provided as contact twice, but no response for weeks. I am currently paying for something that is not even downloaded and i haven't opened for a year. Please resolve."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"almost perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Glory to God ü§éüôèüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greaaaaat"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Android Anger: This app is super helpful, but there are just a few things that make it frustrating if you're an android user. The weirdest example being, if you want to change your profile picture you have to ""contact our Member Care Team to request the change"" - Fabulous Help Page. I mean what is that??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really motivating me to change my life I really love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ask for to much.. Also ask for some fingerprints.. Didn't like the app.. Kind of some hypnotic.. I went for different purpose but app is like occupy and imply something different on you.. Did not feel like going through.. Sorry."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an app to better manage my routine so that I can build healthy habits. The monthly membership does that and also had lots of cool tools like daily inspirational coaching, guided meditations, and even bedtime stoories. Not to mention it is actually pretty affordable. I would highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disgraceful. Said ""enjoy a free week"" then charged my account $43. Only when I went back in it said I ""wasn't eligible"" for the free week. Refund. Please and thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes me healthier than ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Basically, I HAVE to get the premium to have anything. It will freely give me a reminder to drink water, but nothing else. Waste of my time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"BEST APP EVER!!!!!!!! But I really wish u could make everything free..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"When I used this app it was great. A bit repetitive, but cute. Wouldn't recommend the subscription tho because it's hellaciously hard to cancel, I don't have the option to change payment methods (eventho the website says I should be able to), my bank flagged it as fraud charges and it's inconvenient to continue to be woken up every time they try to charge my card SINCE I CANT CHANGE THE BILLING METHOD. I have submitted a ticket. Will update if things change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You should download this app if u r not motivated............"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE 7 DAY TRIAL - it's impossible to cancel it!!! Scam!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its so amazing i am getting better sleep"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still learning but loving it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a beautiful app with some really wonderful options and graphics for getting organized and motivated! I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gorgeous interface, soothing messages. My favorite thing is that not only is it a kind of checklist app, it has the actual tasks built in to the app, so if you say you're going to exercise- there's an actual exercise routine built right in that you can click and it coaches you through the moves. Same for breathing, cleaning, etc."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've never had an app like this before. It really works! I'm feeling a change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like being able to choose your own goals and the alarms that remind you to do them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps you create habits one small step at a time. I have been using this app and I have enjoyed the fun animations and the interesting stories."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me motivated and feelings accomplish. Doing something for myself in the am and pm after my devotionals and prayer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm impressed so far. It's more than just a check list."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Okay, maybe I just did a wrong choice, since I just wanted to find an app for daily routine checklista. Maybe I was ""not in resource"". But I spent about 10 minutes on: 1. Too much popups 2. Animations 3. Unskippable and uncancelable quizzes and guides - once you start it accidentally you cannot cancel it or go back. It all just annoyed me completely. Sorry, guys, I believe you're trying to do your best and help people. And I wish you good luck."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"From what I've found out it's a good app for bettering your routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's simple and easy to use. It helps to build long lasting habits and prepares your mind before you complete a task. If you want to feel motivated in the mornings and throughout the days I definitely recommend using this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app, love it to pieces! Helps me to remember my therapy work. Also helps me keep track of what I am supposed to do every day!!! Thx to How To ADHD for suggesting it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience! I downloaded to give a try and subscribe wit google but i didn't use the app enough and cancelled the subscription the next day before the free trial period expired, so a week after a received a notification from the bank app saying i was charged in $40 from fabulous app and i looked in the Google subscriptions and dont have any charge from them then i downloaded the app again to verify this charge and also dont have any purchase there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using the app off and on, but I do think this is a very good app in aiding building good habits. I hope that everyone that wants to work on these to get this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to follow along. I struggle with following any program, but this makes it easy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great, so long as you actually use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Offered a 30 day free trial which turned out to be ¬£1 at payment screen. It then bombarded me with further offers and after accidently clicking one, it tried taking ¬£56 without going to a payment screen. My bank instantly texted me to say theyd declined it so I know this app tried taking the payment without confirming anything with me. The bank blocked my card and had to reissue a new one to ensure this payment didnt go through. Outrageous from a mental wellbeing app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, a very useful tool and a powerful weapon!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like how it's simple and innovative graphics and to the point messages . Not too much, not too less"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Except for most of the app being only used after upgrading, it's a good app. Especially if you're just starting your improvement journey. It starts with a simple task, drink water when you wake up and then adds another task after you complete the current ones for three days in a row. It really helps building habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No way to change habit duration. No dark mode. No landscape (I had to force it in the Labs settings), not optimized for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. That's the FOURTH generation of this phone; you are clearly asleep at the wheel. No syncing between devices, only backing up and restoring, which takes AGES. If you already have an account and you install the app, it makes you go through the initial questionnaire."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have to downgrade this app since updating my phone OS yesterday. I've never seen an app so poorly optimized for a new update that it locks up my phone to all but the most basic inputs, even when the app is in the background. That's completely unacceptable. I will be uninstalling this app until it has been updated."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only offers annual subscription but tried to pass it off as a monthly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For an app that's targeted towards people with adhd, this is very over complicated and too much of an effort to use daily (I am medically diagnosed with adhd and this is my opinion). I honestly tried to use this properly and try to use it every day. However, I found myself getting annoyed with the god damn infinite notifications more than anything. The set up process for this app isn't particularly quick either, this made me lose focus and get bored of it kinda quickly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it! Great for planning üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just found out that the request to unsubscribe didn't go through and now I'm out $40. I didn't even finish making my account and they charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best application which I saw entire my life to make people beautyfully motivate and confident."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is simply amazing! This app helps you in ways you've never dreamed of! This app helps you with getting back on the right track and help you better yourself. You gotta get this app and try it for yourself. I love Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Finally, an app that is both encouraging and boosts the good that I've already accomplished. I like how it encourages healthy habits by making it easier to do them. Want to read more? Keep a book handy! Want to drink more water? Have a water bottle or glass on your bedside table! Lay out your exercise clothes the night before. Make a playlist of danceable music for household chores. Keep a box ready for thrift store donations. Make new habits easier!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I thought I was only signing up for a week long trial but it seems as if I paid 2 days ago? I wanted to cancel only to find out I have a year long membership already paid for..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love that they help me set small realistic goals and stay out of my own way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm not a big fan of surprises. When I got hit with the big subscription price, it was an unpleasant surprise. I left it on my phone to remind me to cancel it. I have a feeling it's going to be one of those shady deals where you jump through 99 hoops to cancel your subscription. I'll update you on it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to do and follow. Done with a relaxing setting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worthy to try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app and the premium version is very affordable and you can change your lifestyle in just 2 months. They deserve this rating and no ads if you get the premium version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't let me progress in my progress. It glitched after my water habit and unfortunately I never got to continue my journey. Was really excited to re try but am now very disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It helps me to get out of my depression. I like the design. I am obsessed with the letters from future me. It makes me happy to live one more day. I believe this app could be even better if you review nativity of in-app navigation and alow to combine journeys with challenges without quitting one or another. Many thanks for your great job. It's helpful, it works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how I can do my morning work and bedtime goals at my own pace. And not worry about a time limit or time frame. Also, there are no reminders to any of it. This app has helped me a lot with drinking more water"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam and will take your money without permission! You must sign up for the week long free trial and enter your card information to use the app at all. I canceled the free trial and uninstalled the app immediately and yet was charged $49.99 for a year subscription an hour later!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful! It's not advertised that the first week is free and then you have to pay the rest (REPOSTING)"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Small steps with high effect üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Far too premium gated and so many ads to try and make you upgrade. Feels like whatever the mission of the app was is lost in profit seeking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Really great concept but so much of the app feels predatory for users trying to better themselves."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing app...very very useful.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't use it for long but »ôi far I enjoy it, it has everything you need to actually stop procrastinating and work on yourself on any stats that you wish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This really works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is great! The only thing that sucks is, sense I'm not paying for the premium; I can only set 2 goals per time of day. But, It helps give you ideas of things you want to start making a healthy habit; either mentally or physically. And most importantly, it holds me accountable for those goals I have set. It walks you through everything you set as a goal for whatever time you set it to. It's gives you great advice, and uplifting quotes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so excited"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is nothing but a useless app and a gang of thief's. They took from me money and im not even subscribed."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a great app to help those of us who struggle making and/or sticking to a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changed my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes all your personal information then tells you there is no free option, 52$ per month subscription. Trash."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've just started using this app and so far I love it. I'm still in the free trial but do plan on buying a years subscription. I have difficulty getting thing done in a day but with this app I've been getting more done and at faster speeds. And the daily couchings are very claming and motvational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Full of encouragements!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. Be careful if you use this free trial.... I unsubscribed ages ago just to find out it never really cancelled and they have charged my husband's card for 2 annual payments of $40 per year. And the subscription doesn't show up on Google Play so that didn't seem quite right either. I really enjoyed this app at the time but decided not to use it because of the high cost. I'm really disappointed. If I cancelled 2 years ago and money was still taken that is stealing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I have trouble starting n following through on healthy habits, only day for but the steps are small enough to consistently do. I'm pretty hopeful and impressed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It was a really good and pleasant app that gives you a glimpse of how your day might be..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you follow the plans, you will see your habit is changing üòä I was very lazy. Now I feel the change. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good. Helps me do things I don't want tk do or struggle to do. It's the simple things I just don't do and this is fixing them like brush my teeth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small steps, that's the saying to live by!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Huge letdown. Was excited until I found out there's no free version. I decided to try the trial just so I could see this morning flowchart I saw in an ad. Nope! No flowchart!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to follow and build on good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please create a monthly subscription, 3 monthly subscriptions, because many users like me cannot afford annual subscriptions. Tell me when you make this change in your app i definitely but it and give new ratings regarding app development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a real life changer and great support if you're willing to do the work and be consistent. I do recommend it alongside long term therapy to get in touch with your full potential and inner divinity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional in just one word"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app, I've downloaded it 5 separate times over the last 8 years ü§£ I like the way this app speaks to you. Encouraging and gentle but persistent, celebrating you even when you break a streak. What I don't like is the constant bombardment of the premium subscription. It won't let you listen to any of the motivational coaching without the sub but it waves them in your face INCESSANTLY. Other than that, I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This App is so amazing. It'll help you grow, heal, feel better and confident. What all we need is a Lil' push. And this app does the job very flawlessly üíù"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for someone on a path of self awareness, self-care and self discovery. Try it out, You will not regret"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tries to force me into things as if I was a toddler. Hate the entire tone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Delighted with this app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscription is a scam scheme: you must unsubscribe in different device, allow for that 28 third-party cookies (incl. LinkedIn, Reddit), are not forewarned of payment date. Yes, app is very beautiful, but after you set up some list of habits to build, it is rigid and annoying if you wake up or go to bed at different times (eg. for work shifts) or want to journal a bit longer some day or your workweek differs from Monday-to-Friday. Edit a year later: despite unsubscribe they milked my card again!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM they Will ask you for 30 Day free, and the Will chrage without any notice and even option to cancel"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really easy and im starting to have a normal lofe amd not a mess"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I love this app, but I really hate that I can't put more than 2 tasks in my goals. If there's ever an update where you can give yourself more than 2 tasks in each routines, I'll most definitely reinstall. I have Autism and ADHD so it just personally doesn't work for me, and I love it has its own community, I just wish people could actually put their own posts on there, I feel like it would be easier to get insight and bring the community closer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst App ! I used in few days back and Subscription payment setup I done.They said at the time of Subscription cancel at anytime and Refund.But now without notification they scammed my money.Even I cancel the subscription it would not return back to me.I so much Frustrated with this APP. Don't you this scammer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The adds are ridiculously dumb why do you need to plan something that you do all your life like eating makeing bed and going to the bathroom it's so dumb and I hate seeing those adds I got sick of it just please change them I would rate a 0 if a could this is ridiculous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Looks Like a Professional App,.But I Just Needed Time Management(Because You Can't Dismiss At The First Step Into The App)And At First I Thought It's A More Sophisticated Podomoro Technique But Lol After I Tried It It's RoutineAnd Yep Like Most Other Applications It Paid / Provides Trial,.And Idk if it's just me or there are some people who are the same,.I'm a little allergic to the term 'Trial',.It's BetterIf YouProvide Free Options But With Limited Features Or Paid Of Course With More Feature"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've just started, but it has helped me support some of the growth that I was already determined to make. It starts with really small simple steps, and it keeps it from feeling like an unmanageable or overwhelming endeavor."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No words it changed me a little in just 2 3 days I just have to improve myself a little more but ik because of this app my journey will be amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It is helping me so much on my self love journey!!! I recommend this app to anyone who is letting go of old things, and need help on inviting in new and good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me money deceptively, no response to refund request! I was signing up for the premium trial but was shocked to see that I've been charged $67 for ""1 on 1 coaching"". Multiple refund request tickets and emails have gone unanswered. DO NOT LINK YOUR CREDIT CARD ON THIS APP"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has given me a new focus on life. It has given me a new start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged twice for my 5 dollar donation then charged 67 dollars for a premium subscription all on the same day, June 30th. Contacted company through support bot chat, PayPal and email no response yet. App was interesting but I will be uninstalling because of the shady billing issues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just a great way to keep you on track, with tiny - I mean really tiny goals that committed to daily will yield exponential results over time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps with making new good habits and breaking the bad ones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I really like this app however for some reason I can not progress with my journey. I tried support which takes several days to respond and doesn't even answer my question. Willing to pay for premium but it's useless if I cant progress in my journey."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've being using the app for several yards now. It has helped me to fix my bad habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"In the beginning the app fun a specially because there is a quiz but you'll find it hard and very annoying to keep up with the tasks. In my opinion this app is useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"it's a very fun and motivating app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a nice and user friendly app. I like it very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It wouldn't let me join unless I paid a memworship after a week"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has changed my life. It changed me: rewired my brain to think of what I want and how to achieve it. A big thank you to all of the team who works at the backstage üôèüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I find this really helpful for creating new habits, at least so far. App is a little buggy but now too bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just simply loving it !!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've tried a variety of coaching apps. This one is an excellent blend of options; forums with other users, short audio sessions with transcripts that can fit in whenever there is a short break in your day, and various trackers to document and reinforce progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good idea behind it. But there are some issues with the app. 1. My first journey was bugged and wouldn't progress. It kept on saying that I have to finish the previous step, which I had, but wouldn't unlock the next one. 2. Needs a favourite button to mark certain guides. 3. Be able to see the details of journeys before starting them. 4. Quit button for journeys (now you have to start a new one to quit the previous). 5. Be able to rejoin a journey (I can't find my first journey)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great for a person to develop his mindset and attain hi abilities. This app also helps him to wake up to the reality and makes him live in the present."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't fault this app in any way. The only thing that has bugged me is the length of the trial period. 7 days. And it bugs me because you get to give out guest passes where they can try it put for 30 days. I think that's a bit unfair considering that after 7 days, I'll have to pay the yearly subscription, whereas they get much longer to see if it's for them or not"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It teaches me to be mindful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app can be life changing for a lot of people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I usually don't rate apps often,(this is probably the second or third) but when i do, you should know that it is indeed the apex predator of its category. I am literally short of words for this fabulous application. No matter what you talk about, it is PERFECT down to the very last detail of it. Whether it be the relaxing design and sounds when using it or the perfectly designed journeys to transform yourself into a better version of you. Alright I have precisely reached my (500) character mark."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They say ots free but it's really NOT"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't get it to open."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's good, but there aren't a lot of options. If you don't have premium, other all would still recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tool for starting healthy habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Me hicieron un cargo a mi tarjeta sin autorizaci√≥n por un monto de m√°s de mil pesos, solo puedo cancelar desde internet y no por la app pero a√∫n as√≠ no me devuelven nada"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You cannot create routines for different days, for example, a routine for weekdays and another one for weekends. Or do different things, like taking a walk just on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays and not the other days, or if you're traveling on Thursday you cannot make exceptions to the rutine and say your traveling. If you read everyday but Wednesdays you cannot customize it. Is very flat, if you set up a rutine you have to do it everyday without exceptions or you lose your progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I couldn't even get a good feel for what I WOULD be able to do with the app without having to sign up for the free trial period, which means I had to give my credit card information. Even once I started the free trial, the options seemed to be a bunch of nothing special. I tried it out for a few days, found absolutely nothing special worth $40 a year for, so I cancelled it. If you're willing to pay money to go on pretend journeys and accomplish....nothing essentially, this is the app for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Compete money grab they don't actually care about you or your routine they just care about the money from the subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for establishing healthy habits and jumpstarting your day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A beautiful calming app, right when I need it most. I've been using it for a few days and it's helping to ground and calm me instantly. I recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unkind app Use of guilt and reverse psychology to try to get you to do premium. That's toxic. You can't follow your own rhythm and goals , they already have it defined for you. Lengths of motivational letters, too forced."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous and motivating!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is awesome it helped ! The premium membership is better I recommend everyone to enjoy your journey with fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ô° I have been only using it for a few days but everything is going al right. The overall approach to create habits is working for me. Leaving 4 star because they push the premium version a lot haha Also no bugs or problems with the app itself until now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. Very helpful...but it is a bit pricey..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been useful, from someone within the adhd esprecteum I feel I can be more organized in the day, for those day to day tasks... also I use Forest to focus even more. (and block apps)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app says I get a free week trial but I was immediately charge $40"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When you do the work, it works. It works better than anything else you can find. But you have to do the work. It's very small steps that lead to change with the best support I've ever found. If you're stuck, this is for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm at a low point in my life and trying to get back on my feet. This app so inspires me and gets me going that I always look forward to performing my tasks and it's never been like this. I'd recommend this app for anyone who is as undisciplined, confused and disorganized as i am to use this app to gather their lives back. I'm back again to add to my previous review. You have to become a FABULOUS person to succeed ‚ò∫Ô∏è thanks üëçüèæ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm trying to sign in in the app but the email id step is not going forward, kindly fix the issue please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using Fabulous for a while now, and so far it's been helping me to set goals that I manage to achieve. The type of goals the app set for me so far are associated with having a healthy lifestyle. I like how the app encourages me to start building healthy habits that will definitely a long way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great variety when it comes to meditations, guided activities etc, but this app was made by and for energetic, competitive extroverts. As someone who is none of that, many of the ""motivational"" letters and messages had rather the opposite effect. I'm not saying the app is bad per se, only that the writing and editing could use some work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have taken the first leap, so far it looks great. I like the way app has been designed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Did the 1 week trial and they charged me for a year anyways. Never recommending this app again and doing a charge back."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app has one of a kind entertaining and encouraging approach to boost people's morale to do their self planned daily activities while incorporating good habits. It covers all pillars of life food excercise relationship meditation work planning etc and display is beautiful and the loving voice that speaks your name to do your tasks all add up more to the motivation. Also there multiple communities and challenges that one can join.stubborn pop-ups ensure immediate task execution."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory and ableist: I gave this and several other routine apps a try, ultimately went with another A YEAR AGO and forgot about this one. BE AWARE the yearly subscription will auto-renew WITHOUT an email warning, and they will NOT refund you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Effective and fun"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app only one issue.. can't keep up with premium payments"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible shonky business. Will charge you even when you cancel subscription or of you part way subscribe but don't activate account, you will still get charged and they make it impossible to confirm your subscription. Website is like a maze, and I felt like the mouse who couldn't find the cheese. Even the chat bot was useless to be and there is no phone number. Don't install or use!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having small frequent encouragement messages and simple easy steps to forming better daily habits is really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried this app over a year ago through a free trial. I canceled before the trial expired. I've since had two separate charges from them for $39.99. The most recent charge occurred in 2023, one year after I first tried this app. I reached out to their customer service last year and they were no help, so this year (like last year) I had to cancel my credit card and dispute the charge. This app is not worth the hassle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was very unsure about this, and am only using it because I forgot to cancel before the trial expired. But it does have its use. It's not the app's fault that I'm too scattered to listen to it. I'll try and do better ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Idk"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have changed soo much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the best app i had tried so far..ü´∂"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this App!! ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing and so encouraging. I would even give this app six stars if I could for being so great. Problem is, the price for the full package is quite expensive. Especially the once off payment. Though I am curious if I can pay monthly. That would help me dearly. I would be so grateful if only I could. After all, that is affordable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Rally motivating and keeps you consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I wish some parts you didn't had to pay for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love everything about it. Only bummer is that non-premium users miss out on a lot of good stuff. Regardless, it's a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app, I'm enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just starting but going slow and steady. It's helping me complete daily tasks in all areas of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a very good app but it takes money for things that I add"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Oh my goodness what an app this is and this is a free app as well as premium. You will get everything here exercises ,yoga ,meditation and ..videos . So download it it's a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love fabulous! Its one of the few apps I have subscribed to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty great help with goals and motivation but it is better with the subscription so much better like it sucks without it üò≠üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been an amazing year with the fabulous app. I highly recommend it to follow routines, get inspired, and see another perspective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great companion and virtual person lifestyle coach"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice app this and that but why did it steal so much design from the app ""sky : children of the light"" AppüíÄüíÄü§®ü§® like it's VERY noticeable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"need to give fingerprint to use it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it here"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to follow through and a short useful daily coaching session included and it is personalized to what is important to you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful when you're feeling down. They have many many motivated speeches on here that are very calming. A community you can talk to. Learn to do new hobbies, learn to meditate, have small daily goals. So far so good, has helped me a lot and only on day 2. $40 a year. Worth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"damn good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helps when I commit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is hard for me to stick to routines, and I have tried so many apps and strategies to no avail. The very small, achievable goals and the meditations in Fabulous are really helping me. I feel more optimistic this time around that I can achieve something. I look forward to opening the app and working to get closer to the person I want to be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the positivity, and do wish it was a little cheaper but it's great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"50 50 , I'm on the fence , I don't like being pushed into the ""sharing"" for their advertisements"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous it is!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It helps me get my life together."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like reminders, I haven't missed my commitments so far and the inspirational quotes. I'm looking forward to future me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought it would've worked out better. I've tried this twice and both times was charged way more than what I signed up for even before the trial was over. Maybe the sign up isn't clear, but I'm a fairly intelligent person, so maybe it's made that way on purpose?? Then, in order to cancel anything you can't do it in the app, so you have to go to the website version. I was charged $70 for the ""trial"" to tell me to drink water for 3 days, and I hadn't even confirmed my email address yet..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expansive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid for a subscription back in September of last year. It worked until I switched Android devices. After i switched devices, the premium features quit working. Have messaged support multiple times, with no attempt to resolve issue. Do not recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. every body should take care of her/his self by learning true way of wealth, progress and life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is a fantastic app that incorporates science-backed principles to help users achieve their health and fitness goals. The interface is beautifully designed and easy to use, with customized programs and daily challenges to keep you engaged and motivated. I appreciate the variety of programs, from meditation to nutrition, that allow me to focus on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A good app honestly, just you have to be premium for 90% of the app, please fix that and i may give a 4 star review! Why 4 star? Because the app shape literally is a free app that you can't use without paying, like why even make the app even free to download at that point, Anyway sorry that i sound like a 50 year old man i am a child under 12 trying to improve myself more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a great app to build new habits...so if you're a fan of Atomic Habits by James Clear...or would simply like to begin making small changes that compound over time...it's a motivating and helpful way to do it. Highly recommend it for anyone keen to have a little automated help and motivation each day as you redesign and implement whatever you're needing to focus on or add in to improve the quality of your life and strength of your physical, mental, and overall health and wellbeing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Refreshing renewing and cleansing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice interface, but very upsetting that a purchased membership was required for extended use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Recently app is not working, lost progress on my journey & can't start any new journeys , clicking on journeys does nothing - it's completely non responsive, I've tried logging in and out & uninstalling & reinstalling - I have premium and was getting on quite well until now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"We'll designed and beautiful app, a lot of effort had gone into making this and it shows. Like the fact you can get the full version just by watching one ad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"like it all thought the additional app for tracking nutrition has a very uncomfortable focus on loosingbweight which isnt my MO and evenbwhen i chose the maintain weight option it seemed to focus on loosing some"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been just shy of a week, and I'm waking up feeling so much more full of purpose and drive, I feel more focused and connected to my surroundings I'm aware that some people have had issues with the free version of the app, I should clarify that I am paying to use the app, so my own experience may not mirror that of a user who does not subscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription after 2 days itself, however, they still deducted my money. It's a fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I helps you build habits and routines gradually taking small steps. The UI is awesome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I thought it was a good idea at first but then I could only put two prompts on my to do list for the morning Do not recommend tbh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I so much love this app, it really improved me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a horrible app and what horrible customer service. I signed up for a free trial subscription a little over a year ago. It asked me to ""donate"" for the free trial. I donated $1. It charged me 3 times! I let it go. No biggie. The trial ended. I kept using the app but didn't find it useful so I set it up to not renew the next year. This week I was charged for another year! CS is a chatbot with limited options and they refused my refund because I took 4 days because busy mom! Con job!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is so much nicer to be reminded to do the things that I struggle to remember to do!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much! It's so helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app years ago when it was still in early stages. I stopped using it for unrememberable reasons, recently rediscovered it and realised it was part of a pivotal moment in my life when I started to take control of who I was. It's come a long way since then, bringing a wonderful story into the science of habit building, and a dab of stoicism to boot! I wonder who I would be now, if I'd carried on using the app. ¬£30 a year is peanuts for a better way of life. Purchasing ASAP üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is amazing but i don't like it when it tells me to up grade anything else üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just a paywall rainbow. When will people learn we want to try something for a week or two before buying?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this makes me think about things diffently and prompts me to make more healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I cannot open journeys of the second mountain."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is too good and impactive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you Fabulous. I have finally found the right productivity app that contains exactly what I need. What's even more fabulous is that Fabulous provided a way for us to enjoy Fabulous Premium! Now, I can just watch one full ad and I'll have access to it the whole day. This can be applied every single day! Thank you, thank you, thank you, a million times. üíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very positive & insightful, no pressure, I really like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have picked this app some days ago, mostly out of curiosity. I can see it provides some good tools to help you build healthy habits and commit yourself to making changes in your life, steps by steps to become what you should be. I am very pleased. I had forgotten long ago how such a life of renouncing to the easy pleasures of life to get the more difficult and rewarding ones gives you such peace, happiness and contentment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app. But took twice the yearly payment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a very well made app, and has been surprisingly effective for what I am trying it out for. A lot of it seems to be subscriber content, but the people that recommended it to me say it's not that much more content, so, but I bet it's worth it if in you budget (it's not expensive, I just have too many subs already)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is that little daily boost of inspiration to remember what's important and what to let go of."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app cool ui I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredibly useful. As much as I wanted to hate the automated coaching/reflection, I like that too. Gives me a sense of accomplishment, keeps track and prompts me to do my habits in a pleasant and unobtrusive way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great. Once one start is easy to keep going"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They refused to refund me for a year of service 2 weeks in after I was unknowingly charged. That was after it took me in a loop and I had to struggle just to find the right place to request one. Horrible customer service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is way too good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam. Don't download it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Still my first week... it is easy enough to follow. I'll update as I get more information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is so nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this so far! I feel really happy when I get notifications from this app, like I'm reading a text from someone who cares about me. It's really encouraging. It keeps me on the right track when I start to fall into a bad habit and feel guilty again. The heart felt audios, messages, poems and tips all mean so much! And it's only less than $4 a month? ($40 a year). I think that's so great! I'm already recommending this app to my family and friends, and I'm less than a week in!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Everything is good when it comes to helping you stick to good Habits,the only down side is being asked to pay for extra things like day and night coaching,but other than that is is really good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app got me through covid lockdown. It's unfailingly positive and supportive. Whatever area of your life you need help with, this app has tailorable support to work with you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great app to take a new habit and to leave a bad one behind in a fun and interesting way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great motivation!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the story inside the app love the choice to do things love the app all around"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Monotonous long winded intro and some very socially toxic attitudes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was looking for an app to help with a daily schedule/routine. Something simple that I could adjust. This is not that the 1st 3 days it hade drink water when I got up then it added breakfast. It's very new age hippie, gentle parenting type feel. It's calming I guess but mostly not what I was looking for. Also it signed me up for the $39.99 a month version and I didn't want that. I caught it quick so I was refunded almost immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day 3, starting some healthy habits & building up morning. Workday, & bedtime routines. Optimistic this app will help get me on the path to reach my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been phenomenal for helping me build routines and my self esteem."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for changing your habits, one small habit at a time! There are a lot of positive healthy habits within the app as well as tons of ways to keep you motivated. It's very simple to use and helps you feel successful in making many changes towards a better life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Reminders without being overwhelming. The sounds are enjoyable like a video game."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Kind of expensive but I do like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I don't know this app is good bcuz there are to many buttons and if we want to see our work day routine they say unlock Premium... And something something üòüü§™üò°üòìüòüüòñüòæ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving itü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üòÉüëç and awesome üòéüòé app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"There are many things to like about this system! Much care and thought has been out in to the music, the narrative and the graphic design. I find it a little silly at times, that's the cynic in me. I already have a few of the habits, like starting each day with a glass of water, but I wasn't able to skip that goal. It's engaging and I'll continue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me encanta todo me encanta se que esto me va a ayudar a mejorar"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the daily nightly coaching sessions and for me it helps me to keep pushing myself through difficult periods"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is really Fabulous. But the one problem is you can do almost nothing without premium. And as a teenager that also in a strict *and depressing* family, I unfortunately can't afford that. Otherwise the app is just wonderful. I get motivated daily. The spirit inside me wakes up on its own to do the tasks assigned. I personally loved this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very interesting and amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app. My first week in and I'm enjoying it a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a lovely app. Gives so much positivity to me! Each morning i have started looking forward to reading a new positive article. Just 4 days till now, but i like it... Much better than the rest of the apps which just keep monitoring your daily tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the app..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Feels so satisfied"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Supreme"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"On the flow of journey... Encouraging, Beautiful arts favoring the feeling of hominess for returning into this sanctuary, Effective coachings and meditations and more... I'm grateful for the student premium discount as well. It'd be lovely if transferring premium subscription into different devices is easier and simple. But I do enjoy to my fullest, for every moment of being on the path with this Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you have the money for it- I say yes. Tip; They are offering way cheaper for us students. Or use the 7 day trial to see how you would like it. I was a bit iffy going into this, but I wanted to build a routine and knew I would be consistent if I had an app watching over me, this week- I am still improving on reading more consistently, but everything else is going well. In this world, we really have ourselves- so why not make an improvement with our relationship? I would recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the app its good to have a lot of these ways to work out and meditate and have a routine also work on certain habits to get you out of bed and stay active throughout the day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Massive pay wall. The app won't function in a meaningful way unless you pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many pop ups. I enjoyed this app when it was in beta. Now you finish a habit and have to close multiple prompts that pop up asking you to invite friends or show your progress map. It's tedious and ultimately led to me uninstalling. I would love for a feature where you can turn off the prompts to invite friends and family. Edit: @Fabulous, I have clicked every link on your website and in app. I don't see how to turn off those pop ups."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good morning Fabulous. I have just had 34.99 taken out of my account. I never had a reminder email to say I was going to be billed. I havnt seen anyway to contact anyone and I need my money back please. I have not used the app at all. ***update*** Customer service is fantastic! I emailed customer support and they helped me out the same day!! Brilliant! Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing... I just started but already developed some healthy habits that are truly habits...I do them without having to think..like drinking water and eating more healthy food... I could go on and on about The Fabulous... see for yourself.. get the app. I'm now using it on my Galaxy A53 phone...they have made improvements and I love it even more ..I'm depending on it every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Saumya"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderfully!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I can't do the best things they provided unless I pay for it. I have to admit I'm quite strict on spending money so I won't use it on such apps. However, the app does improve my lifestyle a bit better and I rll like the designs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is so different another application when I tried it. if you want to change yourself this thing could help you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It says this is free so you install...answer questions to find its only free for 7 days!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a go!. Even though I stopped using the app for long now, I observe all my morning routines. From drinking early morning water to exercise... which I don't do before. It's really #fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love coach & art work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yeah no thanks. Getting me invested in answering questions about my morning routine and personal traits and then just locking the result behind a paywall seems like a dishonest strategy. If you want me to trust my mental health in some way into your app, then you need to be really trustworthy and honest. And your onboarding experience is just not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has help me alot so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me motivated by switching things up and allows for different learning styles and uses different kinds of positive reinforcement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app so far! Update: is now 8 months later and I'm still using the tools this app provides! Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I would have loved to use the app but its free only for the first 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just Fabulous"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I absolutely love this app. The graphics are pretty, the voice is soothing and the daily coaching is full of Rumi quotes. It's definitely help me build routines. I wish you could assign each habit it's own reminder. You can snooze it and that helps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded it, but it's very nice! As someone whose entire life has been literally a daily routine everyday, I like this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This type app i wanted for a long time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a nice motivational app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The routines really help me follow up on my goals and tasks. I rarily do the challenges, but they are good for learning new things. I have some thoughts of improvements though: Past months in progress so I can see what i did after the month changes and compare, More routine pictures/colors available, to be able to choose if daily couching can be turned off or not, and choose to make mood tracker give me notifications so I remember to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app that I ever seen... seriously it's fabulous üòçüíìi truly appreciate the people who invented this app,,it help me to overcome my depression that lasting one and half year..if you are depressed and one who want to productive this is for you guys it's actually works ..but one think that I saw in this app that there were lot of activities that I think is unnecessary... although thank you fabulous team!‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing App! Everyone should try it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cheaply made scam designed to take money from you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been almost 3 weeks using this app, and I love it. It gets me to start small, and I love the feeling of actually ticking after getting the habit done ‚úîÔ∏è. I had days when I would forget to do them, so I added more reminders for me. So far still liking üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I can't even choose my favorite routine, when i removed my recent routine i can't change to others habit routine and it show me i should pay for the premium one to add others routine, now i would not remove my others routine or change it cuz i will couldn't add others thing :( but before this it just enjoyable.."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Baaaaaaasd"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is just like it's name fabulous. I didn't give 5 stars bcoz to experience more features in these needed to pay some amount and I don't want to"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started, and already see a change. I'm finding myself able to keep up a better attitude in my work environment that's usually very toxic, and able to keep calm. Overall, I never felt this good before and I've been waking up an hour before the alarm goes off on the app. I'm going to set the alarm to the time I wake up and see if I wake up earlier. First impressions, I love this app and encourage everyone to try it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the visual ! It's makes me so motivated !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I'm becoming a whole different person I don't remember the old me anymore!!! Now my new me is calm peaceful and less distracted"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This feels like a scam app almost. Very aggressive monetization, very expensive for basically a simple habit tracker. Incredible hard to cancel subscription and they make it hard on purpose so most people are paying the 1 year without even realising. Just read the rest of the reviews."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A perfect self growth app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Only downloaded and tried this app for two days, said I opted out of subscription yet, unexpectedly was charged. Trying to utilize it because I couldn't get a refund but not worth it and not helpful. Very disappointed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good for our life, for our health and for our future"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've completed the first week and am already happy with my new habits and willingness to change. Start small to see big results."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I kind of liked it. I'd rather have a paper version and only pay once. And it's the same work just I personalize more for myself because I don't ""fit"" with a lot of the options or recommendations or just in general."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb app for growth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"In spite of cancelling the subscription well in advance, the fees was debited from my account. Though I did it Google playstore, my category wasn't mentioned in the cancellation reasons. I feel cheated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started using this app about a year ago and have been in love with it since. It gives me great motivation and is always reminding me of my goals and where I want to be as an individual, both spiritually and physically. I never had set routines before, and it always made my life super hectic, but Fabulous really helped to solidify my morning and bedtime routines, and I've even added a midday routine to the roster as well. Super user-friendly and just an overall great self help application."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much costly for the aspirants."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I never motivated before by app I really care and enjoy all coaching of Fabolous thanks I rate 5star for your work to advise the future needs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app. I have been going through a lot in my life recently and fabulous has been really key in helping me build new routines and bring order and discipline to my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After using Fabulous, I can't think of another app that I would rather use.üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too difficult to manage account"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I highly recommend this app. It makes you do your habits as if you are on a journey to become amazing, isn't that awesome? The way they always try to include you in what habits they want you to do is excellent, I love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app to experience and i am so glad i got to know about thisüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Fabulous app! It gave me so much things abt happiness. But Why doesn't it keep my journeys when i sign in with the same google account on the another phone? It has good info abt how living better life but technically you didn't work well on it, I guess..ü§ï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth the hype"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fake appüò°üò°üò°üò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's science and it works. Give it a chance and you'll see results. The price is more than justified in my humble opinion. I return to this review every once in a while to actualise it and so far have never gone under 5 stars. This app, if used correctly, is worth so much more than what you pay into it for full functionality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous helps me work my habits in manageable bits over time. Can't wait to see the results in weeks, months and years. No change happens immediately overnight but having clear focus and motivation is key. This app does that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very slowly but it will inspire you to reach a goal each day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No in√≠cio o aplicativo era muito melhor, agora com as √∫ltimas atualiza√ß√£o est√° ruim. A vers√£o gratuita n√£o te encoraja a pagar pelo app, cheio de an√∫ncios, design n√£o √© limpo e eu perdi a vontade de usar o app e acompanhar meus h√°bitos."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed this app during a free trial and cancelled the subscription after several days. I've been unknowingly charged $39.99 US/year for three years now for a service I never signed up for. THIS APP IS A SCAM. Update: 'Member care' ran me around in circles. I provided all my info and they replied with boilerplate responses. Scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Essa √© uma ferramenta fant√°stica para quem busca realiza√ß√£o em sua vida."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yo sol√≠a ser una persona muy obsesionada a las redes sociales, pero desde que descargue est√° app, empec√© a enfocarme m√°s seguido en h√°bitos saludables que me han cambiado como persona. ¬° La recomiendo much√≠simo! üíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since they started. It has only gotten better and more robust. I still have times I fall off the wagon but this app really does help you get back up and build new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT RECOMMED. even though I'm a paying user, since recently, there's an in-app ad for a calorie-counting app that can't be disabled. support basically told me to ef off when I asked to remove it for me. my disappointment is immeasurable. I really like this app, but I do not want some eating-disorder-inducing BS in my life. stay away if you're an ED survivor, it's not worth the risk of a relapse. it's time to get back to a bullet journal ü§∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING: If you download the app and uninstall after, better contact them rather them directly. Assume you have Subscribed premium even if you got 2 emails asking you to activate. A scam. I downloaded the app and immediately uninstalled as I decided it's not for me. I just discovered a $55 charge on my credit card...I never agreed to any subscription. Now I can't get a refund...the bot it claiming I signed in directly on their website...which I didn't know existed. (Unwitting) Buyers Beware."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a very wonderful app. We can change our habits. But it's premium is too costly, because just for giving tips and achieving goals, who pays ‚Çπ3000+.Rather than getting premium, with ‚Çπ200 I can get a 1 GB data unlimited for a month. With that I can get my routine tips, different forms of exercises, self motivation, diet, small decisions from YouTube and google. And rather than paying ‚Çπ3300 for year I can pay just ‚Çπ2400 in data and enjoy my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Omg I said in simple word Best apps ever dan very useful and surely so much wonderful things inside"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't know if it's just me, but this app has a clunky and confusing UI. When I tried this app for the first time, I was easily getting lost on what I was pressing and what I was supposed to do in some parts. I uninstalled just because, even after spending a few minutes trying to get used to the app, it was too confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It does not give up on me no matter how flaky I am ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app for keeping your good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just got charged $34 for an app that I do not have. I had to dig through my Google account to know that it was ever downloaded in the 1st place and I have absolutely no clue how it got my Credit card information or how long this has been happening. I Would love to know who I can talk to about A refund And to know how many payments they have got. This is crazy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, I really liked the motivational messages, and the support to complete your goals. The graphics are really good, I enjoy it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free btw and they take your finger print to ""agree to the contract"". Price isn't bad tho, its 30 something a year, I just don't like to be decieved into anything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ad blocks the screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's great for building systems and developing kinder ways to see yourself. The only drawback is that it's primarily for healthy people. If you side from chronic illness or flare ups that keep you from sticking to your routine, it's like your progress ""resets"" instead of starting again after being sick. The challenges are a bit tough if you have physical limitations. I wish they had ""sick days"" or something that paused routines and gave simple tasks for healing. Otherwise, I highly recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really awesome üòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Your propoganda of this anti natural nonsense gets on my nerves. And not only mine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Used the app a year or more ago and let subscription expire. I found I needed it again mostly just to keep me on track. When I ""left"" I thought I would use other means to stay focused on goals but it just didn't happen so I'm back. Seems the interactive like interface feels like you have someone there cheering you on. Thanks Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The premium is slightly confusing? I got a 30 day free trial, then I got a mail saying the trial doesn't exist and I'm not on premium anymore? I got another mail that the month is for 0.99¬£, and another on my student email that it's for 4.99¬£, except I don't know how to apply any of them after the premium free trial ends on the app? The app always forwards me to the one-time subscription, so I'm very lost how to change that."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to follow without feeling rushed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Brilliant content, horrible tech. The app is super buggy, and was released without ample testing. I wanted to like this app, but got tired of yelling at my screen everytime I used it üòê"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, the app is a really good experience. Most important is that many of the exercises seem evidence-based. Plus, there's a lot of content to keep you working on yourself. Only issue so far is that the UI for the Homepage is super cluttered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good small goals to start with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull, always make a positive perspective, pull up when I feel so sad and lonely. You have to try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"You should tell us that the app isn't free before do me spend my time for 5 minutes answering a lot of questions about me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the idea but it is not as simple as it should be. Way too much notifications for example."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Like how easy it is to use. Interresting topics."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been at this a little over a week and it's been very enjoyable and helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The design and concept is great but every 5 Seconds you get forced to buy the premium version. For example you take the survey to get the ""perfect"" morning routine for you and at the end it says, if you want to see it, buy the premium version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Epic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I like the challenges and there's good ideas to help you follow through"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having the reminder to drink water when I get up in the morning helps me stay on track and think about the things I need to get done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a good app for those who have a fixed time of work. For people who work in rotational shifts or have a research-oriented lifestyle or work in security/vigilance, it does no good since the app is designed around the concept of having a fixed time of sleep/work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why did you make if free in the play store when there nothing free on the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how there us always help in fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is an awesome app, the one improvement I would suggest is to make the routine checklist less confusing. Because when you forget to log it, it would be better to be able to go to the previous day and log it. I tried but then I ended up logging that day's work on the next day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect app. Really helps me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find the daily challenges terrific in this app. They are always trying to build a better experience with this app. It is well worth the yearly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me in so many ways. It is so inspirational. I absolutely love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find it an excellent App. It helps you to create healthy habbits, which you cultivate everyday. All methods are scientifically grounded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to get in the groove of habits. I suffer from ADHD, and this app has helped me track and remember good habits. The plus side is that there are more self improvement suggestions besides helping with my ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivates me to be kind and loving and nurturing to myself every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's just too much I want to make a schedule for myself not want you to make it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't even get a refund. When I never used their app. I signed in for trial and didn't like the app so I deleted it. But after some time I realised they still kept the subscription and took 37.99‚Ç¨ from me without any notification praying that I wouldn't notice. Now I am here asking for refund but neither google and the developer are even listening to my request just bot that say its not possible. It might be a good app but now I only think of it as a money grabbing trap."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!! This app is basically a scam. It is super challenging to disable your subscription. You have to login via a browser, find right sections, confirm etc. Since it is not displayed in play store, user cannot track and deactivate on time. Please be aware that the app solely built to scam and no added value so far (non-sense emails, notifications only). *Update: the developer contacted below, it is a standard template answer. The app purposely hides unsubscribe option via website"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Engaging, artistic and starts with small achievable tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"About to uninstall as I have to conform to the app, rather than it being a tool to achieve what I want."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This does not replace a good friend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Overall it's really helpful but its insistence on sharing with others is so irritating I may delete it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I canceled this subscription over a year ago and they are still taking money out of my account. I would suggest no one download this because it will happen to you. They said it was canceled but i looked today and they took money out of my account again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Instead of letting me set my own goals, it assigned me goals. This was not what I was looking for, as I don't feel like it is specific to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not as expected"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's not bad it works pretty well, I've only had for about 4days so far so let's see,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!ü©∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Back to using Fabulous after 5 years. This app is the anchor which supports many aspects of life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love that the app encourages me, remind me to read the meaningful letters n audios and send me ways on how i can move closer to my goal to relax and recharge from the fast pace city life. Love itüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't waste my time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everything looks good, only some minor changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING. Very difficult to cancel subscription. I signed up for the trial, wasn't worth the $55/month, so I tried to cancel. The developer made it so you can't from the app. It tells you to do it on the website. I go to cancel on the website, and am told to cancel in the app. I opened a ticket, didn't hear from them and so had to cancel in PayPal. In my opinion, they've made cancellation difficult to cash in. There are free apps that do the same thing. Not worth even trying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped establish healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Past customers are being charged this week without authorization or consent. So when you cancel your account, they clearly save your billing info in case they want to steal $40 across thousands of ex-customers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fair experience. Let me carry on and see how it goes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why there's only annual subscription, I'm willing to pay monthly but I'm not paying annualy for something that I don't even know if it's going to help me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expensive to get premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is now horrible, the number ads it has always telling you to subscribe and you can only add two habits to each section before it tells you to upgrade!!! They dont care about your health or anything they just want your monthly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you don't have this app installed on your mobile device, I assure you you're missing out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keep me on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it helps me stay on task and know what you missed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I wish this app worked for my notifications on my smart watch"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very fun and easy to use app to practice mindfulness and develop healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a great friend in my pocket to keep me on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a great app, I improved my habit tremendously. I lost many fats, i get my work done. Many things are so great with fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app. It helps me feel motivated. I enjoy it because I feel like I can achieve more through using it. It is backed by behavioural science research at Duke uni. I would like to see more options on the how do you feel check-in. I had to stop my routines due to surgery and I wanted to log that but couldn't. But it really is a great app whatever your age. It helps me feel positive and enjoy each day as it comes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Omg I can't believe I got such good habits from this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app , it keeps me focused and reminds me daily to be a better person and helps me achieve my goalsüíê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Buggy. Kept freezing whenever it told me to drink water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app so much. But I think the subscription pricing is pretty aggressive and overvalued. You probably do not want to get attached to an app with 20/month subscription. If it was a normal subscription like 5/month, I would do it. I know there is a lot of value and content they have created. Also, I assume they have a lot of experts working on it. But a lot of other apps with the same situation have lower subscription fees! Update: they offer some discounts, let's see how that would go!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring, giving me hope & encouragement to get through the day ahead & the rest of my Fabulous life! Tyvm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I put this on my phone in Aug 22 intending to check it out. I don't recall even using it. Apparently, I signed up for a 2 week trial that led into a $39.99 QUARTERLY charge? Who pays that for an app? Not me. When I reached out to them about this, they were not sympathetic and held onto the several $39.99 charges. BEWARE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to follow, the story is an interesting feature the app is enjoyable to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seems odd for the app to use Alarms rather than Notifications. Also why is the notification title not aligned to the habit rather than a motivational text. Like the app itself, the notifications are too busy and causes anxiousness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the suggestions for habits, but the app itself feels very bloated. Trimming it down would help streamline the experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really good if you're ready to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful, engaging, and informative! There's a lot to go through on this app. It was so tempting to want to start everything right away. Taking each journey slowly I think is the key to lasting success with the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for 3 days. Normally I find alarms & notifications annoying, but The Fabulous manages to prompt me in ways that are unintrusive, yet persistent enough to actually remind me to get things done. Update: I've now been using The Fabulous for 3 years, and while the alarms & routines don't hold my attention the way they used to, the app has helped me to develop real habits for the first time in my life, and still helps me to find my feet when I'm feeling particularly scattered."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Njce"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm finding that this app is really keeping me focused on changes I want to make in my life. I can talk about changes I want to make in my life but it helps me much more if I can just pull it up everyday and know what I need to do and then it's a good feeling to check it off when I'm done... Even if I miss some of my activities I wanted to do, I don't judge myself and I just tried again the next day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have unsubcribed from the app within 2 days of the trial period. Hence, make sure no payment deduction is done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The first time in a long time I've been able to make meaningful changes to my negative habits. I've learned quite a few positive new habits so far too üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the app immensely. I have come to realize that the app was intricately designed by a team of caring and compassionate people. They recognize the silent battle persons face daily and developed an app in order to motvate, reassure and inspire others. Acts and intentions of that nature are to me the greatest forms of achievement a human being can have. Thank you so much to the team of fabulousüëçüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty life changing for me to use"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome and this thing is making my life changing in just a few Habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wellness that helps you stay focused. It has helped me relax after a stressful day. It has helped me remember what is important."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing! I really love it. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to change their life style a bit!ü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really gooddd"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Worth every penny xxx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using the app for about 2 weeks. But so far it's been a great at helping me change my habits and behavior. Now it's up to me to keep working with the app and at it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using fabulous for years, it was one of the reasons that makes me happy, i just love it sm üíóüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app sounds well and good. My issue is that I canceled the use and any further charges from them. Almost a year later, I get a charge from them. It was through my Google Pay without my permission and without a heads up. They were trying to be sneaky and get away with taking $40. This app isn't even downloaded on my phone. Check your accounts for a ""fabulous 650"" charge and request a refund if you haven't been using it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It keeps me on track with everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love love LOVE!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, clear, and consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect This is exactly what I needed. I love that the app is so easy to use and provides so many options to tailor your habit building to you. I love that the app explains the psychological process to you and even warns if you try to do too much at once. I normally don't pay for apps but this one is worth it. I do wish it had a family option, though. I also pay for the app for my daughter (9). I don't dictate what she puts in the app but I would like to be able to see how well she's doing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has actually improvedy daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I've tried, it has a holistic approach, from helping you working on your well-being, improve sleep, physical condition, it includes mindfulness and stoicism. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great motivation to what what you need to do, my only issue if that you can't retroactively complete your tasks if you forgot to do them the day before, so although you did remember the task you forgot to fill it in which can be really disheartening to ""loose"" your progress despite actually doing it..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's only free for a week. I can't comment on using the app as I uninstalled it, but listing it as 'in-app purchases' doesn't feel right as after one week the app bills you a monthly subscription that you can't opt out of. Let people make an informed choice and tell them this before they sign up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the TOP apps, if not the best one for building great habits... Im using it daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous has helped me get my life on track and just by doing a little a day just give me that sense of control over my own life that I needed. üôÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has truely helped me and I'm beyond grateful I found it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You need to try it. Changing comes with baby steps and faith. Go for it and check the results !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful well designed app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app. I like that it keeps everything manageable and modest. One foot in front of the other. I do wish I could see the overall plan more but maybe that is part of it?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Mabye a good app, but not for me because I'm working on shifts and it's almost impossible to build any habits with this app. Just because I'm allways waking up in different time and I'm working night shifts so please add some options for people like me. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't use this garbadge. Cheaply made. Insanely difficult to cancel the free trial. You shouldnt have to go through pages on a website only to be followed by a final offer to keep using it to cancel a subscription that claims to be no commitment when it makes you put in credit card info for a free trial. It's confusing to cancel. It's a grift straight up taking advantage of people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful! I use a few self improvement/routine planning apps and this is one I always return to. & The subscription price and value its well worth the investment. Some others I use cost 10x as much for an annual sub. This is the only one that helped me build lasting healthy habbits I apply to my daily life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It a great app. It's only been a week so I will say 4 stars for now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful starting with a small simple step! Thank you so much, Fabulous Team!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the encouragement and extras in this app. I recommend it for anyone planning to grow their well-being!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Going well but has a lot of notifications which are difficult to manage and mean I am actual doing less digital detox and more managing this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If I say you guys are fabulous, wouldn't that be clich√©? Downloaded, and haven't regretted my decision so far, up next, premium. Way to go dev team!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's amazing I only use it for 3 days and it was so fun but it's only 4 stars cuz half of everything is supposed to be premium and it is my bday tomorrow I will try to get premium tomorrow maybe???but it's still a good app‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and rewarding"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app to help you develop habits. It has a bit of bloat but overall it achieves its purpose well. Gives out reminders about tasks you set for yourself amd a physical feedback when you achieve it. Sehr gut."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a life coach and if I could create an app it would be this!! This is seriously an amazing app. I highly recommend! I love it for myself and I recommend it to my clients."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for forming healthy habits, goal setting and tracking. You have to do the work but apps helps you do it better. Never crushed on me."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still early but I like it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Interessante, ainda estou entendendo o APP, mas est√° ajudando a criar bons h√°bitos, alguns eu j√° tinha."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful app, great graphics, takes a minute or two to learn how to navigate it but over all really happy so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst experience! Made the mistake of clicking trial, app is unsuitable for my daily use and they keep charging you annually (2nd time!) I haven't used it for a day or even logged in and they refuse to refund. What a scam! Best is I don't have the app and doesn't show on my playstore, only they have my credentials so they have been so wonderful to terminate membership for me after charging me. Refuse to refund and I can't still login for the current year that they have already charged. Twisted!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"con la versi√≥n premiun puedes lograr mucho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this is honestly the first time I was able to motivate myself doing tasks through an app. once I got past the cheesiness of the narration it really helped me be more mindful of positive habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app will never give up on you. I have changed more in a week with this app than I have in years!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great accountability and easy to create individual goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works. I've been productive now for a week. Slowly getting back on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the concept. It has helped me drink more water as I should be. The only thing that would be nice is if you could add more than 4 habits on a routine without having to pay for premium. Anyways love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wonderful application, exceeded my expectations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the kick in the butt I needed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great at building habits incrementally. Even after you develop the habits that you wanted to I still keep the app for the daily motivational quotes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle, yet highly inspiring motivator. This app is actually genius. It serves the purpose of pushing you to be consistent. I love the colors and chime sounds that I hear every time I check off one of my daily goals. The goals options are vast. They range from anything as small as flossing to something typical like exercise. You choose. There is guided meditation and daily focus coaching with excellent content and more. I appreciate this app. It is a wonderful way to keep me on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Everything designed to give an incredible experience. I love fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for almost 3 months and it's been very helpful along with time tracking. I've never been so capable of building a healthy routine like I am now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"4.7 stars. Reall good, daily reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is really transforming!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So confusing and looks or does nothing like the ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much notifications! Too much lecturing! Too much too long to read motivation speech or something! Too much of thinking that the users are dumb!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this so far. Day 4 and so much more focused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Used to be 5 stars but they've made a bunch of changes now, some of which I like but some I don't -- for instance, they removed a lot of the preset tasks (stretching, taking medicine, etc) which forces you to get premium since you only have so many custom tasks. These are really basic and common tasks that should have stayed built in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the accountability, yet flexibility designed into this app. I recommend it to anyone looking to build habits and bring Spiritual alignment to their life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it a lot keeps me on track with my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still learning to navigate the site, but like it very much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually life changing. It's gentle and positive, guiding you towards the life you deserve."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When I looked throught the pictures and of everything before I downloaded it I was mezmerized but then after that,after I saw that it was not free I was really upset"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"LOVEEE THISS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing, this keep me consistent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous fantastic amazing i don't have words to express my interest towards this app. Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a great app. Aesthetically pleasing while offering a lot of content without being overwhelming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its very good but i would like it even more or even further if you can make it less by adding less money in to the monthly subscription please thank you and have a nice day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An app I'll never regret downloading or take for granted. It has added value and returned the meaning I had been missing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still a new user, but from what I've seen the app is a great way to begin keeping track of creating positive habits over time. It has gentle nudges to remind you to complete a task. It's very encouraging and well paced."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled & uninstalled it immediately (way before the free trial ended), but was still charged annual fee. I contacted the customer service but never received an answer. Can't imagine how such incompetent company can help you improve your daily life & time management?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very nice app, till now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivational quotes üëè üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I got wellness by using this application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very soothing, well designed science backed experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Apprehensive to say I enjoy it. I had this once, had billing issues, it was a whole thing. But I'm back, looking to create new habits for myself and I *DO* like the app. Currently everything seems to be good, but I've not been on it for long. I'm having some trouble doing the guided sessions, they're tough to navigate or find. But that could absolutely be user error. I don't mind the notifications... maybe I'm dumb, but that's the point right? it's to remind you?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel, tried the free trail with the subscription that follows I didn't get full access during the free trial which I thought kinda defeated the point of a trial to try the app to see if it worked for u, they tried to take payment earlier than scheduled and now it Impossible to cancel my subscription! I just keep going round in circles with the bot chat and there is nothing anywhere of how to chat to a real person. Very frustrating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful to build new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has truly worked for me!! Thank you üôèüèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Is alright, stop asking to get tested and ease with the guest pass guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love all the new updates this is a great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the daily stories as I complete my routines. They bring in a sense of wonder and adventure to building my habits that I've never experienced before. It really is quite motivating. Thank you Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Demands credit card before even trying the app ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it for morning routine !!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a premium member, so even though there are days, weeks or even months that I don't engage with the app it's always there when I need it. Love the guided meditations and breathing exercises. The challenges are also very good when you need one. I became a premium member, because I know that working on my mental and physical well-being is a continuous process, that really never ends. Thanks team fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very useful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Same as Melanie Kock. I loved the app, but now I can't change the language back to english/can't access all the features. I tried everything from the help center/redownloaded everything - nothing worked!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice app for habit building"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot to Fabulous team! I was born in an average family and nobody around praises me few times a day. Fabulous app keeps praises me for my small steps. My life is messy and I use the app once in a week, still it is very effective. I will definetly pay for it when I have more funds. Thanks a million!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience if you are consistent in usingvit daily.Great stuff ie meditation,breathing..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My bug of 2 habit limit has been resolved, and the support teem was very attentive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am beginning to love this app one day at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've tried to get in contact with them for over a month as had issues with signing up. Now they just deducted money from my account and I haven't got the app and there is no way of getting in touch with a human. The robot chat bot is no help either."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"crashed as soon as i open the app... so i uninstall it right away"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started a few days ago. Enjoying it so far! (Update) Really liking the gentle approach-- good for those of us who tend to be very self-critical."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great art but the product is lacking. It treats you like a child, starting with a three day plan to drink water, then a three day plan to eat breakfast. I need something with more substance. It's also very eager to ask for money before showing the product (a worrying sign) and sends a lot of irrelevant notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Part of my daily life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the way of animating my regular schedule"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Very overwhelming..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only paid option. Bunch of frauds. They are telling you ""we will not send you emails"" and next thing they do is sending you emails with offers. At least two per day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It has so much potential but you can't do anything if you don't have the pro version. I'm 16 and have no money, and just want something to help me keep a routine for school. You can't add more than 3 tasks per routine set, stuff like that. Really disappointing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been helping succeed in my daily goals plus great app I suggest everyone give it a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They only give you the price AFTER they have collect your email. Also no trial without them colleting your credit card also. Ridiculous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this application it's really helped me in achieving the person I want to be"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This feels like such a scam, I signed up for 30 days free premium, then went into my Google account/subscriptions and cancelled the paid sub. But they have a separate website and it's not easy or intuitive, and traps you for a yearly subscription renewal... I have now cancelled but the payment is still pending and I assume as soon as there is money on the card, they will take it out even though I don't want the service. Feels very scam-like..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just Feel Amazing Than Ever Before"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great and intuitive. Good behaviour track and training, interesting challenges and live community to support those challenges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, confusing prompts"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant it's helping me with my everyday struggles of anxiety. I've learnt to breath more and worry less. The montly subscription is very cheap which is great as I can't afford therapy and this helps. I recommend this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Early days but looking very promising."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track & it has interesting lively apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never set up an account, but I'm being charged a lot of money twice within a couple weeks. If I haven't set up an account, then how do they know what I need. They say I can cancel at the Google Play Store, but it's not listed there. In order to check my account in the app, they ask tons of questions and need my fingerprint to commit? No way! No access to my account. This is too fishy for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I mean i'ts cool but i think this app needs more idioms because i talk spanish than english and sometimes i can't understand what are they trying to say but the app is cool it help me a bit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! It has helped me develop some healthy new habits and I've recommended it to friends."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App for motivation and support for changes !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have faith on the journal. Best app out there for ADHD adults. Although I don't always stick to the routine it's always there when I want return. Highly recommend to invest in a premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pay for premium or watch an ad for 1 day of premium?? Best solution ever, if all apps took this approach, everyone would be happier"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app it is excellent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate time consuming tests with psychological hooks leading to payout. You have no support in this practice from me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app actually makes good habits feel like a game, that is why you keep doing them!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charges subscription fee without warning. No help available! They are all cute... ""Sure go ahead and cancel--next year's charge!"" Will report the fraudulent use of my credit card. So angry this app was recommended to me. No customer service, the app refers you to the website to cancel, the website says you have to use the app. The only scientific method this app uses is constantly trying to get you to recommend it to others. It spreads like a thieving virus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For free week trial you have to subscribe and give your payment information and even when you unsubscribe before week you cant get your payment back. And impossible to contact someone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"im using the free trial, and i love it! I have ADHD and really look forward to the insperational quotes.and checking off my list daily.i highly recommend this app for getting many aspects of your life in order.give it a chance,you'll thank yourself! üå∏üåºüå∏ *UPDATE* I got the premium subscription & love it sooo much! I have ADHD, and I did fall off my habits for almost a month! but I'm ready to get focused again, because I honestly üôèfelt soo much better and more in control of myself & my life.üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When I signed up for the free 30-day trial, I was charged for an annual subscription immediately. After having the annual subscription for a month, they just tried to charge me for yet another annual subscription. This is the 2nd time I've tried this app & had billing/membership problems. The ability to contact them regarding a problem is limited, and the app is not worth the trouble. *They have now ""cancelled"" my subscription for ""unpaid invoice"" despite the initial charge for a full year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's good but the constant reminders get annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's only been a few days, so I can't give an in-depth review, but so far, so food. I've been looking for an effective habit tracking system for a while now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app makes it really simple to engage in healthy activities and track them. Also love their meditation series"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly helpful if you struggle with routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been accompanied by Fabulous now for over a year.

I love that there is so much to choose from. I enjoy all the different coaching lessons. Adding in the FB Live Challenges & Support Groups gives even more push to staying on track with my goals. Highly recommend this app! 7-5-22: Great reminder each day to help reach goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"edit: Thank you for listening! Appreciate getting meditation back as an option as well as the ad revenue model. Original review:Developers keep changing for higher monetization. Great concept, except now it's hard to add any function without paying. Edit: Now that I upgraded phone and download it again they're further limiting options such as taking off meditation options which I used regularly."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Havnt had the app in years. I know for a fact i cancelled it and somehow randomly charged me 40 dollars. Looked it up and other people have the same issue. Dont use this app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its honestly really useful if you want to better yourself. If you complain about the app not being useful, your wrong you just won't open the app yourself, plus they give MANY notifications so you can become better then what you are now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Make it clear that it's a trial and then pay for a week future me was a lier because he like me ain't paying for this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app and find it helps motivate me to complete my habits! It also has a lot of habits (with coaching sessions you can listen to) for mental health, at least in the premium version it does. The premium subscription also isn't expensive. I even told my counselor about it and she liked the concept!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just love this app. Very helpful to building any healthy habit or tracking habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Recomendada"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it is a really good app! I have joined this app a week ago and already feel like I am making progress all thanks to your guided support. I feel like my procrastination has definitely reduced. Thank you Fabulous team!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I appreciate the friendly, positive reminders and processes that guide me to reveal, and revel in, my best self!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An option for way less spam would be nice(10+ notifications per day is a bit much), or maybe changing the notification sound to something soothing that easily fades into the background so I can work AND be reminded of my goals. It would also be fun to make different notification sounds for different goals similar to WhatsApp custom ringtones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for habit building, clarifying one's use of time, and both generic and personalized reflection. This app is not a scheduler. It teaches and guides clients through the steps for making habitual changes that are long-lasting. The premium version was worth the money. Many people claimed to have suffered a great deal of anxiety during COVID due to the chaos and rapid changes to their daily routines. I attribute my quick and nearly painless adapting to the dedicated use of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app, but I would really love some kind of widget functionality"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I have to be rich to get yall to help me have a better lifestyle. üåöüíÄ those rates are insane."

I'm by no means a perfect person when it comes to always meeting my goals bit with this app I find that I'm consistently achieving what I set out to do and it helps me stay in track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is not perfect, but it is very effective. I think the user interface could be improved a tad. It is still worth the $40 fee if you are ready to commit to adapting healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like it, but hard to modify for Personal needs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it so far! I am noticing positive changes!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far my experience has been amazing, I was originally looking for help for ADHD and help with organisation, but I have found so much more. I have been able to continuously help myself through the tools and resources in fabulous as well as wonderful people in the fabulous community that I never thought would be possible. And long may it continue. Highly recommend you try this App."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a really lovely, positive amd engaging app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has given me the opportunity and ability to take control of my life and make serious steps into addressing my mental health. For nearly 2 years I've used it every day and once you've set up it's easy to use and customise. The guided meditations are very good and there's plenty of other things that I'm yet to even try. For me it has been worth every penny of the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muy buena para crear nuevos h√°bitos saludables"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app tries so hard to be useful and just fails from step 1. From the annoying music upon opening, tons of infographics stolen directly from Facebook and Mommy bloggers, dozens of daily notifications, cluttered interface, confusing navigating. All you had to do was just help people get a little more organized w/ daily routines, instead you annoy the hell out of them. i used this app for 3 months and the most benefit I got from it was uninstalling. Don't believe the hype, not worth the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am embracing my life and the changes I want to make. This will be the tool to teach me how to establish foundations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app helps keep me on track, and it's helped me get back on track. I have used it years ago. Came back to it, cause life's gotten challenging. This really helps to be mindful, and helps me to manage life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Indispensable to my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For those of us who need some support with routine and structure... from the stoic philosophers and other forward thinking literary folk. Yes, we all love Bruce Lee and The Alchemist. That's clear. And Hafiz and Rumi. And the poem about not falling into the same hole. Hopefully we can all climb out of our holes and walk on a different street of our own choosing... I'm trying hard here!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Needs more coaching packs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been an enjoyable experience so far and a grear way to start new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ask and store your email before to inform you that you must pay to use the app. It's just want to have data."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really has helped me create healthy habits and routines and work towards my goals. As someone with ADHD I didn't think I'd ever have these skills. Been using on and off since 2019 and the available coaching, journeys and meditations have grown so much, with a huge range and specialised trainings for coping with addiction. A really great investment in yourself and have recommended to many people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been great to know you guys üòú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great concessions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Usage so mch data when I install and use some times data used 350"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its name says everything, it's fabulous. If you're struggling to achieve your objectives, to learn how to self love, to manage time and discipline, this app will help you do it. I'm learning a lot and evolving a lot too. Lear to love yourself is the best thing you can do yourself and to others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß° Amazing !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a different habits tracker than the one I'd been using. I liked the old one, but I'd gotten too complacent. Fabulous is a different take. It's a habit tracker, but you are guided to which habits to choose, in line with goals you select. It's not just a simple checklist. But I find that great. I'm more engaged. You can tweak it and make it your own, including create habits. I like the reminders. Best of all, I like the 1 step @ a time, don't ve hard on yourself mantra."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A few quirks but overall a good app that helps me build good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded it yesterday and was so excited to use this but then I knew it's paid aap üòî and now I'm deleting it.. I don't understand why we have to pay in aaps.. Anyways.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me encanta esta app. ¬°Me da tanta paz interior! Me hace reflexionar sobre las cosas, ayuda a subir √°nimo y m√≠ autoestima, baja la ansiedad. La app va convirtiendo en mi mejor amigo y ya es una gran parte de mi rutina diaria."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Does what it promises to do and have highly involved and caring support staff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Is a nice app.... I will keep use nf it and see how it goes. But surely we recommend it for anyone trying to build new healthy habit and productive routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This has got to be the best self-care app I've seen so far. It encourages you to build healthy routines. And unlike other apps it encourages you to stick to them, asking if you have completed that task on a daily basis rather than just when it is an active challenge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app. it's extremely helpful and well designed, with a user-friendly UI and tons of options on routine plans and helpful coaching tips."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is okay. Maybe for someone who wants to pay for extras but I just want reminders and a place to write down thoughts. Not a monthly or yearly charge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's literally changed me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, thought out, and fun too!! Fabulous helps and encouraginges its users every step of the way. They work WITH you to get you where YOU want to be. Plus, it progresses as an adventure story might, beautiful and thought-provoking visual arts, and many paths to choose from. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to make a positive change in their lives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful graphics. Building food habits and mind set is hard. This makes it easy. It keeps me on track. I love the focus coach, the daily coach, but I especially like the nighttime guy. I feel safe when I fall asleep."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. This is the first time I've paid for an app and I'm soooo happy I did.... I'll never need another lifestyle app... love it and would recommend it to everyone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app with wonderful visuals. It's actually helped me live a more balanced life, so I would recommend it to everyone, although it is expensive at around 70AUD. But overall, it's definitely improved my mental health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for daily routine making ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Starting my journey to healthier life with this app :) It's the perfect app for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Smart, Focused, Deep and Thought-Provoking quotes and passages. Great way to stay on task, and then also calm the mind to sleep at night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great self development app ‚ù£Ô∏è works wonders in its job"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for over two and a half years now. During that time, I have experienced fundamental and massive changes in how I see myself and the world. This app gives me the time and space to create and maintain peace of mind through small, daily guided steps. Grateful, it starts with just that glass of water. This is a well-recommended app to use. It contains coaching, breathing, meditation, and exercise sessions to ensure a holistic and evidence-based approach to well-being and peace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I always keep leaving and coming back to this app but that's mainly because of my struggles and mental issues. Having this app helps me with feeling in control over my day and I like the option of watching ads to get the premium for a day since I don't always use it and paying a monthly subscription or buying an app that I only use every once in a while is a bit unwise. I would like if there's a more options and challenges but it's so far been great and useful and easy to navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Got a disciplined lifestyle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this motivational and redirecting routine. When you've maybe lost your rythem or changing lifestyles they help get you started again in the right direction. I took it a little too fast and later had to slow down. I like that you can constantly change, move around items as you change for the good or struggle in others. Thanks for the constant encouragement and acceptance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best thing to implement in my lifetime...love love ‚ù§ it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"so far so good. only glitch so far is even after I click complete on breakfast routine, it pops up again, click complete again, pops up again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is pretty good i mean I'm not experiencing any adds or anything, it also has alot of exercise and meditation is really relaxing I'm surprised that it also has a reminder to drink water . It hasn't really made any changes to me but I'm feeling good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app worth the price. Wish there were multiple challenges to do at once (ex: exercise and drinking water) but I understand why it doesn't do that. Not always intuitive to use bit you get used to it. Solid 4 of 5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app it has helped me so much. Highly recommend it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the Fabulous app. I've used it for the last 3 years and it's absolutely one of the most helpful apps I've found for tracking habits, physical and mental health, goal setting and tracking, etc."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app is enjoyable. Some of the story telling seems to cut off the progress until you login again. But so far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started using it barely one week, and this should be a treasured gift for anyone who wants an integrated lifestyle. This is one of the best decisions I took this year. It keeps getting better. There are plateus, but I definitely get up."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have premium, I think its worth it. Puts me back on track and helps program automatic behaviors, and since they're saved if I fall out I can just reactivate my routine."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it helped me a lot... whoever made it. God bless youüíóüíóüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"cancelled my membership 2 months ago and they are still charging me even after the charge was declined by my bank multiple times. it shouldnt be such a hassle to cancel membership"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged $100 in the first 2 weeks. There is a $50 coaching plan charge. I still have no idea what that is. I think it's just access to pre-recorded ""inspirational"" messages. I was also charged a set-up fee of $16. Again, no idea what that's for. On top of that is the $40 quarterly charge. Needless to say, I cancelled and blocked the company from charging me even more. Save yourself time and money and do not get involved in this money grab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started my FREE 7 day trial period and so far it's going good... it's easy to understand and it helps guide your progress daily...there are different subject groups you can participate in for encouragement...they bill you yearly if you continue the membership after the FREE 7 DAYS...it comes out only $3.33 a month so it's worth it if you like the app... üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm having a wonderful first day experience of building habits using fabulous. The app has a lot of ingredients that are helpful Flowgame Host"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"drink water reminder for 39.99$"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its good but i don't want to pay. lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I've been using the app for almost 4 months. At the beginning I was so in love with it that I bought Premium. In the beginning the content was great - motivating, with interesting and valuable habits to track. However, the more I progressed into the journeys, the more tedious it became. Now all my 3 routines are huge lists with a bunch of stuff I don't do at all (because it's too much/not for me). Some habits don't make sense, for example if you follow a different diet. It's just overloaded now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not get this app, it will keep changing you after you cancel it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good! Is so easy to do and also fun! :D"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic positive behavioural psychologist coaching daily to help create new positive habits and replace undesired habits. Whilst it (deliberately) takes a slow approach - worth getting in the habit of using daily. It took me a while to realise it is possible to create/ customise your own habits tailored to own personal needs. Perhaps some better guidance/FAQ would help with this. Dont really understand 'mountains' but a great app. I am sleeping better, reading more, fitter, new hobby etc..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Had this App only for a few days by now but I really like it so far. The Artworks are great and the little story's are nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the morning and evening ""chats""/meditations!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app and check your bank!! I deleted the app and stopped my payments to them through Google Play. Just a few days ago while checking my bank I noticed a purchase from ""Fabulous App Paris"" and tracked it back to this app. I checked my subscriptions and purchase history in Google Play Billing to see if I had forgotten to cancel but there were no purchases made to this app recorded. It seems like they are relying on people not remembering the app to continue unwanted subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Cancelled my subscription from Google. They went around and charged my Paypal account. I didn't like the app at all and cancelled it several hours after being forced to sign up if I really wanted to use it. I am so angry right now. THIS IS CALLED STEALING!!! ..... I was able to get the app cancelled and my money refunded. Thank you very much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Run by scammers. Fake 5* reviews. If you cancel your subscription they charge you anyway. If you write on support, they ignore you. Google also ignores refund requests. Dont put your card details in unless you want to get scammed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Let's motivate yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How do you cancel this app? It is not appearing in Google subscriptions?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"after 30 second setup they need to charge cash every month. bad form. Terrible vibes. Dogwipe service"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Edit: I was able to make most of the things work now, and I'm somewhat satisfied. However the alarms are not reliable, they will ring one day and not another. It might not be the app's fault though. Old: Back in 2016 I used to love the app, but after trying it again I found out that there were a lot of habits missing, like the stretch habit. Also the UI and visual is horrible now, what happened?!! I came back ready to purchase the lifetime version but I don't think I can use this app anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app‚ù£Ô∏è I want to keep growing and I'm ready for a new start‚ù£Ô∏èü´∂üèæüåà"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app so far......I am on a 30 day trial so after that If i love this i will buy the annual subscription.... One Request- please add more bedtime stories."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The people who use this app have fallen victim to deception and dishonesty. The scientific studies that support this app are essentially nowhere to be found, and the few that can be found are riddled with biases and lack replicability."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's the best app ever l love the circles!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged twice and no one ever responded after multiple attempts of communication. Edi I WAS CHARGED AGAIN!!!! I HAVE CANCELED TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT AND CONTINUE BEING CHARGED AFTER BEING CHARGED TWICE INITIALLY!!! GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK NOW!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've had good experiences the whole time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its amazing you can get used to the habits eadily with the technics"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded because they advertised a way to figure out my type of ADHD and help me manage. There is no mention of ADHD in the app at all. Advert was misleading and deceptive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good customer service"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So far I'm into it. I appreciate the very easy attainable goals set at the beginning to get you motivated to keep going. UPDATE: I don't need it anymore but the process of cancelling your membership is ridiculously, greedily tedious and multi-steps. Literally a wild goose chase to find the exact website and button to click to get to cancelling; multiple steps that tried to trick you into signing in again, and then the constant ""are you sure"" buttons to click through."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, and I respect this is worth paying for. But a monthly option would have been for me to upgrade. I don't have that much money to go annually"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a nice daily routine planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good but disappointed there isn't a widget at all. I have adhd I need visual reminders, I will just clear my push notifications. I also don't really understand how to see them in the mornings so i don't use it much. This is my second time trying this & I remember why I stopped the first time. Need at least a few widget options and permanent notification drop tracker. I'm guessing most people using this are neurodivurgent it needs to be simplified a bit and keep that in mind with better tools"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really encouraging and makes you feel the progress every step of the way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You don't even get to know what the app is about without paying. So I have no idea if it is worth paying. But I lost about 10 minutes answering stupid questions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app but it can be a bit overwhelming, as there is so much content. It's hard to know where to begin or what to do next."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"At first I liked this app, but once the novelty wore thin it clearly wasn't a good fit for me. It is full of info on what to do and when but not the mental how of doing it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love the idea of this app and was excited for the first day. But now on day 5 I'm getting so annoyed at the double up of notifications. I check off my morning routine and the 30mins later the notification is back again and I'm having to redo it so it will go away... perhaps a bug that needs to be fixed?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Has potential but still not there fully...too many places to click on...utter confusion...i felt there is lesser focus on goal oriented discipline & more on routine/recreational activities which is not bad just not what wud work for me. But all the best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's such a positive app. While I'm only using the free part so far, it is really making me a happier version of myself. It's something I look forward to each morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far motivating. I like the suggestions and prompts to help develop new habits and feel motivated. I had an issue with setting times for things since I have shift work, my schedule and routines are always at different times. But I just saw the option to ""turn off"" the alarm. So yay. I'm still new to the app, will report back once I'm more used to it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can only manage account from website, cannot cancel subscription only pause for a year, tried to cancel before the year ended, thought I had, tried to resolve on website no options to do so. Had another years subscription taken without consent. Very poor integrity on billing and payment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app developer, keep on doing the good work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm not going to pay for something like this üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gamify Adulting! Do you struggle with daily tasks? Do you struggle to remember what to do and when or even whether you have done it. This is a great wee app, not just alarms and reminders, but wee Dopamine hits when you tick something off your list with a flourish of music and praise. Great for keeping on top of things you need to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's wonderful üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad onboarding experience: Does not let me take the trial unless I set up a payment method. Unless you are a unicorn, asking users to commit without experiencing the app first is a big negative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hard to navigate, difficult to setp up goals, very loud annoying sounds for every action, irrelevant prompts and letters"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helping me to stay consistent with my goals and routines! Great app! Restarting 2023 and still enjoying the progress I made from my first time with the app. Really excited for the next steps in my journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been such an amazing help to keep me disciplined"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far. The tones and images are soothing and uplifting. I'm drinking water every day now and eating a healthier breakfast too!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is making me focus on things that are positive and a distraction from what I'm thinking or feeling, the app is easy to use I would recommend it for sure üòä definitely reinforcing good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app has really inspired me to keep to a routine. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hated the app. Canceled the trial. And of course they charged $40 for the ""free trial"" a year later. I've never had a company be so sneaky about that. Customer service 100% doesn't care. Will tell everyone I know and comment on every video recommending this that is app is a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this is such a great app, it's helping me to stay confident!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is perfect for some people but sometimes things are with money .In the wold have people that wants to see something in this app but it is with money and they cant pay it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. The alerts always remind me of the tasks I need to do. It has really helped me settle into a daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! The app has more to explore as I've only been using it for a few days. I find it simple to use and inspirational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too much overpriced for an online journey. For USA might be ok but atleast in India you have be priced accordingly. Having choice of Business or Impact. App like this have to be Impact oriented, business will follow. Peace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful thanks for providing us this amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A fun and aesthetically pleasing way to remind me of the new habits I want to build. So far, it's been customizable and enjoyable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far it's a gentle reminder to do things I forget to do in the morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"True mentor designed with heart emotions and science"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with it. Thanks üåπ‚ù§üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really a good fit for beginners who start fresh , but some features which I really need are premium.. other than that it's a great app to improve yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy the app. It's very encouraging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Bagus, banyak fiturnya,nadanya adem banget,step yg dijelasin juga membantu banget ,walau belum ada yang bahasa Indonesia.Cuma gatau kenapa kadang kadang notifnya ga keluar. Sayang postingan yang udah udah gaisa dihapus"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great job fabulous I am appreciate you because I am good and better person now I don't like your letter from future. are you pranking us"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't describe in words how wonderful the fabulous is ?,it is fabulous, fantastic, amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hi! I have come back to the app and see that some changes were made. It is much better now and it's really effective. The approach is what makes the service different and effective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I don't really know. First it sounded promising, was asking the right questions, but once I saw they were impersonating my future me I was thrown out of the experience. This is some Replika level of social engineering. No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deleted app after a couple of days after free trial but they keep talking money from my account!! Grrr!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app, I have had it for a while now and it has absolutely helped me grow in so many ways"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best. Just follow the instructions and it works really well. Especially for people like me who tend to overthink. Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I have been making new good habits and I like the motivational speeches I get during the day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really great to start a new habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely worth having on my phone.Keep up the great work!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really truly helping me get on track with life. I would recommend paying to unlock the whole thing. The guided sessions for both exercise and other activities are amazing. On top of that, they have very good sleep sound tracks if you like to sleep with noise. The in app schedule is great to establish a good morning routine. Even if you're depressed or having a hard time, this really helps motivate you towards something. One small step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First time use, second time habits Go for it. It's gonna change your life. 100‚ÑÖ I don't say usually much but this is different from other. It's work. What I was looking for is this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying this app. I love the daily and nightly motivations. They're very insightful. I've been using this app for a few days and really look forward to using it each day. üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"New user here! The billing is yearly, is there an option for monthly??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am very satisfied using this app. It's actually helping me. I feel kind of motivated after seeing all the features of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription months ago and have randomly been charged today for a years subscription. I cant find a way to contact you. Please refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really good and I'm fine now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have down graded ap to 1 star as I do not want a company to have access to my credit card details (via Goggle) before they can give me a free trail. If Headspace can give a 10 day trial then the technology exists for all aps to do this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good reminder for daily habits and the sleep monitor is a great feature."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not helpful. Fancy calendar, typical routine recs, drink more water, be grateful, sleep more, etc. I don't need a novel of content to tell me what I already know I need to do. Just not enough content prior to the subscription beg to justify continuing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice focus on cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally in love. Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the app, the navigation is a little off for me and if there was an offline version.. otherwise it's an ingenious app that everyone should have on their phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been beautiful , but I'd love to pay monthly not once off"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent! I tried the app. Only opened it one time before I deleted it. Definitely never signed up for the subscription. And then got an email 2 weeks later saying my subscription payment info needed to be updated because my card declined the payment. I've checked my subscription history, nothing. Not even the free trial, but they tried to charge me $30 I'm keeping an eye on my cc, if a payment goes through, I will contact my bank Update, it charged me... ü§¨"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I'm finally able to structure my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good This app is a life changer I never skip breakfast Exercise everyday Drink water frequently And much more The daily , nightly coaching and motivator are very helpful Love this app Thank you fabulous No add issue Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This actually helped me to get up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app at ALL costs. I have been charged $39.99 3 times since May 3, 2022 simply for clicking on their Free Trial email on April 26, 2022. Fabulous is preparing to charge me a 4th time on May 26th. I contacted them before the trial was over and requested a full refund, but I never heard back from customer service. I have been a caretaker to my sick father and forgot until saw my new bill. I am going to contact my cc company and the BBB next. I could not recommend this app for any reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm having a good time here"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me motivated in friendly,gentle way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why did it have to be made or designed with pyramids? Am suddenly not comfortable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful about premium, cancelation is only possible on web and it's made really really complicated. You have to confirm about 6-8 times. That's kinda malicious, to hide it behind such bad UX"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it so much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant x"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im in love with the app, love the gamification inside it to drive positive change in people. Its a great purpose to work for kiddos to you team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Bossy and requires payment to use after one week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So Helpful....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There's just too much information, buttons, colors, text, etc. I joined the app to make it simpler to keep track of habits but instead it is too confusing. It may work for some but it wasn't for me. I cancelled my subscription within the 7 day trial period but I was still charged the full amount, and the app doesn't even give me the premium subscription anymore despite charging me! Have written to the customer support but no response yet. Disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app toleRn healthy routines for your days."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't cancel. Tried canceling before the premium kicked in. Now im trying to cancel and get a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Without even trying what's exactly is inside the app how anyone can directly make payment, even for a trail you have to fill up payment details. I feel one week should be free without payment details."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many long animations make this app very annoying to use if you want to log something quickly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the nightly meditation, genuinely inspiring content thus far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is getting me more motivated#"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to get some really good habits going!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so good. I really like it. So goodüíûüíûüíûüíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You took a payment from my account without any subscription or autorization from my side. I am left with no money now, because this app just took the all the money from my account. No prior notification, no subscription, no autorization from my side. Please refund my money! I am not even logged into the application, I had a restore to factory settings on my phone and this app reinstalled and took my money with no notice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulously fantastic app. I love it, it simplify the process for me. This is indeed a great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greattttttt ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription and a year later was still charged 54$ without my consent. Customer service is saying refund not allowed as per terms of service. A joke of an app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for those who intend to improve their lives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It doesn't open I didn't know why this happen but this hurt my feelings"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"AMAZING APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am on Day 4 using this app and I am enjoying it so far. I have committed myself to the process and am excited to see the final outcome. One step at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a fun app with good guides. It's just quite expensive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great could do with calendar input for work days/ days off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"If you're looking for an app that comes up with a daily routine, then this isn't the app for you despite the name. It's just another habit tracker with empty ""self care"" tips and honestly $40 is a lot for that. The UI is nice tho."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Challenging and inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've found it really useful to help make subtle changes to gradual progress towards my Health & Self goals :-)"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No comments beats the fact that if you want to create a Change in your life then this is the App for the journey. Fabulous is exceptional üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app, and the fact that they give you a lot of opportunities to earn premium content day by day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was trialling it and the free version keeps asking for me to pay. It takes away from any real experience on the free app. So I deleted it. I now received an email with an invoice attached saying it attempted to take money out when I never even attempted to subscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using Fabulous for 2 weeks now and it is painlessly helping me improve my morning routine and feel more hopeful. Good stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A very good app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Predatory app imo. A few screens to cancel membership and I already struggle with executive disfunction. The app is pretty, sure, but it did not help me achieve any goals. I already uninstalled but I guess I didn't get through enough screens to end my membership. Also heads up that the offers are in US funds."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"1 week in! The app so far has been very useful. The language is motivating and I don't feel shamed at all. I enjoy the audio content to help me start my day with a positive mindset. The app is very easy to use and doesn't bombard me with annoying reminders/prompts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is good. I use it in my daily life. But I would like to ask: please add the possibility to customize the tasks of a routine with the possibility to add a description and sub-tasks! This is very important when building a routine. I need to use the reflections field as a field to add a description of a task and also sub-tasks, this is a workaround. Within each task there should be a field to add a description and subtasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me on focus on my habits so much, with the busy days sometimes we forgot the simple things that makes life happier"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I started using it only a few days ago, but so far, great! I think a tini improvement will be calculating the time of the whole routine. It will defo inspire my anxious brain to admire how much I've done for such a short while so I can boost my motivation to achieve more. Thank you üòä üíì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a very great app, it assist u as u live a healthy life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not useful at all, repetitive and boring. I can't believe I payed for this app!!! What a waste of money!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm not using this but i paid 40$.i didn't know that im subscribe for this..and you cant get the refund..this app is scam.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"What would make this a 4 star app is a widget for tracking habits and routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely and utterly amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not Worth IT they give you 7 days when you subscribe them if you dont Like and you want to Unsubscribe them they Charge you 39.99 and the App is mqny Features but wont help you so is wasting your time not rocomended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only 7 days to test the app is not enough, I deleted it straight and don't want to try if it's not possible to test 2 weeks at least. Furthermore, I don't like the immediate credit card prompting which is quite aggressive. I'm a very fond consumer of paid apps only if they give me time to discover for 30 days, get comfortable, trust it and then offer me to purchase a membership. That would show that you believe so much in your app that you don't need to force a membership immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greatest app ever and absolutely free I salute your team for a great work done Thank you for making me a better person Keep up the good work guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for making plans to relax and have a great time with your previous work and life schedule"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Unable to get a refund! The app gives you the run around and eventually tells you your purchase is not eligible for a refund. I uninstalled the app and they still charged me with no heads up or notification sent to email! Update: thanks for the reply. I did get a full refund after communication with your support team via email. I updated the review score accordingly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. It keeps me on check daily. And I love the consistency of it reminding me of things I need to keep doing. Frm the exercise, the healthy breakfast and the thought that I HV to be grateful for something. It keeps my memory alive. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's changing my life ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've never approached self-care with tools like these. Maybe this is why I'm making progress this time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I truly love this app,it is not only good for someone who needs to learn how to get into good habits,but also a tool one could use in their spiritual journey in this vase cosmos of ours. I 100% recommend this app to anyone who would want to find motivation, want to learn about themselves more, want to improve or even maintain the life they already have,or even just for the fact that they are looking for something different to just explore and experiment with. Well done to the developers.üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you I'm such a new person"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It motivates me to be my best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am really loving how this app encourages small steps to changing habits it feels way less overwhelming and manageable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a good app, my only complain is that there are no many options of habits to be included in my daily routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Abofalle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Prompts to set up morning routine and fill days with what empowers me to be the best version of myself more often."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Horrible, I literally got drink water as routine and after that it kept bugging me for premium subscription. I will give it another try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great service. They gave me a full refund after deciding not to use the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You will love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the beat app to use if you wanna change things in your life. It helps you realize you need to start small steps before you take big ones, kind of like u have to crawl before you can walk. The start may seem like it will take forever to make real change but I have been doing this for a little over the week and I am already noticing changes. I'm sleeping better, I have more focus, and I'm a lot calmer and I don't angry as much. Try it you won't regret it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful & getting alots of empowerments. Thanks ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muitos forte"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Always feel welcome by this app. I'm starting again using it to improve myself. I will update my review again after I follow through everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First it asks lots of personal questions, then requires my email address. And only after that it presents me with the expensive subscription. Can't even continue to the free week without giving payment info. So it is in fact using behavioral science. But just to get me to pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i love it!!! it changed me a lot!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent App. It sure provides alot of positive impact."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Will I be charged? I Uninstalled as soon as I saw it was a paid app. Didn't even click pass the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving the app so far. I'll admit initially the app appeared a little busy in the beginning, but it didn't take long to get a handle on how to navigate through everything. I'm giving the 4 stars because of that. It may be overwhelming to some initially."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app for building habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Holds me accountable and holds my attention with great animations, soothing sounds, and music. It makes me feel like I'm in my own adventure game....because that's pretty much what life is!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love love this app, the only problem I have is that I can't afford the premium and it's such a bummer when I am unable to get access to other features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the Fabulous app. They are very personable and persistent in caring about my self-care, my mentality and my over all well being. I would and do recommend the Fabulous app to anyone and everyone. Thank you Fabulous!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm... Officially in love with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very hard to operate"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stop asking me a ton of questions everytime I come back to the app with no skip option. Then every community is filled with posts from Fabulous app moderators?? I'm scrolling down in a pet lovers community and it's filled with app moderators posting boring stuff like 'describe what your pet did..' or 'what has your pet taught you'. How about you let members post and motivate each other while you stay away? This isn't about you. Most annoying app I've seen in a while"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It may be great, but it is only free for 7 days. I can't buy it, so I left."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app has everything you need for motivation and guides you every step of the way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love how it help me to organize my new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A good app...lot of content. Would be great for someone getting started on habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a big help for me in this tough time in my life, would recommend to anyone who needs a lil extra push to better themselves"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wish they would tell you before installing it that it is not a free app...well for a week it is üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not actually free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"set it all up then tells you that you have to pay a monthly fee to use it üòê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not just an 'Organising' app. It teaches you the 'how to' and helps to make your life richer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst. During signing in they charged the amount without authorization, and their support system is also terrible, even I am not able to convey my problem to anyone who can look into the matter properly. Write now I don't have subscription and I am also charged for the subscription of one year. Fabulous team, Your Bot is not able to solve the problem. Please hire some humans to help us."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have never used an app this GOOD. Downloading this app, I was hoping, ""you better fix my life, you're a university product."" And thus far, with the Pro version, my life is getting back together! I've picked up 10 habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very artistic in app design which I can appreciate as an artist, I also love the dreamscape idea. However, for me personally, I think there's just too much going on and it may be related to my neurodivergency. I've found another app that is similar but is more simplistic and zen. Thank you for providing me a free trial though! I do recommend this app to those interested in getting a life coach or wishing to improve their habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the way Fabulous provides insight into how to build new habits, and make them easier when starting. The morning and evening routines are great. I especially like the coach who gives you things to contemplate about, sometimes while you're falling asleep which is lovely. I think you could provided a little more detail about the psychological processes which effect habit formation (which is why you built the way you did), this kind of knowledge can be really empowering."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"be careful with the payment of the premium version, sometimes Google play doesn't include this app in the payments, which means you have to go to website to cancel your premium, and if you're unlucky like me and you realized it after they charged you, say goodbye to your money cause they're not gonna refund it to you, no matter how many emails you sent even if you were charged 10 mins ago they will not reply to your emails, instead they'll bombard you with 30 day premium pass emails,what a shame"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent and misleading. The so called 7 day free trial costs ¬£56.99 and is taken before you even get a chance to activate the account. Trying to talk to someone to get a refund is impossible and they don't reply to emails or tickets raised on the website. Absolutely disgusting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My personal life coach is awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is cool but improve your life depends 99% of you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Me gusta mucho pero la versi√≥n en espa√±ol est√° muy limitada a comparasi√≥n con la versi√≥n en ingl√©s. Recomiendo que la usen en ingl√©s si pueden."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You don't give a warning or a reminder before the free trial expires. Now you've taken my feeding money for the next few weeks and I have to start begging my extended family.üò† I want a refund!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app is great bcause it supplies a good non premium version 10/10 it helps me with small habits and beckming more reliable on myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, really enjoy the experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The amount of personal data you want just to open the app, including my email, is unacceptable. This is nothing but data harvesting. Get lost!!! Uninstalled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing if you put in your mind to keep going with routines and develop healthy habits ! It's the best app concerning Planning and Routines implementation. üëè."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is awesome but this app require money. I know you guys also have to earn money but if u make this app free then u will get more promotions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app and I waited about 10 min for it to load and even then it still won't load so it just stays at the home screen. I can't even get into the app it's so annoying. It looks like it would be a good app if I could get into it. I'm very disapointed with not being able to use this app at all and I ended up deleting it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Super cute but it doesn't grab my attention enough to remember to mark my stuff. I'm going to keep trying bc I love the concept and I just have to get into the habit more üòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really good, it is one of the best productivity apps. Highly recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I paid for the subscription & I'm loving everything so far! I especially like that it gives you a warning if you're selecting too many things so you don't try to do too much, too fast & subsequently set yourself up to fail after getting overwhelmed; which is exactly what I do & is exactly why I need this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app for morning routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app..ü•∞ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. Worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really Obnoxious"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with this app so far. I love the step-by-step approach. Every 3 days after you complete your task you get to pick another until you build a good morning routine. Then you get to add afternoon and bedtime routines. It was a tad bit confusing at first, but keep at it and soon you'll see how effortless it all really is. Thank you so so much! I'm recommending this to anybody I know that needs help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helps me build new habits üëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most incredible app I've ever seen, it's like a private coach in ur pocket"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is really good and the designs are great. There's not really much problems except that there's a lot of elements hidden behind Premium (having to pay). For example, basic stuff like mood tracking and podcasts are blocked if you don't pay. This app is good for people who are eager to pay and/or actually develop good habits. If you don't want to pay, I suggest Loop or Microsoft To Do List for task-keeping."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so good.It changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the flow of this app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD - THEY WILL SCAM YOU I cancelled my subscription within three days of using the app. My dumbself gave them my GooglePay details and I suffered because they charged me even after cancellation. I double checked and raised multiple tickets but they haven't responded. Use at your own risk. So much for improving my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it and I feel like my life is changing one habit at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Goat"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app, but I'd like the option to turn off the requests to share my progress, and other notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far pretty good app but it'd be so much better If you could put a widget on your home screen instead of just the app. Widgets are more viable and attention catching!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I rate this app a full 5 stars, it works on and offline, it's an amazing app i recommend everyone to download it and the play store or app store should put it on everyone's recommendation list"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is great i like the colors and the stories it makes me want to come back everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"im only on day 5 but im noticing small changes like more motivation to take care of myself and tons more self congratulations than i had before. awesome way to navigate behavioral changes. thank u guys!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Okiy okey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good but will see after a couple months"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"pay or nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Snooze to specific time is the most desired feature this *GREAT APP* has me wishing for. My days are not predictable enough to always know when a reminder really fits. As an Explorer personality type (see the book ""Why Him Why Her""), it would be excellent to choose/snooze to a different time, just for today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is really really amazing. But if it was free app then it was too good. I mean I am not telling to make this app completely free but atleast some features should be free. We can't use this app for lifetime. Overall this app is the best. And those who can afford go for its subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good motivation to form new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel like I have an online coach to guide and build me up with the daily inspirational messages pulling from famous philosopers past and present. Even though I also get multiple reminders per day, I'm never bothered (as I usually am). Overall, so glad I found Fabulous and the changes are happening one step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that you don't feel pushed but encouraged. My favourite part is the coach:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring and motivating app to help u on ur to do list just incase ur the type of person who is not that organize about things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Using after all these years. And still get a lot out of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this aap is Haven I think every person have to use this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is teaching me to take small sustainable steps towards my goals. I'm excited about my future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I tried upgrading but it's not working. How do I get the premium version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the colors (reminds me of Lisa Frak) and the bells and reminders are not annoying. This is all important for my ND brain. So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"F√°cil, simples e realmente eficaz. Rastreio meus h√°bitos di√°rios nele. O app √© √∫til e extremamente bonito. Nenhuma ressalva ü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is changing my life! I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I woke up today and saw you guys taking money from my PAYPAL account WITHOUT MY CONSENT! I applied for the premium membership that was FREE for a few days/ you guys said you will remind me by the end of the period, and YOU DIDN'T. I FEEL ROBBED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO GET MY MONEY BACK, I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT MONEY AND IT'S GONE. PLEASE FIX THIS. UNTIL THEN I'M GIVING U 1 STAR. reply: I HATE THIS APP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT GUYS. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really lovely app, irmakrs me feel empower again!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its slowing down and crashing on my samsung A51"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app that prompts you to be a better version of yourself. It's a great way to change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps me keep up with my tasks. Like setting a foundation. I enjoy the workouts and meditations it provides."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best apps ever made. Easy to use, with a routine planner whose you can choose or create your tasks to achieve an goal. Every week they suggest you the best routines they created to fix your problem or to change your behavior. Of course, they make your life better! Another thing I want to eulogize it is that everyday they post a lesson with something to make a reflection and sometimes with loveable poems. Thank you, Fabulous app team! God bless you richly for your work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really love the fabulous app. And it shows you some things for your morning routine. One thing I'm upset about is it's only free for 7 days. But overall I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A wonderful habit tracker. Great motivation and feel good feedback."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty awesome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I feel it's not user friendly.. It has subscription plan which get start automatically"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been such a brilliant app so far. It definitely helps with getting you thinking about things that need changing or tweeking but in a way that's not overwhelming. Definitely worth a try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My New supporter"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app, it really helps a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A lot of ""coaching"" that can be guilt-tripping. A lot of emphasis on creating a ""new me"" without taking into account that we might just be looking for ways to maintain a level of functioning that we already put a tremendous effort into achieving. Unfortunate that a lot of New Age / self-development junk science is mixed with what are evidence-based CBT technics and knowledge. Also the app is not that easy to navigate and find the info, like the guides (which I find great)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app to track daily routine. Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A pretty app, but the routines are too verbose and long. I want a quick reminder and just that not some long story that I have to watch until the end."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app for adopting new and good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have tried many apps to self improved and this is the most suit and the longest used apps so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Muito complexo."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its going good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a pain to cancel your subscription. You are required to go through the website and they make it annoying to do so. This app feels cluttered and busy. Also, while it is advertised to help one build habits, it exclusively can track daily habits. There is no choice to do varied frequency (e.g. only weekdays or three days per week). If you just want to track progress on habits, do not use this app. There are too many distractions and fluff to make it useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Garbage app and functionality. Too many unskippable videos. Too much waste of time, and if you delete it and reinstall it (to give it a second chance) it forces you to go through the entire test without checking if you have an account first. I really regret buying the full version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! The focus on small changes makes this enjoyable and less overwhelming than most apps. I actually look forward to knocking out the tasks everyday. Fast forward to 2023. I stopped using the app because life got in the way. But I restarted and am so glad I did. I forgot how peaceful this app makes me feel. How it takes away the stress of trying to do all the things, all the time. Small changes lead to big changes and a bigger life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Dej√© de ocupar la app porque ya no la necesitaba. Han pasado ya sus 2 o 3 meses desde que cancel√© la subscripci√≥n gratis y me siguen llegando facturas de la app, revis√© en google play y no tengo suscripciones activas. DEJEN DE COBRARME POR DIOS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many click and reminders. Make a sane person go to mental OCD. The only positives are the nice animations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice ui"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It'd be cool if something I've been doing every day for my entire life wasn't my first 3 day long goal üôÉ please make it possible to change things to actually make it so it might help you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I used the free version for about 2 weeks. The Fabulous app is colorful and visually interesting, with levels and stories and coaching along the way. I want to bring ease and clarity into my daily practices, so the emphasis on challenges, extras, upgrades, and messages of ""this will be SO DIFFICULT, but you can do it!"" is not compatible. I switched to Todoist for a clean, distraction-free interface (relief for my ADHD) and positive message popups when I take care of what I intended to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a coaching plan when I signed up for a trial on top of the trial amount. There was never an email confirmation of it, it just showed up as a $90+ charge and they won't refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had this app for a little while in early 2022 and then cancelled it as it wasn't for me. In 2023 despite canceling they charged me the 40 dollar fee again. I had removed my information and to my knowledge didn't have an active subscription. Support refunded me and i thought that was that. Wrong. This month they charged me the 40 dollars again. This should not have happened. Clearly they are misusing customer data as I was told everything was cancelled before. Avoid or they'll steal your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This ap is amazing in this app ""we can set the goals and we just try to achieve them"". After achieving your goals, you would feel so proud of yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to keep track of your progress. When you see your accomplishments it makes you to stride for more!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes me accountable and really has helped me achieve small goals and soon bigger ones!! Thanks, Fabulous!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is really great its really helping me grow in places where i never thought i would be able to i highly recommend it Although i think the notifications should be modified"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the premium subscription in November of last year and was just charged for premium. I was directed to an auto chat for refund request. Clicked ""charged for premium after canceling subscription"". I was told i was not eligible for a refund. Others had same experience with response ""go to site and click contact us and explain in detail"", this takes you back to same automatic chat with no place to ""describe in detail"" only predetermined responses. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app always shows new goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying using this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This program eases you into reaching your goals. It provides great tools for overcoming yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I found my motivator, I have never felt that I could be this adamant to create good habits. I have had more energy and a clear mind in these pass 5 days then I ever have in the pass 10yrs without force. I am willing to continue using Fabulous to see what other good I can do. Easy to use, on time to remind you, definitely a great app to maneuver, to understand and to work with. Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled my account and a few months later still charged. I'd never use this app again. It's so obnoxiously loud so I would never want to open around people. Not worth the money!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was discontented at first, because I was wrongly charged for a whole year of subscription when I only tried the 7days. I submitted a complaint they replied few hours later. But took 3 days to process everything. Anyway, I appreciate the action that you have taken, for these I'll change my review. The app was good and understandable to use but please fix the bug in your system."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been helpful, and I have actually gained new healthy habits after about a week and half use. Starting with the foundation is the easy way to go."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I great way to change your lifestyle and track it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Auxh a beautifully built app to help control bad habits. I got out of rehab in March and need to reevaluate my behaviors and routines and this app DEFINITELY is a beautiful tool for that!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The visuals background score & every little detaikings feels quite satisfying ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not enjoy this app at all and they won't give my money back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I was really struggling with my mental health. I wanted to change somehow. I was really hesitant & getting the app truly was out of just desperately wanting to feel better. I can honestly say it helped me in so many ways. Highly recommend this as it has helped change my mindset! It doesn't work instantly, if you put in the effort it will in time! Only thing I'd suggest is making it so you can check off items late and not lose progress if i forgot to on a busy day but I've completed the task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is what I needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. Something I actually want to keep up with. Makes me feel, differently about myself and makes me, want more for myself. I love love love this app and will recommend. Lol!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way back when this app first started, over 10 years ago now, it was great! It was a nice habit tracking app with behavior insights and encouragement. But they've just kept adding so many different features and trying to make it every app at once, making it hard to use, and pressuring you into premium. Now, even with premium, it's annoying, slow, and difficult to use, and it's trying to be everything and is barely a habit tracker anymore. Old versions are good for habit tracking, but not this one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it, I have found it in the right time I was really needing this, thanks and hope you can always make changes and improvements in the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply Love it ...got to improve myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"amazong and useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware! Charged me for a year for the app that doesn't work and then refused to refund. The app didn't work as advertised and annoyed me with reminders for the items I've already marked as done. I wasn't able to actually use it even for one day, but forgot to cancel before the end of the extremely short trial period. My request for refund was then denied by Google Play. Make sure to uninstall it right away if this piece of work doesn't work for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a wonderful app that holds me accountable. It is starting me in bite-sized tasks. So far, so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me more than counseling for the past 10 years combined with a CBT and DBT app I use as well it is truly a fabulous at in worth the price for premium it genuinely changed me when I lose on my journey before and now I'm starting over because I know the results I will see"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has become one of my favorite apps. So helpful. Thank you so much for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"High quality really helpful. It helps you get in better condition in any situation or problems I tried the first week and I already feel better I highly recommend this if you're looking to be more productive,less stress, deal with muti problems and getting sleep. It keeps tracks of each step and improves, five star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm autistic and ADHD. I have a real issue with a lot of apps I've tried to build habits with in the past. I generally don't use them for long. This one, I'm finding there's less overwhelm of planning well into the future and the goals are tiny steps that I feel I can do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription almost a year ago because this app is a waste of life, and you have stolen money from me. I'm literally poorer for trusting these people. We're all better off having a kip on the train tracks than giving money or time to these dogs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The cancelation of subscription is super hard. You subscribe, you get email to confirm, even if you do not confirm subscription at the end of free period you will be charged with a fee. Thou on app there is no subscription. And no easy way to roll out of the plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great application to have for making your life Fabulous. Loving the stories and the foundation thing for great success."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only just started using this app, but it is already making such a huge difference and keeping me motivated. The playable clips are so insightful and thought provoking. Highly recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for such an amazing app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has helped me so much and it's only been 6 days of course you have to put a conscious effort to get up and get started but this is a really good motivator just remember to start small don't push yourself too much (:"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Marvelous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me build better habits, create routines, look inward and grow to find my purpose, and motivate me daily. Very beneficial for my mental health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Highly disrespectful to our beliefs picturing a muslim girl sitting next to a guy in Ramadan meditating or whatever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me since yesterday I downloaded it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't want 7 days + 40‚Ç¨ monthly registration, I also don't want 30 days + 40‚Ç¨ registration. The newsletter with commercial offers I did not register to are unclear. When your app proposed me the registration I did not click on anythibg but then your communication is all not clear and anxious. Please remove everything about me from your database."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to follow nd make changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceling Subscription, trying to cancel my subscription before the free trial period ends but it won't let me. Started before the necessary 24 hours and their is no way to cancel. It doesn't even show I have a subscription but I have the trial period. What do I do? Website says I must go through play store. But doesn't show in play store. Now they are going to wrongly charge me. Please fix"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled this app because it wS not working for me and they billed me anyway. Cannot figure out how to get a refund and I'm mad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too complexity for even easy reminder. Not a first efficient calculated journey based on lifestyle of user. Too expensive with no cash back if stop it the same day and no increase journey or functionality if pay. A lot of things talked, even opening the push notification, without set day or time for that or meditation reading."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good I really like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app. I would love to add my own habits or customise some things. But it's good. Still starting the journey and enjoying ticking off my healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to keep track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app First collects your all information then asks for subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am enjoy aa lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beyond my expectations!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everyone BEWARE! You needed both my phones pin number and my fingerprint to proceed. Shame on you! When I was doing the intake survey my phone went blank, causing me to use my pin number twice to sign in. Then you wanted my finger print. All while you were collecting my personal information. I changed my pin btw."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've just been billed for another year despite cancelling a while back. Listed as ""Inactive"" in my Google account - expired 30th Jan 2021. Downloaded app again to try and cancel and was asked for payment details as if I was a new customer. Please contact me to arrange a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Downloaded and set up, all seemed fine then immediately saw that one of the pre set up goals was fasting. As someone recovering from an ED this was an immediate no and uninstall. Rest of the app seemed nice but if that sort of thing is pre set up for new users that's an immediate no for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app but I wish it had more things unlocked without getting premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved the app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So, fabulous has gone beyond my expectations, and this app is so good that it helped me upgrade my grades since I am a student. It increased my retention of knowledge while on top of your daily goals ‚ú®Ô∏è. I also love the chill music included in the 14-day study skills challenge. ‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing routine tool I will recommend it to my Netizen community to aid them have a Daily Routine for maximum productivity in their lives"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app and the thing you don't even need to purchase it is awesome...loving it so far.!!!ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this! I wanted to try this last year but I am too young. Now that I am 16 years old, I can finally use this. This app gave me a powerful and beautiful first impression. I had huge spikes of motivation to change my life. I really wanted a Routine Planner and this is the best one I've ever tried. I am using the free version and it already has many features. You should try this too! Highly recommended to everyone. Keep up the good work!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very supportive and non judgmental."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Much needed, amazing!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app could be great if it had a distraction free mode or something. All of the extra affirmations and content takes away from the app, at least for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Started out well. I have the paid version. Then I switched phones and carriers, and now I can't get back to my profile. It continues to start me at the quiz. I researched how to troubleshoot and walked through those steps. Did not work. I reach out to customer service, who tells me to follow those same steps I already did. All of the steps they have directed me to do have not work. For a person who came to the app to improve my inability to follow through...better troubleshooting is needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tout simplement parfaite, j'esp√®re que je ne vais pas devoir payer pour la suite. Cette application m'aide beaucoup √† me sentir mieux Update 1 an apr√®s : J'aime toujours autant cette application, elle t'aide √† devenir meilleure et √† avoir de bonnes habitudes. Toi aussi qui lit √ßa, improve yourself !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly didn't know what it will be like but I'm so glad I picked this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just having a problem putting in my card but otherwise great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid all service shouldn't be at free app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nicely designed app, very limited functionality in free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"life changing app. must try for everyone struggling in their life with their goals, schedules or motivation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a science-based, realistic life-changer. I've failed in the past because I didn't want to take it as slowly as the app encourages you to, but that's the only way I've made lasting changes; by not overwhelming myself. Do it and you'll love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's actually helping me to develop healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not a 100% what I thought I was looking for, but this focuses on the mechanics and self- realizations in your typical habits. Definitely see how this will help break some bad habits I've picked up over the years. So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfect app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Genius. Whether you're gifted with neurodivergence or just need help gaining control over the chaos that can come from daily life, this app is a gift from the universe. The creators have broken down constructing daily routines into manageable, bite-sized pieces which largely reduces the initiation effort to complete the tasks. Many of us struggle with executive dysfunction especially as it relates to creating a system or routine that is vital to managing the adverse symptoms of ADHD/Autism."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Corporate self help app that's trying to pose as scientific evidence-based. And then making you read and 'pledge' to some cheesy oath right before asking you to sign up to a direct debit? That bit made me laugh."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE. you have to go thru hoops to cancel, and can only do so on their website. I canceled during the trial via Google like all other apps have you do. Even after that it still charged me $40 and i have no way to recoup that, and I am stuck paying for an app I don't like or use. It even said my susbscription was canceled unless i go on the website, not app. Very tricky"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forgot to cancel the free trial as I deleted the app and didnt want to use the app anymore and was denied a refund. I contacted support as instructed and was turned away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm starting but I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic, have been using it for years now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only just started using it but it's really keeping me on track to drink more and begin a little exercise"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an awesome habit forming app and it always reminds me whenever I miss the task to do it i like this app coz it has a great community section in which you can see people growing and writing their journey with the app that's truly inspires."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used 3 apps just like this, but this is by far the greatest one that I've come across. very simple to follow yet the learnings and growth is exceptional."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app I've used in my life. It is so helpful,it helps me get so many good habits and I would suggest it to anyone who wants make their life better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing. Thanks to the developers for creating such a life changing app. I'd recommend to everyone. Straight forward and user-friendly UI"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app, though I wish we can add more habits without paying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic good support system if you are looking to make positive changes in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self help and routine formation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I've ever used. I've felt myself and freedom already and I'm still only just beginning üôÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Editing to 5 stars, because I was showed the possibility to mark previous days as complete, when i forgot to. Great app. Inspiring and motivating. Takes all the guilt away while still motivating you to continue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A bit to many notifications throughout the day but otherwise I LOVE this app. I haven't been super consistent but I am getting better and it's making me feel so positive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So, after paying for an annual subscription back in March (2022) they decided to remove any track of my subscription and want me to pay for a full year again now (June). They don't reply. To be honest, I installed this app because I'm feeling down and I don't appreciate them giving me such a bitter experience. Update: After months of no response, they fixed the issue but blamed it on me. Also, they changed the language of the app to Spanish and that makes you miss tons of meditations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Satisfying and good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I found it very useful because it is like a journey and is very graphic, helping me to come back to the app and discover what new thing is here. I only used a 7-day free trial, and the pro paid it seems too much for its purpose. I don't understand why they have exorbitant prices for a simple app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this! Great reminders to live a healthy lifestyle. Male each goal a normal part of the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent motivational tool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best productivity app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really helping me organize my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ith showed me me the way of life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving Fabulous so far! The reminders are a HUGE help!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app so farü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got tired of answering questions without ever getting into the app and just deleted it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've really been liking the app...it's helped me become more productive. I also miss the daily stories of the Fabulous guy...I also used to look forward to seeing it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Overall great experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Currently conflicting with updated OS, and can't press everything when it's drawing over apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making me more positive day by day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Doesn't overwhelm you with good habits all at once. Daily coaching is really motivating and helpful. Guided exercises are amazing for when I don't have time for the gym. Glad I paid for premium, well worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've been using it for a short while now but I'm starting to see a difference in my daily habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Used to be 5 stars until the latest update (v3.76) - now the App's interface and the guided activities are suddenly in German despite my device being set to English. This has never happened with previous versions of the app. Following the steps described in the help article to change the language didn't work either. Would appreciate if there was an in-app toggle to choose content language - I paid for premium mostly because of all the guided activities and now they don't work for me anymore :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really keeps me on track and i love the motivanioal videos and messages they share with me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the accountability and the reminder."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it, keeps me on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still working my way around the app, hoping I can stick at it, if there was a way to connect it to my fitbit app that would be the bomb digerty üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Costs like 40$ a year. You do realize you'll make more money with a free tier. I'm not paying for something right out of the gate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is sooo helpful and helped me in my daily life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app was a scam I try to use the free trial and put my account then a few days I stop using it so I delete after a month I was just notifies that my account has payed this fabulous app with an amount of 2,050 pesos for a premium it says so I installed it again but it start all over again and the payment that they get I didn't receive any and I do request of refund there is no update"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app. Love that there's no irritating ads the entire time. So far, I'm actually making progress with the help of Fabulous, whereas other apps bore me quickly. Good job guys ü©∑"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encouraging and really easy to use. Excellent ui/ux"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want to make a change, then should use this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Notifications are way too annoying!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I really enjoyed this and it was very helpful in the beginning. The further in you go on the journeys it becomes very obvious they only reference, quote and relate to toxic, white, men, some are even openly racist or were slave owners. I found it also very frustrating that the studies quoted for the programs were often only conducted on men and were rarely peer reviewed. I think they could make this a very good app with a more diverse team and mindset moving forward."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using this for a couple of days, but it seems to be working. Starts easy, setting routines and building motivation. Reserving 5 stars for after I've been using it longer and can see more progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous Daily Rou... Rate this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very predatory app, do not use unless you want to be scammed. It charged my card even though I have cancelled my subscription via G Playstore more than a year ago. No email warning whatsoever and no email notification that I was being charged. Apparently I need to cancel via the app but this was not mentioned before. I wrote in email with proof of my cancellation and they say they only reply refunds via bot. Then the bot say you can only get refund if you were charged within 48 hrs. Predatory."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app it's just the best option to build a positive habit it helped me a lot and I recommend it to you guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There is much better habit apps out there. I regret buying the Premium after 7 days to continue using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the most adorable app which makes me to do everything üòçand makes me insanely productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed the app for the first time back in 2015 , I was glad to reinstall it and see how it changed. Until I saw ""non binary"" in gender options ! I am not going to be a part of that ! ‚ùåÔ∏è‚ùåÔ∏è‚ùåÔ∏è‚ùåÔ∏è ŸÑÿß ÿ®ÿßÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÅŸäŸÉŸÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has actually translated to improvements in important areas of my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great concept, but... It's buggy on my s22 ultra. The notifications to complete my routine keeps popping up again as soon as it's competed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible! I am adventuring into Fabulous World! I am turning my best version ‚ò∫Ô∏è. This app offers all I need to be a great adventurer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"More features could be free, but the app is perfect otherwise!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's an enjoyable app. Nicely laid out and some good advice, however the cost is quite a lot, I would prefer a pay monthly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Habit tracking done in the background while coaching is front and center. Links to daily coaching sessions up to know would open to the Fabulous website. Now they open to the sessions. Tapping Circles notifications does not open the app; I have to open the app and go to Circles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice thank you so much ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app, if you really have the will to follow it will slowly and steadly start changing you habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very systematic and encouraging Make u motivated and disciplined"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth the 40 bucks for one year cheaper than various therapies and alternatives. I think it's engaging and fun and there are different challenges and a community forum. I looked at the free trial but that was just a teaser the premium $40 a year gives you all access and then it becomes worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app and plan to keep premium when my trial expires. The only thing I don't like is the Circles feature. It just appeared on the app for me today, and it won't let me leave all of the Circles. That feels a bit too social media for me, which is something I'm trying to avoid through the app in the first place."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly enjoying this app. Love the encouragement, the tracking, the reminders. It helps get me moving in a positive direction every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app if you want to change your life they have good routin plan cotching and many more thing we can also join our favorite Circles i love this app man just try you will change your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Four days in testing the free version. I instantly feel Cheerful, at Peace, and Encouraged upon opening the morning routine reminder. The app is well designed and well thought out for the ADHD mind, down to its colorful and playful appearance. After I perform the new habit I'm developing for that day, it always changes my mood to happy and puts a smile on my face. That's because I feel safe, supported, and like I'm slowly regaining control over my life. BRAVO üëè!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very hard to contact. I cancelled my membership but the money has been taken out this year again. I can't find the option to sign i so that I can cancel it again. üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great app.... Helps me a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a great app. Almost our best friend. üòÖüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Gives you daily motivation and helps you build habits through gamification and storytelling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for everything, thanks..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's been great so far. I've been making little but progressive changes in my life. Thanks to the fabulous team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great one so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it alot. A little too detailed, in the sense that I wish there was an option to pick specific goals for my routine, instead of having free-reign for myself. Not enough options for an app where I am looking for habit-structure. For each routine, the notification will never go away, so I have to manually turn off ""persisting notifications"". As an annual premium member, it seems like there would be a better UI. Still a great app for building habits, though, helps out alot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"All encompassing for so many aspects of ur life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really a good app for good habit mastering."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing new part of my life everyday!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice and works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the coaching audios, I hope there where more. It's a good app overall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App never worked even on the free trial. I was charged the amount for the yearly plan. Now ive paid for an app that doesn't work and the developers won't issue a refund. Do yourself a favor and move to another app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only 7 days for a 'life changing' trial and you have to give your card details. I don't think so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing and encourages healthy new habits with gentle reminders and encouragement!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfecto"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"By far the best app. It's very user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is amazing‚ù£Ô∏è It actually helping me to be healthy and mentally inclined‚ù£Ô∏è I already recommended others to use this app‚ù£Ô∏è Thank you guys for this amazing app‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making me relieved and i enjoy using the app... Especially the sounds used give us a sense of pleasure for achieving more frm the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am not sure but I feel that I have been scammed. I was charged with the premium membership inspite of cancellation of subscription and I am unable to access the premium features as well. This is just unacceptable and I don't know what to do. I hope the developers respond to my query as I have no other way to reach out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the structured freedome of this app its a great cheerleader and very forgiving. It has standard options for goal, challenges and meditations also gives the freedom to create your own/modify what's given. I have played around on it enough to know that for a computer this app makes a pretty good accountability partner I have found this helpful right now because I am learning to trust myself and be my own accountability partner so this is perfect. It's me and mirrored BF version me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's super great üòáüëçüèªüëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app, have managed to develop some new habits. The story lines are a bit too long for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Still 1/5 but would also just like to add When has FREE trial ever meant pay ¬£1?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me without even downloading the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this is a very good app. it helps to incorporate habits at a realistic rythme and keeps keeps tack of each. The daily coaching sessions are very insightful. This app has improved a lot! Thank you so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very polished experience, it feels game-like."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had no problems with it yet so i like it,when u put a reminder on then the reminder is reminderüò≠üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app but the premium plan is a little expensive. I wish more features were accessible in free version. However still it's a great app to start good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's OK constantly asking for money though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. There is still some clunkiness to the app. Also please fix the audio clips. There are a lot that get cut off a word or half a word before the end. That definitely doesn't help with anxiety."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had me all excited, all interested in it, until it asked me to pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really appreciate it that it will make me a good virsion of my lifestyle thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super useful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Reminds me to do my tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps create habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"pretty good so far, very gentle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"While I was using it, the app was fine. I have since canceled my subscription (or so, I thought) and have not used the app in over a year. I have also uninstalled the app after making sure my subscription would no longer charge me $35.99. I just checked my bank account to see that I have been charged again for this app. It seems nearly impossible to cancel or avoid paying once you start. I also can not find any helpful form of customer service to ensure that my account is canceled or removed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the morning rituals! I also like the positive reinforcement and encouragement! Those little things make me feel accomplished. Update: Back at it 3/2023 I find that I am getting on autopilot and annoyed with the requirement to check things off my list. I still enjoy the positive messages and support groups."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really powerful and beautiful app so far, it feels personal. I'm really excited to see where the journey goes. Update: nearly six years later, I rejoined and I love it even more. It wasn't the app that made me unsubscribe, but myself and I'm in a way better place. It's helping me so much every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't use it enough, too distracted, not really ony phone often. But it seems like a very positive app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Wish it is free tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been good, so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!!! I got the subscription and is working for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Helped me to improve my mental and emotional health. The UI is beautiful, I love the sounds and it's very easy and enjoyable to use. My favourite part is the Daily Coaching, it always sparks my positivity in the morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have sever ADHD and get the infamous "" ADHD paralysis"". I've tried several apps to help me to get a routine and motivate me. So far, i'm a few days in and I'm loving it! The 10 minute tidying up is really helping to stay on top of chores. Fabulous is definitely staying and I'm happily paying the year subscription. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fill out all the questions then have to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the inspirational and motivational reads. Keeping to a routine is helping to build healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I liked the app. so much. It helps a lot with focusing on the most important side of our life, from where we must start in order to create our dream life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too costly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great story and it can be a motivation for you. I quit social media and feel happy when focusing on myself more. Thank Fabulous to be part of my journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app, with good inspiration and good habit stacking process. I also do like the daily 'coaching' talk, they're quite cliche but all true stuff. It's a good way to help you finally start building good habits. The price is just a bit too much, but for me it's been a cool investment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it. Again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to walk the path"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"O he is my like friend but i dont undertant but i give you 5 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm proud of you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, it is very good, and I am enjoying my journey to better health and a better me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm feeling good with this appüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't download im being charged monthly although I canceled my subscriptions and for some reason I can't reach anyone to talk too FRAUDDDDDDDDDD don't put your card or personal information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Paying for full access is worth it. And to prove I'm not a bot I'm gonna say stuff a bot would never say. Elephant booty. Sushi cupboard. A car made out of the concept of broken dreams. Japanese pencils in Namibian fields. The number 67."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Overall a very good app but the payments for premium version are too much request to decrease more please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Free version is limited"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this. I'm only a few days in but am noticing how much it's helping me feel as if I'm have a productive and efficient day filled with purpose. It's also been a big help with my ADD to know when it's time to slow down and reflect to reconnect. Yep I'm a fan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app quite a bit so far. Also, you don't have to purchase anything. When I was setting it up and it asked for my card info for free trial, I just backed spaced to where that started and was able to start the app without entering any of that information. Very easy to use so far as well. I haven't dealt with any ads yet. I honestly like it enough I might upgrade to premium in the future. Only setback, so far, is that my phone is compatible for the updated version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Can app designers please make Write Your To Do list routine task into a form that allows you to check off completed items on each To Do item and carry over unfinished To Dos to the next day?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to give it a full stars, but I'm partially deaf, it hard to listen, it would be better with coach's voice with subtitles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Making a big deal out of nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App should make an option where we can mark the habit we have done but forgot to mark otherwise everything is to me for now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app I'll have to try it . it looks like a really good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app. I've been tracking my habits for weeks now and I've completed a challenge as well. I've established a morning routine and a night routine plus a workday morning routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm very satisfied with the apps, made me feel there is someone really care bout me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it and it helps me a lot but I miss the daily animations of the character on his journey through the mountains. It might sound silly but it was something to look forward to everyday and just added more to the experience. I used the app for a few months a year ago. At that time the animations only happened for about 2 weeks and then suddenly stopped. Maybe a glitch? Anyways I have recently started using the app again and there have been no daily animations since I started back up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love that the app is helping me create good habits by reminding me to do them daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't use this every day, with that being said the days that I do seem to be better. I know that this app is all about routine however even just the motivational words in the daily coaching are so inspiring that I wish I used it more frequently."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"muy buena aplicaci√≥n, realmente te ayuda a crear habitos y mejorar tu vida. great app, so helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the way Fabulous is making building new habits enjoyable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If it's so fabulous, why didn't it work, and why did I delete it?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. It helps me develop a new character which I didn't know I had it in me. Great work dpne by the team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has been so instrumental in helping me become the better me with philosophy, tips & tools."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well made app that encourages and helps you in making changes and developing good habits. Lovely and colourful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nope. Not giving you my email. And considering the automated response I stand by my initial one star opinion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't used this app for long in fact it's only been a little over a week since I started using it but so far, it's great. I think my favorite part is the letters I get at the start of a new habit and the little story I get for completing my daily habits, they really help motivate me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am seriously a better, happier, healthier and more productive human ever since I started using Fabulous. It doesn't ask for a major overhaul right away, but rather does it in small steps. And if you slip one day, it doesn't punish you, but just encourages you to get back to it. Perfect for anybody looking to make their life better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just started using the app 4 days ago. The experience has been a positive one to his far. It's very motivating. Update: I am still impressed with the app. However, I am disappointed with the purchase process & customer service. The app was cancelled twice due to payment problems. I was unable to get in touch with anyone to discuss the issue and now I have two charges of $39. Customer service is not helpful or available."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful reminders and daily coaching"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It was a great app and I loved it, just that I do t like the fact that there's a premium feature that requires a payment because I feel that it ruins the whole wellbeiing purpose, but otherwise it was great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Calming, optimistic, and amusing. It really helps me forming and be consistent with my habits ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Genial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is helping me get a little better every day: I really like the way it's attached to your pace, and offers educational new challenges that you're free to take on. The daily routines that are tied to the time of day and that you can customize based on your goals are really helpful. Some of the items may seem really tiny or even mundane, but they really get you on your way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"My billing plan isn't working I don't know if it's from you ir my service provide so I haven't been able to upgrade to premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's amazing, it's definitely helped to set very small yet clear and important goals one at a time and build up to a good morning so far. I've tried many apps so far, and this is the best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They don't charge to download the app. They want a subscription though ... But hey you get a free week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helps me keep important things in the fire front."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoyed adding great habits slowly, and successfully without pressure or irritation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thank u for developing this app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is supposed to help you make a routine but all it does is be ridiculously annoying asking me to drink water and eat breakfast at 5:46 pm even though I already did and told it so 3 times today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I tried the free version for 10 days as well as a 10 visit trial at my local gym. This seemed pricey until I was told how much gym membership was. This app works great for me and didn't seem so bad in price after all!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm changing. That's a fact. Highly recommended to create good habits and feel good about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using Fabulous for about 1.5 months now, and my life has definitely changed for the better. Through gradually introduced habits, I have my morning, afternoon and evening rituals that serve as stable points in my day. I feel much less lost, much less overwhelmed by things to do and plans to make. I have a better grasp on where I am and where I am going. I do recommend the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started using it, but I see how it can be a big help in setting small attainable goals and building confidence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too confusing. 7 days was not enough time to interact with the interface. Too much going on. I paid for the yearly membership but canceled. Though I paid, it was just too much. The online website should have more access than billing and profile, that way, one could get used to the varying tools and have a choice of using by phone or not. I'm gonna end up going with Routine which is straight forward and has community. The Coaching I can find with a different (free) app. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Excessively cutesy. I'm not a sexually-confused teenage TikTokker. One-size-fits-all advice, such as to eat breakfast. Read The Obesity Code. Too fixated on being ""fabulous."""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app for ourselves"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only 2 weeks in and already have signed up for the Premium Package. Fabulous provides so much content that spans multiple areas of life and positive ways to improve it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simple. This app just saved my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a gentle way to remind myself about things I want to do. I like how you can customize your routines a bit. I never thought I'd need a reminder to eat breakfast but...I do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I has been an amazing journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One week of use and the results seem promising. Many weeks later, still using it every day and I would suffer its absence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great experience for me you get to learn new things and you even have a journey I'm so glad that I downloaded this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful üëç app... graphics are very eye-catching aswell...keep it up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice can you make this app fully free, you can run ad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love this app is a life saver!‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is just not for me. It starts out with asking when you usually wake up and doesn't consider anyone who works alternatingly late/early. Then asks for your fingerprint for a contract (creepy af)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great it's just forgettable but yea"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Confusing interface"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This App definitely helps me to stay on track and eliminate some anxiety through out the day. The is room for improvement but the bases of it is pretty well thought out. I would like to see more pictures and emotions that we can add to describe out habits. Great App by far one of the best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok, I think I was quite harsh on the review I wrote, so here I rewriting it, the app is just mind blowing, but it has one very important flaw that being you can't backup your progress on the free plan, which really really annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes your details, leads you in, then asks for money. Scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way too complicated and annoying to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good for self improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please return my money. I don't want this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very soothing and thought-provoking program. Makes you stop and think about your daily habits and goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its amazing it fully encouraged me to have a routine it takes away stress of studing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Huge of motivation ‚ú®ü´∂"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's wonderful how much it impacts you positively. Starts with tiny habits to make you keep adding your own wished habits on the go and not create resistance in the beginning. It's price is easily posted with the benefits that it actually brings with."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Highly beneficial to have a meaningful. Life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's one of the best app for self development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Super predatory. Basically once you've opted for the trial it's impossible to cancel it before being billed. It sends you to the website to cancel it but then refuses to recognize your account or will say it's recognized and then not again the next second. Horrible experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The purpose and design is good, but the app notifications and interface sucks. I already checked a habit task and it will keep popping up on the notifications tray. Once I've checked something it should go away. Also, when clicking on coach notifications from the notificationa tray, it doesn't open the app. There is a big disconnect between the notifications and the app response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app. Sad to see how it's changed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"ÿ¨ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ≥Ÿä ÿßÿ≥ 20: ŸÑŸÖ ÿßÿ™ÿπŸÖŸÇ ÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿØÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿå ŸÑŸÉŸÜŸá Ÿäÿ≥ÿßÿπÿØŸÉ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÜÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿ±Ÿàÿ™ŸäŸÜ ŸäŸàŸÖŸä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After only 5 days, Fabulous has helped me work the skills I want to learn and habits I want to keep, intoy life. Feeling better already. Give it a try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The experience is awesome loving the progress am making."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lost me after giving me Michelle Obama as a example to follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the experience. I am trying to get rid off some bad habits and gain couple of good ones. I believe this coaching series is working for me fine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful All of in-app purchase"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderfully supportive!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"We'll designed but didn't help (and I tried hard)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very good app which helped me a lot to get into daily routine and complete my tasks...that I have been avoiding...I will write more next time...as I can't think of much now... Simply the app is FABULOUS üòç but the premium is very confusing....I didn't get it..how to access it..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I already paid for this on my oppo mobile but it's not giving me full version on samsung and wants me to pay twice. I think something is missing like a personal trainer live to go with your 60 dollars. It's a colorful and sound friendly app. Its over $60 to use it & i dont think i will renew for same price. Has to be a reduction 2nd year if use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It would be so much better if it didn't ask us for prime version for so many things such as adding more than 4 things to your plan. But I like it a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So much wrong. Clunky and way too many pleas to upgrade before you even start using it! Run don't walk from this money grab!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much. Well worth the money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I recommend this app for shaping great habits in your life. Take steps little by little in the beginning. You can view offline content as well. I'm thinking of spreading good news about this app for my friends too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Self discipline is always been a problem this app is taking me thru a journey in very small steps very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the fabulous app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"hidden student discount is a great deal, find on google. helped me with depression in 2021, credit where credit due. good content! however, 3 star because: 1) clunky. don't know why it uses so much processing power. a big problem on budget phones 2) takes up way too much storage! bloated, don't need everything on local storage 3) journeys too rigid. dismiss new challenge to focus on current goal? pop ups forever & no customization. I switched to routinery, this doesn't work for me anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The user interface is a bit disorienting at first, but once you get into it you realize that the developers really know what they're doing and are committed to genuinely helping you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Updating my below review! They do have a function to select the days for your habits to activate! I had missed it. First time I'm achieving all I have planned for, this app is something else... I would suggest the app allows for habits that are not daily, and for routines that start earlier / later vs static"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks!!! I got a morning routine to help jump start to get day. I have Fabulous to thank. Thank you 3*"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its so coodüëΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The work comes from the self. You have to want to succeed. But this app is a nice supplement to get us moving in the right direction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice and functional app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You need to enter a credit card to continue registration, and after cancellation for my subscription, they deduct the fees from my account, and you can't remove your payment card from the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like Fabulous, I've been using it for just over a week and it's already working to get me picking up habits. I would say in order for it to work you need to really commit to using the app and follow it's prompts, but it does work nicely. The reason I give 4* is that the app itself can sometimes be a bit buggy (e.g. my streaks aren't tracking very well). Otherwise I'm a big fan and paid for a year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app , will enjoy your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have tried a lot of apps for setting and keeping goals with no luck. Somehow this one keeps me going and keeps me going back to open the app. Has already had a major impact on my mood in one week"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After getting the app, I started to develop a good and healthy routine and it has really helped my motivation. I was able to focus on work more (well for the most part). This app is really useful for people who struggle to move forward!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating and powerful helps organize your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love all the different ways to keep me engaged along with coaching and letters of encouragement. Beat app to make small changes and lead to big results."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's pretty decent. Sometimes I don't have time to read the motivation letters, and I go to click on the notification later and it just disappears. I wish I could do a month to month membership instead of paying for the whole year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel alot better.I am being very productive. Yea!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too busy, too complicated, way too many notifications. Just didn't work for me. It's a nice looking interface, but that's about all I liked about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this so far. It's really helping me stay on track and stick to my daily routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Overall a wonderful app best for keeping one on a beautiful path."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription but im still getting charged??? this is ridiculous please fix this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It looks great but I think giving a subscription plan right after someone has the option or does pick to better their financial habits like spending way to much money, the subscription looks... Cheap and alright but not the best idea for a motivation app, I feel unmotivated... I understand some things were worked hard on but honestly.... I didn't even want the app, I'm well of, not looking for improvement, just wanted to kick someone's balls today before sleeping peacefully knowing that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Completing goals, encouraged in small steps, is helping me feel successful. Good reminders and ideas."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have a very poor customer service. I was resuscribed after a year and since october 2022 I still cannot access my premium account. Sent you a mail and someone replied but still no access. Sent you again a mail on 1st March. We are the 16th and no replied yet. I refuse to be deducted again in october but seems no one is here to reply!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app for building routines it helps you start small and build reminds me a lot of the atomic habits book"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!!! SCAM!!!! I cancelled this app last year and a year later they took a payment from my account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After so many step it says in the last that it's not free. Why don't you set the payment section in the beginning? By that whoever don't want to waste their money in a virtual world can step back without this much clicks without any reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Watch out for trial expiration. No email/notification will be sent advising that your account will start getting charged and they won't refund within 48hrs of being charged when you cancel. This is a business practice to always be leary of."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Try this app y'all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't want it. It doesn't work for me. I don't remember to look at the phone. Many other reasons they want to keep charging me. I don't know how to stop them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational, motivational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making me engage in my wellbeing and is helping me de stress at night before bed. I am really enjoying my morning routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is full of potential BUT it often crashed. Too bad i had a feeling this was gonna be my fav app. (Edit: it's 2023, this app is great now, useful for foundational habit making without having the app to guilttrip you all week if you miss just one habit, and never crash now! I am on my 1 month trial, let's keep it going until the trial expire)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Goooooooooooood aaaaaaappapapapapa"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wanted to start my week long free trial, the app charged me $1.27 when I provided my card details and I still don't have access."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I was incorrectly deducted for a year subscription and I raised the concern to them. Thay acted very quick on the matter and resolved the issue. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That's amazing u should definitely try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous makes your spirits just fabulous .. Quite helpful for boosting up the self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app keeps charging me even though I've canceled. I can't figure out how to stop it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Too many ads to share a paid service... I paid and I'm sick of having to close the share prompt! Other than that it great even life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changing life patterns with the help of this app. Healthy and happier with habits altered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have tried to set up a free trial (payment details have been provided), however, the request did not get through. I have checked the subscriptions via google Play and any confirmation emails to state a free trial, none of these. Therefore, I did not want to mess things up, and I just left it. A month later, I noticed that I had been charged ¬£34.99, not ¬£16.99 or ¬£45,but this amount, which is not stated on the website to be any kind of plan. I have checked my subscription again,and I have no p"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just another app that makes you subscribe for money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Since when did the app start charging at an overpriced rate and block out certain features like adding habits to the tracking list? No offense, but it's just plain bull. They legit just got rid of a majority of the free features and turned it into ""free-trial"" instead. Again, this is just plain bull. My old 5 stars for this app has officially gone down to just one... üëé No longer worth downloading for people looking for budget friendly self-help apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving this ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It was good until it cost too much for to do list."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, if you are a visual learner this one is for you, also I love all the helpful tools... great app and it's calming!!! For what you pay it's totally worth it!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is trying to exploit people when they are the most vulnerable. I understand that nothing is free and people need to make their living but and that's a big but offering a free 7 days then telling me I need to pay 1000$ a year to get that free week but don't worry you cancel any time, the moment I try to exit the app it's 400$ dollars because I'm eligible for 60% off of course! And with my third attempt to run away it would only be 1.2$month?? Now I got a 30 day pass in my email. Lucky me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for personal development!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Muito dinamico e envolvente com foco no que precisa."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Couldn't add more than 4 actions to a routine without premium :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it so much. Personally it helped me find my motivation and inspired me for the best. Really recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Make it impossible to cancel your subscription on the phone app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"there's so much functionality that is intentionally limited for how the app developers want you to use the app, but I don't understand why they couldn't just loosen their rules you can use it the way you want to, and works for you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app cheats you out of your hard earned money. They first promise you a free trial. Then even if you do cancel the subscription they don't register that and bill you for it anyway. The whole app is useless and ridiculous and they're cheating and defrauding customers. I have lost more than Rs 3000 this way. PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE THIS App. I still haven't been refunded my moment despite several complaints made on their portal and all your calls are avoided."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is exactly what I needed. I'm at a point in my life where change is needed. This app is like having a tiny life coach in your pocket. Motivation, check lists, great suggestions etc.. I've been using it for 8 days and I'm seeing major improvements that I am actually sticking to. I'm hopeful to keep this app long term, but the premium price may be a bit steep. If the 30 day trial continues to work as it has for me, I will strongly consider paying for the program. Thanks Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me a lot. I'm already seeing success"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires a credit card for a free trial, doesn't notify you when free trial is expiring, makes you cancel the subscription via their website even if you set it up on mobile, has several pages you must go through before they allow you to cancel your subscription, and finally they don't offer you the ability to delete your payment info. The app itself is glorified bloatware. It sends you an ungodly amount of notifications that sometimes get stuck and can't be cleared even with a phone restart."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what I needed. I knew I had a problem about low self esteem&procrastination. It made me realize that I am not bad as I thought I am, it made me to love me self even more and stop beating myself over small mistakes I do. My favorite feature is the morning and night motivational speeches. Every feature is doing fabulous work, but that one is my best, it's like a partner who listens and understands you even without you talking in wordsü´∂üèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"VerY very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helps me stay motivated to keep a schedule and with my adhd I need that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"RUN FROM THIS APP! They sent me an email to extend my free trial. Instead I got charged 50 dollars before the trial was near to ending and now they won't refund my money. Horrible service and a horrible app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tons of meaningful content. Free of the usual cliches concerning goal setting. A new and unique way of looking at your life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have only been using the app for a few days, but so far am loving it. The check list for my goals is great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app to help you follow daily routines, however I wish there was a smart watch version of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"How to ask for a refund please?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It literarly changed my life. I do the morning rituals every day and I feel fantastic! Maybe the best app I used so far. Good Job guys!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for 4 days now, and i got a good first impression, not only the ui is very calming and colorful to me, but the motivation it deleivers really make me want to change to be a better person. I hope that this app can really help me change into a better person. üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm loving the app but for some reason I cannot join any challenges? I Uninstalled and reinstalled still cannot join üò´ this would be at least 4 stars if buttons would work!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very great application üíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had an experience similar to others. I downloaded the app, agreed to the free subscription, canceled the subscription (and deleted the app) less than an hour later, and was still charged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app ever!!üíñüíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bakwass app....time wastage ü§¨"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So much helpful. Im consistently doing my morning routine and engaging more to building good habits because of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel greater with fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app I struggle with ADHD This is my go to App rather then FB and Instagram"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app seems to be good on its proposal. I wish it had a monthly plan, tho. Can't afford to pay it full year, but certainly would pay for a monthly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice graphic design"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious interface, but most of all when I cancelled my trial to premium I kept being charged for months (which I discovered later) -- they also make it impossible to navigate *actually* cancelling and even more impossible to request a refund. Once you go through all the correct steps (which includes switching back and forth between the app and the actual site) they tell you your request isn't eligible for a refund. At no point are you given the chance to talk to a real person either."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"i like it so far. will update review once I've used it more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app for self development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very effective. Little to no ads. Really easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing the only downside is that I have to buy the premium to make it better but I guess they still have to make money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"App is very overwhelming and messy, so many things goung on... Sounds, notifications, tap here, tap there. And trial period is 7 days which is ridiculously short. I wish it was more minimalistic and simple and clear"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me changed those little but vital aspects of my daily living. I'm grateful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Firrst i got bagered into signing up for the free trial. Then after cancelling the subscription min after signing up they went ahead and took the money out of my account anyways. I am trying right mow to get it back but dont have much hope."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was too much information for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for planning your day and more. Love the UI and all the features. I'm alrwady well on my way to forming new habits which will set me up for success. Definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to organize their lives for the better and to get that balance that needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how it motivates good habits. And there is so much more to experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best investment for ADHD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Ok. The stories are a bit lame but the really frustrating thing is I keep having reminders repeatedly pop up even after I marked a task complete."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Honestly not worth it. It's just another social media app dressed up as self improvement, that you pay for. You can get better self improvement from books and YouTube and just get a habit tracker for things like drinking blinking water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An absolute game changer. I recommend this app to everyone I know and meet! The monthly cost for premium is so worth it given the impact this app can make in your life if you apply yourself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't use the app for 9 months the forgot to cancel before auto renew. When I've had this happen other times, companies have refunded auto renewal if cancelled promptly. I notified the company within 1 week, but the declined refund. In my mind if your products can stand on its own two feet, you shouldn't be relying on people that forget their auto-renewal as an important part of the business model."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"No way to delete account. Notifications won't clear so I'm reminded to drink water 300 times a morning!! Get away!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app. I don't have premium but there are still plenty of programs in which I can engage . This app is not pushy about what programs you should use or keeping up with a schedule they think you should follow. The point is to set goals for yourself and try to improve on your own. You must make the change and they help you do that ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've never reviewed an app before but the customer service here was so terrible, it warrants it. I wanted a simple productivity app so decided to check these guys out. They wanted my CC deets on sign up, $57 for a year. Saw inside the app & knew right away it wasn't gonna work for me. So canceled but was still billed. Rep shot down the refund request without any details. Have to assume these guys can't keep users & are in it for the money grab."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for habits. Wish premium were cheaper"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's fun and busy thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great to stay focused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute waste of money. I liked the idea of it and did a free trial and suddenly I was charged... I thought that it seems to be helpful! This app makes you DEPENDENT to it and actually takes away the ""calm"" you are trying to create.. if you like to learn stuff that you can already Google but it is all in one place, and like to be addicted to an app, then this for you. I am trying to make healthy habits especially for when I wake up and go to bed and instead find myself with my phone more!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Should have read the reviews... I don't care to subscribe yearly, and I refused every free trial popup. If it was monthly, maybe. Tried using the app free and everything is behind a paywall. I thought there would be at least some free features. Read others reviews of predatory forced subscription charges, and I'll be immediately uninstalling. Definitely not the app for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too agresive. Too expensive. Too much 'noise' and colors and not much concern about user experience. The trial part is annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice, I like the warm and friendly vibes of this app. I just wish there's some kind of option to store all my notes in writing activity such as Journal /To do list."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate apps that don't tell you ahead of time that it cost money. I'm deleting! üò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app, even without premium!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You can't cancel the subscription in the app, they make you go online and I still can't find where, no specific directions. It was brutal for me to rate this app a 1 star with the amount of effort in it just for the lack of subscription management in the app, the animations are gorgeous, although I am leaving it, I might one day come back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow so incredible 1 week in, this app makes me appreciate my phone and use it for my higher purpose rather than feel encaptured by it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful app! It's been a great help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nicely done, but it seems a bit complicated for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App is affordable & unobtrusive, w just enough to help me form good habits. However, there's useful info graphics that appear often as part of prompts to hook in your friends, extra unhelpful as there's no way to get a more useful size of the image. Examples: Yoga poses. Also some obvious options missing from schedule (IE: Yoga, could look like Exercise), w weird inclusions like ""Prepare for 5:2 split fast"" I'd love an option to upload an image for a custom habit, or I'll use different app a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how I can develop habits bit by bit and also be encouraged everytime I have ticked off my list. I have also enjoyed listening to day and nightly coaching! Furthermore, the graphics and storytelling is superb. ü§© Great job!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this so far! I especially love the added value of having a story told to me in bite size chunks as I progress... really lovely touch! ‚ú®Ô∏èüôè‚ú®Ô∏èüíñ‚ú®Ô∏èüôè‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"YOU KEEP RIPPING ME OFF!! I resubscribed because I like your ideas. BUT I couldn't afford a annual subscription. So I cancelled it. I got a note back that I can pay monthly. Then, I resubscribed. HOWEVER, the annual fee has been taken out of my account, AGAIN! It was thought to have been disconnected then. But it has reappeared again on my bank statement, starting approximately the end of 2022 For the final time, I DO NOT WANT THIS APP! Please return my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me motivated to sleep properly and meditate every morning."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is life-changing if you follow it seriously"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's an OK app. Nothing that I can't do on my own. I want to cancel my premium plan before I'm charged, As my trial is up, but I do not see a way to cancel and have not heard from the creators yet. Canceling could be a little more user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's perfect for someone like me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I have used in a while. It encourages you keep it up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very cute app filled with magical stuff. It patiently takes you through your journey to being your wholesome self."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really wanted to find out how much this app would cost and the play listing only gave the range of 3.79 to 299.99. Didn't mention what currency this is or what you get at those different price points. I would really like an option to find out how much it is before filling in all my details"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish I could rate this zero Stars!!! I did the free trial and saw that it just wasn't for me and ended the subscription and somehow still proceeded to try and charge my card MULTIPLE TIMES even after deleting my account and making sure there was no subscription, I had to cancel my cards and order new ones and then they email me saying I have a debt?! OUT OF YOUR MINDS! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"How to cancel membership ..I'm in free trial ?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used the free trial on the play store and on the app it didn't. Don't recommend using the premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"In app purchases.. Asks for a payment to continue using"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fab"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Am worst dat after üëá it failed to install, asking for feedback,is it application or just instrument for data wastage üòîü§î"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT sign up for ANYTHING with this company. The customer service is awful, and for an app that claims to want to help others - the actual company does not care about getting anything other than your dollar. Distasteful and disappointing. Horrible ethics."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keepse on track and motivates me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app I've developed so many new routines and habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"tried to cancel this trial for days. Its damn near impossible. You can subscribe from the app, but can not cancel. You have to go online only for the link to not work. you can only talk to amber the ai. They have no phone number to call, and every single option that you try kicks you back to ai. charged my card anyway, now have to leave my card blocked or replace it until they decides to stop sending the charge through. It's like getting syphilis before antibiotics. Don't do it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app literally too 10+ secs to open With an annoying music. I thought this was a 1 time thing so I closed the app and reopened it again. Wow. It was still the same. Bruh it's 2023! 10secs to open an app? Really?"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing I can already feel myself more motivated to continue living in this survival mode Minecraft game No, I don't know what I'm saying either"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for two weeks, and so far, I've enjoyed it very much! I like my current journey, and I can say freely that I've noticed the quality of my mornings improving. I feel energized and ready to get to work after completing my morning routines. They are very simple and take little time. Generally, I have a hard time sticking to a routine, and it takes a lot of time for me to create a habit out of it, but the app is taking me step by step and helping me out to stay on my course."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am having a great time using the app! I'm still getting used to the app. But it's going great so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is for anyone who wants to become more productive/active in their life. Anyone who wants to change poor habits and replace them with good ones. I have been a member for a week, and I am pleased."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is so nice and now I am completely free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled premium, it shows in the app that I got no subscription, but I'm still getting charged! I don't use the app, so why is it charging me? And I can't delete my card number. A year later, charged again! Have to block credit card. The staff never replied to my email on refund. FRAUD!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Would be great if most of app wasn't pay to use. Constantly advertises full version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è it helps you,step by step on building healthy habbits. And it also reminds that failure doesn't define you. It deserves a 10 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredibly motivating, I feel it has set me up for success hugely. Highly recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amaizig u will be hapy by downloud it this is my advice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Why can't I get connected to my Gmail account on this app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Actually Helpful I got a 90 day trial and I'm just over a week in and it is the support I needed to start creating good morning habits, which has led to me being happier and more energetic throughout the day. Yes you can do these things yourself, but it is so much easier with the support and structure of this app. Also by virtue of preparing for a morning routine at night, I am starting to build a nighttime routine as well I'm Autistic and incredibly disorganized and this is helpful :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"from reading the reviews I'm concerned if I will be hit with a charge. I did not get past the three questions in the beginning. can I just uninstalled and be done and owe nothing??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying and benefitting from the level of guidance and huge variety of information and journeys available. It's pretty straightforward and really easy to use as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The daily coaching always brightens my day and sets me up for success with little dollops of wisdom."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't do it! They say free trial and charge you $67 right away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super equipped to help you live a life you would be proud of."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Don't even have to have premium to unlock so much, so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it but connot afford it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been motivated by the daily goals. Always looking forward to the new action plans."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"TERRIBLE!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app. The daily lessons are short but packed with great information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping hands to keep my goals and turn on some good habits and make some positive steps for the future"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exelent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its almost been a full week and I already have seen a difference in myself with establishing good habits. Was going to do the 7 day trial only, but now will purchase to have it for the year. I love the subtle reminders set keep me on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üòä delightful. Great way to instill more habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. I'm loving it but I'm only 3 days in, so I have to see how far this app can assist me. I am a chronic quitter and if this app can help me get over this habit I've developed from my youth, it is Godsend. I have the motivation to change but unfortunately it's hard to sustain. I've gone as long as 2-months and still have given up, all of this using my own will power. I wonder how far I can go with help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using the app for several weeks. I enjoy it so far. The design and messages are great, my everyday routine gradually changes thanks to the app. The structure is somewhat unclear, but to me it's not critical, can deal with it. Thank you to developers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the little steps and the reminders that are helping me move to my bigger goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The premise is good but it could do with allowing you to pause goals when ill for example or having an out of routine day (eg days you take annual leave so don't do deep work?) without breaking a streak, it's also annoying that the first set of goals all add to your morning routine and you don't get to select where to put them in your day. The coaching also runs dry pretty quickly there's about a week of options then you're repeating the same sessions over again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app love the alarm system and the way the app runs. Highly recommended app for everyone ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love fabulous!!!! The way it breaks down goals making it easy to obtain and the coaching is great also. This is a good app to get"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"wonderful and beautiful! üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find myself feeling off if I miss my morning routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is excellent. The problem is how I integrate the app into my daily life, I am improving that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The number of notifications you receive in a day is ridiculous, and there isn't a way to change what you receive. Further, it will keep prompting you to add things to your routine (be thankful, journal what you did, etc.). I don't want these as part of my routine, I just need something to manage things I want to be a habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty well designed and well founded. Only wish it was cheaper"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free after 7 days"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's been challenging to adjust but I love the motivation. It should be made simple however to help someone follow through on what to add and why we are adding routines everyday. Because right now it feels like I am being bombarded with a thousand routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So far so good! The way it looks drew me to consider downloading and I appreciate the reminders. Very encouraging about the small things I had to update my rating because Fabulous decided to charge me a 1 year subscription 3 months after cancelation. I have proof!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and interactive, I am enjoying this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really motivates you on beeing productive! I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Tried to used the free trial, after 7 days got charge for 2,050 for the 1 yr subscription, i have the biometric in my phone that I need to do before paying any subscription on my google pay, but for this one, i just never receive an authentication for biometric before purchasing it and received an email that I already paid the annual fee, and deducted my payment account. How come this happen, help me pls."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far Update, I have breakfast every morning and am definitely more mindful. I let things fall away for a couple of months and ended up restarting a journey but quickly got back into the swing of things. Love it, life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It consume too much mobile data !! üò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I've been using this on and off for over 2 years now and I really love the features. Sometimes it's been a bit glitchy (like the alarms weren't working properly for me for while) but overall it's a great app. I'm uninstalling now though because it is simply far too expensive for me to upgrade. I had the paid option for a year (and I believe I got it for cheaper then) and I really enjoyed it but I find that the free option is too limited. I would reinstall if premium was half its current price."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asked me so many times if I'm sure about not wanting to spend my money that I just deleted. Dont question my choices. Unorganized and set up hard to follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You all make it extremely hard to cancel. Please cancel my membership immediately. Stop charging me"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only thing it needs is more tailored to deaf...some are audio :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They just give us 1/2facilities before making a payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I've been using the app for just over a week. It has helped me to focus on some goals. I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes. Easy to use, I had to turn the notifications off because they were distracting but I check in morning and aevening and that works for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really love this app so far and for someone who has to take medication and has a lot of anxiety and trouble focusing and all those things I have a few more days until the ""annual charge"" but I've been reading a lot of people on here like all these reviews and apparently to get charged twice maybe even three times in a year I'm not going to lie mentally and physically I'm in dire straits plus the customer service is terrible from what I've heard and I'm a little scared I really want to jump in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous‚ú® it has interesting story telling features with adventurous voice with amazing visuals where you see yourself moving away the mountains... And there are many more fabulous things.. It's my 4th day using the app with free trial of 7 days... I feel this angel app (the angel behind the app working) can change, in fact I can see the change in me.. Thank you so very much for your humble efforts in building a great nation and World. üôè‚ù§ Love from IndiaüáÆüá≥"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*Suspicious.Just feel like I got bamboozled! Signed up for a 30 day ""free trial"" than to be billed $39.99 for a year subscription. As soon as I payed, I received a Fraud report from my back that this company changed me $67.00. The customer service chat was Automated and only let me choose specific things to say. Might have been an awesome app, but Nope. I would like a full refund and a cancelled subscription! Thanks! *Update as of 2/27/23-Still no refund, have now been additional charged $39.99!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muy buena app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"for me, this app is so good to people like me.. its so hard to focus on myself and being grateful.. i just start use this app today.. and it was so great.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! The best well-being app I have ever used, and I only just started!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The concept is good but this app needs work. You have to choose a duration for each habit as you create it and if you need to go back and edit the duration later you have to delete the habit and start over. The icons for custom habits are pretty limited (for example there's nothing that really can be used to represent taking a medication or supplement, caring for pets (other than fish), etc). The app also lacks a dark mode and is full of bright white screens, not ideal for morning or night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I got this app a week ago, and I like it so far. The plans that this app makes for you are great, and it helps me to be more organized and stay motivated. But I've heard some bad reviews about the controls when it comes to this app, so that's why I gave it a 4"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app helps me become more focused on doing something and keeps me on track on my daily routine on daily basis."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed for one day decided It wasn't for me. I cancelled my subscription (I even have a screenshot of this cancellation) And now I've found that I've been charged for the year to use this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is perfect for teenagers I love this app but I can't pay for premium but I know behind the app team is working for this premium is to pay for the teams hard work . Thank you fabulous team üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"fix the bugs first.. its only showing me options on a white screen.. cant see any question poping up.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A helpful 'watcher' to keep you doing the things you know you should anyway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly an amazing app. Just wonderful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing the habit forming just a little at the time. It can be unnerving at the beginning for people like me, who have high expectations for herself, and for the same reason gets overwhelmed often, and as a consequence frozes and don't achieve what I know I can. . A little bit at the time, becomes three habits in a little more than a week. At least a solid begining for them. The app is beautiful and ful if uplifting, scientific, spiritual, not cheesy thoughts, and small articles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app specially the letters, which keeps you motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I would totally recommend this app to anyone who has trouble making themselves organized I am organized not that I am not... But jt truly helps me complete my studies and it also helps me for my daily healthy life! I have changed a lot ever since I installed this app. It's been totally very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's such a amazing app for me & also a very useful app for those people who're unable to change their daily habits even if they want to ! Wow üí´ Hat's off to the person who has found a solution to the problem of crores of people üôèüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for everything . ...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's not bad but too rigid, doesn't allow for any routine changes and it's strangely gendered. You can tell it's targeting women, based of all the diet stuff involved. I just want to remember to study, drink water and go to the gym."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled my subscription after the trial and was still charged $40!! Customer service is a joke, no one you can speak to correctly and I've made multiple ""tickets"" just to not receive a response in my email. So keep in mind: if you want to cancel a subscription you're going to have to jump through hoops- might not even get the money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app! Everything about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is amazing but there is no back up option for the basic package. I lost all my progress. Definitely not worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Building habits works indeed! Quite motivating and inspirational too!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still testing this app and trying to find my way around it. Will return with updates üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is important work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful, but enjoyable too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lots of positive guidance presented in a beautiful way! We need this in our world."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a cozy app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do no use this app. I have 3 payments from fabulous in total of 150 dollars. I canceled my subscription on 02/24/2022 and guess what. I still get charged not only once with this app but 3 times. Google the charges that occurs it's a huge thing they try to cover up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Guess who's back !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really helpful when it comes to keeping track of my progress and reminding me of my to do list. The mentoring is also effective and very calming. The graphics and animation is really nice, very friendly looking that i enjoyed the overall appearance of my fabulous screen. I hope i'll continue my streak."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waste of time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app just the little push I needed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall it's a fine setup, but needs a lot of tweaks to be really great. The ability to add habits to specific days only would be huge. Skipping animated sequences. My phone died and in the process of trying to recover my account (that had NOT backed up, I guess check those settings early) I had to sit through the entire drawn out intro and tutorial and - waste of time. Plenty of great feedback in these reviews the developers should implement. Hoping for improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Used this before and this was pretty good, but uninstalled the app bcs I forgot to click I've done my routine and the tracker count it as I haven't done my routine, can't change that and it made me so frustrated. Wanted to start over but there's no option to skip tutorials and other stuff so I decided to not use it again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not even had a chance to use the service. To access the service, you need to subscribe and then activate your account. The issue was activating an account. I had a constant issue of activating my account and ended up not using the service at all. However, the premium fee for a year was charged and they didn't want to give me a refund. They said I should have cancelled my premium. But you know what? You need to activate your account to cancel your subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Couldn't sign in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Got a new phone. App has no login screen, forces you to restart your progress. **Update, found a convoluted work around. Customer service was responsive and acknowledged problem so adding upping my ratings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Lovely and pleasant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for positive and good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, works well and so do the reminders. Makes progress feel manageable and achievable by building up slowly. Could only be better if you didn't have to pay for extra perks/more personalised support. However, the free version is still brilliant!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me so much! It's truly amazing how much work has been put into it! I highly recommend it to anybody trying to improve themselves. This is so amazing, I haven't found any close contenders!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They are great motivational people, the ones that made this. I love the little poems they give out!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using it a week, but I've managed to set some new habits. They give you things in small bite sized chunks so it's not over whelming. It's certainly helped me already."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Press and hold an item to delete it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When i do the begining of the ap questionare the screen goes all white when i get to the age section so i camt read the question or progress without putting in a random response :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really good and helps me keep track of my goals and not loose sight of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription way before bill date. However I was still charged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app so beautiful great design and very inspiring wish you the best with my whole heart ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't make my rent this month because of this apps annual subscription they won't issue refunds AT ALL."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interactive and inspiring. Fabulous has become my friend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally amazing. Even though I am yet to subscribe, using the free version is very motivating. Well done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Getting better and better. I paid for the full app access. It's good to have encouragement. The app starts with small actions that are easy and become routine. I love having reminders. I am more mindful and much less critical of myself and others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really supportive motivational app with detailed evidence based approach. No guilt tripping and focus is on doing positive things rather than abstaining from negative ones which is a lovely change. App itself is a little clunky and could do with having a clearer layout for ticking off achievements, identifying your current journey etc. Would definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy Fabulous because it helped me to feel better about myself. The way that the app is set up makes it easy for me to engage in forming new habits to make me become healthier. I like the fact that the theories used to set up the reward system are based on sound research in psychology."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so best !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slowly but surely, this is helping me, reminders are wonderful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It is do cool in the beginning but you don't get to actually help yourself or start snything without paying. There us a free trial though for a week!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app not a fan of many but this one is awesome. Love the organization and exercises"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Congratulations on making a good app and I guess I should say thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The UX for this app is confusing and makes you feel like you're in a scammy mobile game. Tons of random functionality trying to sell you stuff, even with premium. You can't manage/cancel subscriptions from the app (have to use a browser) and they make you answer literally 5+ questions to cancel. Why tf is an editor's choice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For someone who is very disorganized as I am this is a fabulous app. Not a very good start for me but I am still persevering. This is progress. Best app I have ever come across . Amazing content."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am absolutely loving this app, it really is helping and I love the different journeys to choose from. It's hard not to find one I want to begin. I recommend this app to anyone needing a little extra help in life and where it's going cuz this app will help you figure that all out on your own and at your own pace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent platform, very motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think that It will be useful for my live.. I have been using this app a month.. And it has able to help me my quality life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful. The visualization of this app is also very calming and fun at the same time. Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So pretty ü§çü§è‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the small steps towards good habits and the motivational encouraging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incridible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing expereience so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is canceling our my normal alarms. I have tried to contact customer service. It's automated so therefore no help. I have tried to cancel my subscription before the trial periods end. Impossible This is a horribly deficient app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just downloaded it and asking for subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"You need to add more payment options for non-US users. Like domestic cards, or google play credits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app and all the team! Your effort can make a greater impact for other people. ‚ù§Ô∏è God Bless You All!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'd give this app a 0 if I could. I canceled my subscription before the free trial ended and they still charged me for it and there's no way to contact support! I got a robot and it said I wasn't eligible for a refund. I'll be talking to my bank about this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so awesome. It has programs that just prove that they know what people are struggling with. It had very effective ways to take care of yourself and build new, good, healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everyone is hungry for just money ü§®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, not a bad app to wake up too or consulte when you had a less than steller day. Will keep the app a few more day, as I have only been using it for about 5 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just feel fabulous using this app.üòä Words just can't seem to explain how much the app has shaped me for the better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Inspirational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is the most unused friendly app ever. I wanted to cancel after 1 day of use, spent nearly 2 hours trying to figure out how and never could. Worst app ever!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cool app, only using free version as cash is low right now! Changing soon!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am really enjoying this app so far. It's more of like a mini self care coach in your pocket. Until using this app I didn't realize that my morning routine is a series of useful actions that frame my day. I knew that in the back of my head kind of but I was subconsciously doing anything, and this really solidified it. I only wish there was more data driven content like a calendar where you can track your habits and see if you kept it up at the end of the month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app for about 5 days over a year ago, and for some reason just got charged 40 euro for a subscription I never signed up for. Stay the hell away from this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how detailed the app is , keeps you accountable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have canceled my subscription, and yet my account is still being charged. Thankfully I don't have money in that account. I went through your website to cancel was told it was canceled. And yet here I am still ( trying) to be charged by you guys. Something needs to be done about this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a great app that has helped me get back on track. I used to skip breakfast and go straight to lunch but with this app, the routine is broken down so simply that it's easy to develop a habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me work through my self issues and to overcome my worst enemy of self destruct and uncertainty."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really wonderful app with inspiring messages and beautiful artwork/graphics. The visuals alone make me feel relaxed and inspired. It's very fairly priced as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It wanted my email, name AND finger print then said I could get a weeks free trial? Asked for all of my information first and THEN gives me paying options to carry on with the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app.. I don't think the subscription was worth it for my goals. But a lot of helpful tools. Still using it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing app ‚úÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It keeps me in positive spirits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I unsunscribed before the charge date because I'm just too busy to use this app. But it charged me the $42 anyway. Never using again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"1. Premium feels underwhelming. 2. I became member through referal program with 25 percent off. The App magically forgot that when billing me. 3. Notification and alarms quickly become overwhelming with only options to turn of alarms. Edit: thanks for replying. Nothing had changed based on my feedback so feels more like deescalated review then being sincere. About the billing issue it's the fact it went wrong and you making me invest time to fix my problem. Fix the front end! Don't waste time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Overall I like this app, but I wish I could have an option to partially turn off the notifications. I want to receive notifications only about my daily routine, but I don't want to receive notifications about random articles and motivation quotes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Was updated to premium without wanting that and was charged. I have been trying to delete it and remove myself from the app but it's hard to get out from without signing up again and registering for premium again. A bit of a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice looking app with actually not that many features - it's basically just a normal habit tracker, but with many sounds and colors. The reason that I'm giving 1 star ist that this app has an incredibly aggressive and expensive monetization scheme. No, I don't want to pay 120‚Ç¨ a year for a habit tracker. No, I don't want to buy a water bottle for 50‚Ç¨. No, I don't want coaching for 90‚Ç¨. No, I don't want 10+ E-Mails and notifications in 24 hours telling me, that I should really buy all that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not very user friendly. Can't reload data if installed on a new device. Been battling to umsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app needs a nightshift or graveshift mode"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I want to give 10 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Reaching those goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Many habits and routines disappear when you get premium. It's strange. It should be opposite"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Como me comunico directamente con ustedes? Cancele la suscripci√≥n a los dias por que no me gusto mucho la app, y hoy me llega el cobro del a√±o. Necesito comunicarme directo con ustedes por favor, se supone que dan dias para probar la app y yo cancele la suscripcion antes del limite. Hola por favor, necrsito que se comuniquen conmigo, ya que nose por donde comunicarlos, me hicieron un cobro dw una app la cual ya me habia desuscrito y no utilizo hace mucho tiempo, me lo descontaron de la linea tel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has made a huge difference for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst even after I had cancel my subscription they have deducted the amount from my account. Also they don't have any kind of customer service number where u can call and clear your doubts"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My first experience is amazing, just loved it üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's calming.. like having someone to talk to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Notifications about tasks that I've completed remain, background music started playing after I disabled it and won't stop even after I forced stopped the app, honestly an overall invasive and annoying experience that I'm sure I don't want to pay for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A very nice app theoretically, if the client support would be at least not too stupid to even answer simple questions and if they wouldn't only try to get your Credit card information if you ask me (PayPal is listet as other payment option but simply does not function without an explanation)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged $60 aud after I cancelled my subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for helping change your life one small goal at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it help my well-being and me so well üíñ ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Zero stars! Took my money and never authorised it!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No issues at all. Love its reminders and motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app, except at the end of my coaching and meditation settings, the audio drops for about the last 30 seconds. It's fine when the coaching and letters have the text to read, but the meditations have all the instructions for what to do next in that last bit, and not being able to hear it, or read it somewhere else, is super unhelpful. For hearing impaired people, it'd be really helpful to have the text for the meditations available somehow!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very useful for students"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Listed as free-to-use on Store, but forces you to enter your payment information to use the app free for only a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the challeng iblove this fabulous application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many notifications"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disgusting how the app paints a slave owner as someone inspirational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute scam. It will automatically set up a payment on your account to try and take your money from you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a simple yet effective app that helped me be more present in my daily habits. Since I started I have been able to actually develop a night routine. The options and mindful support are endless, but not overwhelming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Non-existent customer service. Stole my money, I did not sign up for the subscription but was still charged. Tried contacting customer service and have heard nothing from them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app is a really good app.It has helped me accomplish many goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíñüíñita very good for real it's helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app helpnme alot ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too expensive for Indian market"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It just changed my life ,like as a teenager it helped me to know and love myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The price could be a little short"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was really hopeful for this app and received 30 day free trials for friends so I sent one to my husband. When he signed up for the free trial, it charged our account $67!! We immediately canceled and contacted chat support. No response. Emailed them and even contacted them through PayPal to resolve this. No response still!! I'm so frustrated because if you look at other reviews here, many others have experienced this too. It's ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good text"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Finally I got my daily timetable and all..thanks for sharing this, I hope to enjoy more"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small change can make huge changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only just started using the app but i can feel it already goving me the confidence i need to overcome my procrastination and believing in myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dishonest. Auto-renewed on accident after 9+ months of nonuse? No grace period, no refunds even though you contacted them within 48 hours of the charge! I'm calling my credit card company and reporting this shady practice to the Better Business Bureau."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is good and fun to use. It has an easy-to-use interface and is fun to interact with. The application works if you use it properly and hold yourself accountable. It's just a stepping stone for goal setting and taking control of life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had problems with the app notifications, then I try to cancel over the app, and was not possible, then I reached the support and nobody has contacted me, so I'm paying the entire year... In a app it's not working for me. Don't recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everyone should be using this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not Free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous motivates me without chiding or guilting! Fabulous supports the life I want for myself!! üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me a lot and it is a good place to focus on your daily routine and explore what routine means."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is absolutely fabulous I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"With the rising cost of everything, $35 is too much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app but I do not enjoy how much it pushes me to rate it or to share free passes with friends. These constant reminders are intrusive, especially in thr initial phase of getting into the program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app which will bring you happiness and calmness. Highly recommended to download üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best one out there to build your habits!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Abosolute life changer, it gave me a way to create a better morning routine which inturn improved my daily life. 10/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You all charged me even though I canceled! Super pissed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"REPORT THIS APP FOR UNRELENTED DATA AND INFORMATION MINING. THIS APP WILL MAKE YOU ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS FIRST THEN ASK MONEY TO CONTINUE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO USE WHAT THEY REVEALED IN THOSE FAKE ADS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ok so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Eye opening..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bakbassw"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app and help u to create positive habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How can you charge my credit card without my permission? *****"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think i should have had it for free dont like reminders for subscprition thats against health and well being"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent concept"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, the premium is worth it. This app has started me on my road to better self-help and self-love. I can't thank the creators of this app enough for how it's affected my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely wonderful & fun!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just love this app so much, I really like the idea of adding those motivational anime videos it's always fun and motivating to watch them. Fabulous is really helpful to build new habits in an easy way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"4 stars, because it's a bit pushy with the ""share 30 day trials"".(I don't mind ones a day, but every time I finish a routines...)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is only app out of countless ones I've tried that is so interactive, interesting and I am achieving my goals. I am adhd and it is not easy for me to stick to a routine. So far with little goals and regularly. Fabulous is highly recommended. üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged with the yearly subscription on January 30th, even when I was repeatedly told that I wouldn't be able to try the monthly trial, for the email used in PayPal was not the same as the one registered on the Fabulous App. That day we canceled the never existing trial,and I still got emails inviting me to join Premium. And if I log in, it says I have a Premium account! There is no way to contact them. They haven't answered on PayPal. And nothing on the site or app helps in any way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1 star for auto-renew"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. You go through the whole intro answering a slew of questions, giving the app your email for spam, and then asks for your credit card. Nowhere on this page does it say you get a free week trial. The app is listed as free. Do better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Currently having a problem üòï. Paid for the year and had no issue but now says I need to pay to become a member ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Love everything else but can't figure out how to fix this. Tried to contact through play store but no response. Update 2/10/23 - Still waiting to hear from anyone. No refund and no access to what I paid for. Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it üíìüíìüíì thank you for all of the work and intention put into this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Apps is bery nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WHERE IS MY REFUND!!! DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! I immediately uninstalled it and cancelled my subscription and they have still taken payment. CROOKS. trying to cancel my subscription and I'm stuck talking to a bot that is asking for something to be uploaded but doesn't make it clear what. Outrageous behaviour, thievery in the hope people won't notice money leaving their account"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even if you have the confidence and the drive to take control of your daily routine, this app also makes for a good supporting companion. It supports you with nice poetry and makes me feel more confident with my choices. Each interaction as I read and listen to other people working through the same obstacles is very relevant, and the large group of wise historical figures referenced often helps me stay confident. It's a strong confidence booster to assure me I'm on the right track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app recommend for anyone trying to better themselves!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good. Please add widgets feature"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Tons of helpful content. An app that actually works for you. Not one advertisement during my 7day premium free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It didnt create my jornal. I filled everything out and the the screen went blue. Im not sure what happened but I am on a laptop that MIGHT be the issue but I dont see why it wouldnt be compatible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Money is everything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful. It's helped me create healthy habits that have positively impacted the person I am today! I love that it encourages you and gives you short scenes and messages whenever you complete your set daily tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app for tracking daily routine and creating new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tr√®s pratique et motivant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome application to help you build new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love this app, which is why I can't always love this app. I simply can't stand most of the female voices. For me, they're breathy, indistinct, irritating.. A much needed feature is to have a selectable male and female option on *every* piece. I feel like 2/3+ of the app in inaccessible to me. --- I still also despise that you have to go through the entire onboarding before it lets you login if you have to reinstall. Not cool. Offer login *first*."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me to stick to my routine!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Annoying and sketchy. Shoehorns you into putting your pay info in for a trial then makes it hard to cancel. App's cancel link goes to their webpage, FAQ says go to Google, but Play Store doesn't show a subscription for it. Finally ignored all that and logged into the site directly despite the Help Page saying not to. Finally clicked cancel and was then presented with a zillion guilt trippy questions and offers of lower cost. (And all the app did was pester me to drink water repeatedly! Useless.)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This will change my life I am sure of that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless and expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have enjoyed this app and how it has helped me develop healthy habits. However, since getting a new phone, every time I open the app to check off tasks there is a background music that will continue to play even after closing out the app. The only way to get it to stop is to restart my phone. It's super annoying- especially since I have paid for the app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helped me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many notifications- I've just started my morning routine and ticked it off as complete. Yet the notification to ""start my morning routine"" keep showing up again and again, so I tick it again and yet it keeps returning. I remember this being an issue in the past. Also the music just takes so long to complete your action. While the app itself is nice, I feel like this excessive notification and forcing you to stay and listen to the melody playing is more annoying than it needs to be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Visually fun, good encouragement, positive suggestions, pleasant to read and listen to. Recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is such a helpful app! It is user friendly, it is beautifully designed, it gives so many tips, amazing encouragement but without intruding and being pushy. I LOVE IT!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped ms a lot. It gave me motivations, it provoded with step by step processes for better morning routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Honestly? It's a glorified task list, that uses ""behavioral psychology"" (and by that, I mean giving you compliments for completing your daily tasks) for you to keep going. Quite honestly if you have enough will to keep doing what you need to change this app you will do without this app unless you have a very compromised state of mind, and if you do I recommend looking for a profissional."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"AFTER they waste your time answering multiple questions & collect your email address, THEN they tell you you have to give your CC info FOR A FREE TRIAL. What a scam! COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. Grrrrrrrr... I am NOT giving my CC out before I even get a glimpse of the freaking app! SCAM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"the app looks promising, but as a start I already find the notification icon very annoying. it stays on the time, even after I completed the task for the day. not sure if this is meant to be like this, or it is just a bug"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a super nice app! For staying happy, motivated.‚ú® But one I would like to get fixed is sometimes it is glitchy and does not count like if I have done an activity that day or not..‚ù§Ô∏èüíÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Esta app es genial pero no entiendo nada por el idioma"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It still needs a lot of improvements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely helping me set goals easily enough. I struggle with my mental health and find doing tasks very difficult. This app helps quite a lot by making the goals small enough for anyone to conquer. This ensures that you will have a routine that you can stick with by the end of the day ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is a great app üëçüèº but you have to pay for premium to see a lot of thing I would like yo be able to see thing and add more routines without having to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"FRAUD & SCAM WARNING This app is nothing other than a dodgy attempt to gouge money out of you ... (1) I have wasted over 45 minutes trying to cancel my sub before the 7 day free inducement runs out and they harvest a full year's payment from my credit card ... (2) looked n both by google accounts... (3) To attempt #1; force you go into Play Store, and attempt it from there ... (4) But after clicking through multiple pages to click the ""subscriptions"" tab; the fab app can not be found..."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Noice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great use of Cognitive Behavior Training at work. I would love to give 5 stars, but some things are locked behind a monthly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love Fabulous. It really does help me feel great. If I could change 1 thing. I would set the start time different on weekends. I still want to do everything just not quite as early. The app will let you do everything. But. I do get a small negative feeling where it's not needed. I work a different shift on the weekend and need a different wake up time. Nonetheless. I love this app and am sharing it with others. Thanks. üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Bought this app last year, it was great at the beggining but then the constent updates and messages, quilt messages made me overwhelmed and not want to do it. So I uninstalled it and than found I've been charged again for another year. Just figured out how to stop future payments but don't know how to contact them directly for a refund. Please contact me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best program I've ever seen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app , it is so helpful . I'm on a free trial right now but I'm definitely buying it ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best paid self improvement app i've seen. Science based, inoffensive, and aesthetically pleasing. If you can afford it, I recommend. If not there are free/cheaper options that are similar and simpler, like New Habit, but there is clearly a lot of design in Fabulous that makes it worth the money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has truly helped get me motivated. I am hands down ready to pay for the year lol try this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not optimised for latest version of Android, I have to keep restarting my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been absolute wonders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the free trial and realized I would never use this. Canceled my subscription and they still charged my card 40$ weeks later. Should've listened to the other reviews like this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful way to start to introduce good habits to your life with lovely animations and uplifting messages. I has grown up on me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love, love, love this app. The motivation is great. Really helps to learn to love yourself and do what is good for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Just not good, requires subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really work wonderfully, besides it works smoothly as an app, it helps to remind with positive affirmation which encourage healthy changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a nice app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muito bom!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Everything's great except for the bugs and app crashes I have encountered after switched to my new phone. I am using a Samsung S22 Ultra and some problems I have tried fixing but couldn't were I could not make fabulous play it's routine in background. I have tried going into it's battery settings but it still does not work. One thing I have noticed is my phone specifically does not show app managing options for only this app on my phone. Like it does not show up on ""never sleeping apps"" list"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soothing amongst the storm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly don't post reviews to much because I never follow through on any self growth apps. So I would eventually cancel a payment, and not go back. With Fabulous, it is worth while, because it is easy to navigate, and also because it helps me build new habits that I don't do. I have felt a little depressed and I would forget brushing my teeth, washing my face, and to shower. I know it sounds gross üòù but please don't judge. I am also neurodivergent and this app has helped me through my toughe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good luck cancelling the subscription. Turns out after two years, I am still getting billed for it. And cancelling via the play store is not the way to do it or you will end up like me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever to implement new habits in a tangible way without feeling overwhelmed. I love Fabulous app because it makes it easy to action the new habits, there's daily reminders, inspirational audio, and one action step to implement towards the new habit goal that makes it extremely easy to achieve. Fabulous app it's exactly that, FABULOUS!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's good but you have to pay to get a morning routine and a lot of other things and I can't pay it ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but if you're a kid who's trying to improve yourself, and don't have any bank account or anything to transfer money, it isn't really much helpful. You can do just a little tasks from the free membership and have to pay for more. I think more things should be added in the free membership so that the people who can't afford can also get some help. Overall it's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really a brilliant app. It reminds me of the works i need to do and i can even choose any challenge which i like. It gives so much motivation to me to complete my chores at time. It's really a nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app i have used in my life.it Really changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really does help with good healthy habit forming and uplifting positive messages that can break you out of an unhealthy lifestyle. I'm about a week into my journey and have felt some much needed change. If you struggle with self motivation, this app can give some external encouragement to make healthier decisions that you struggle to force yourself to commit to. Maybe it's psychological trickery, but given the results so far, I don't really care. Highly recommend this one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app but I hoped if some habits were free so you can add them to your daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app but way too much notifications"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it! The program really helps me focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Mentally thought provoking and encouraging!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is put together very well. It's easy to use, engaging, and visually appealing but as most things are nowadays it is way too expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled my ""free"" premium subscription via Google Play Store because after resetting my phone, I could not even access the account anymore. Still got charged 39.99 and cannot reach customer service about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that the app reaches out to remind me to complete tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. So fun to gamify healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app...if I make it through, I would owe you guys a big one !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UPDATE 2: they still refused to refund me after I escalated. It's horrible that they claim to want to help people with their wellness but are predatory. UPDATE: Do not download this app or give them your money! This company is predatory. I have canceled my subscription on Google and the App, was still charged on PayPal. Canceled there. Went online to my account and it was still marked as active! You have to unsubscribe on 4 different platforms or they take your money with no warning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me with stuff I needed to fix in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A Fabulous App for Self-Help!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ... helps when u r depressed...but kindly activate the dark mode"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I look forward to using it. Really enjoy the daily inspiration."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing This app helps in unlocking your full potential"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It has helped me be more productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still on my free trial, but I have no doubt that I will continue. I really enjoy using it and it's helping me get my life back in order"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good features, but too many notifications, and the UI could be more minimalist. I want to develop better habits but only have so much time/headspace to engage with this app. Make it as simple to use as possible, don't waste time making it more elaborate than it needs to be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It just needs alittle bit of something , I need it to annoy me with notifications or something"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to create my own task without a pop up asking me to try the free trial. I did not have to pay for this feature when I used this app in the past."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved it because it has a very good routine that can help you to shine your future. I recommended you to install it, I can assure you that it will give you much plrasure‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The name says it. It truly is a fabulous app, helps me keep track of my routine. Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App doesn't go past black screen after answering all of the questions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wondering"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I really like the app and I haven't noticed ads if three are any. The material keeps my attention. I recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has finally helped me get my life on track. I've tried so many other methods and had just accepted my life would always be mess"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encoraging to make small steps of improvements ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful. Definitely helpful for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a newbie but I appreciate the gentle and througtful reminders. I love the stories. Feels like they speak directly to my soul."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"While not perfect, it's a good app with tons of resources to help you get motivated, stay motivated, or understand why you aren't motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me change a lot! Really recommend itüíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is wonderful! It helps me remember the routines I set out to implement in my life and the motivational quotes and audio is a great listen every day to pick yourself up! Keep on ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for habit tracking and making small consistent changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"S√∫per buena app, y el soporte tambi√©n muy bueno."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great to learn new and good habits and form a happy lifestyle. Best part it is free and would definitely recommend it for people who want to live a more happy lifestyle.üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of myself...i wanna improve and grow...so thank you üòåüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious push notifications. After 20 taps I was still in a FTUE, unable to disable the notifications, gave up, and uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far, but im still discovering it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is very nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this for a few days but im already in love. I'm currently on medical leave and have been having a hard time getting motivated and was feeling poorly. It has already made me feel accomplished, more in tune with accountability and has improved my mood."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was the best thing I could do for myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried this app out and found it is just a bunch of notifications so I cancelled my subscription on 12/31, two days before the 7 day trial expired. I've been receiving emails asking me to upgrade. I was charged $40 for the year anyways on 1/25. I have proof I cancelled, and fabulous claims I don't have an account every time I try to log in. I've tried going through their chat bot twice now to receive a refund, and have never received the confirmation email it claims I'll get. It's a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Free trial is only 6 days, not 7!! ! Started with the free trial of the premium membership, which I only used on the first day. They advertise a 7 day free trial, but you have to cancel at least 24 hours before the end, so it is really only a 6 day trial. I received no reminder or notification of the pending premium charge. Instructions on how to cancel were not clear and now I am stuck with a membership and charge for something I don't use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's has helped me wake up earlier and I love it so I give it a 5 star rating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I truly love this app. It helps a lot. I definitely recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad practice basically it gets you to sign up with your email then its wants your fingerprint Then Get ready for it ........ YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY I understand not all apps are free but when you take my email and fingerprint then tell me to pay thats just so bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It was alright. I didn't use it like I was supposed to. I took forever to finally set it up & for me it wasn't the easiest. Good app though just not for me. I say try it for yourself. There's a free trial! Remember to cancel or it'll cost u $40 a year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Most annoying app ever, it sends you 5+ notifications per day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i just love this<3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app, helping me set up a routine in Avery rewarding and fulfilling way.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app very user friendly trying my best to keep it at it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's alright, I do like it a lot tho. I paid for the years premium. I think it's worth the 40$ a year honestly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app for starting basic routines. I love the coaching sessions. I need to figure out how to fast forward through habits I already have and set new ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So my last review included not being able to contact customer service and inability to cancel account. Fast forward to now almost a year later and I'm still getting an email stating I will be charged this February after having ""thought"" I canceled the account and uninstalled the account. The app is very nice when in use but just too expensive. It should be a lot easier to cancel and troubleshoot when on the website."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Top of the most beneficial apps available! Free 30 day trial of fabulousness! Gain insight in multiple areas of life with the Fabulous Daily Routine Planner that is so much more than just an app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Add commentaries from a male's perspective too please. All your videos in between feel quite feminine and out of my linking."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The fact that the opening questionnaire asks me how much sleep I typically get and doesn't include an option for ""varies anywhere between 2 and 12 hours,"" and automatically sets a habit of drinking water when waking up like this is some great feat without asking me if I haven't already done this for years just cause I wake up with my mouth tasting like an ashtray tells me this app just does not get me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You guys charge me continuously after I cancel my subscription and can't even respond at a normal rate. I had to escalate through my bank just to get you guys to respond. Ridiculous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay on task!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Must try this app... awesome üòéüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it still. I don't know what will happen in future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The narrated stories are lovely and calming. It is also nice to be able to set your own tasks premium for a year is a reasonable price as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying,helping appreciate me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"After marking a habit complete, I'm still getting the notification pop up on my phone. I prefer to be able to clear this when I want, but it doesn't allow for that. Uninstalling for that reason. Otherwise pretty useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Genuinely useful, even the free version is a good starting point ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the perfect app for this genre. Do not I repeat DO NOT overload yourself there is a reason you start with just drinking water. I have premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very kind company and very cheap to!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you are going to start with a questionnaire add a box which says unsure or and opt out feature"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"User friendly. I am a list maker."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful üòä daily routine app which caters to users needs üòÄ I like my journey so far with it and recommend others to download itüòÄ üòä üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This should be listed as paid app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bedtime stories and weekly check-ins"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly effective for me! It was unsure about the illustration styles but now find them whimsical. The daily motivators are just the right length. Going slow feels best - don't take on too much at once. Stick to the program, is my suggestion. A minor gripe: Completing the bedtime routine gets tricky because ""disconnect from devices"" is an early habit, but then you must check off other bedtime routine habits the same evening or not get credit for the day... Hard when my phone is off!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a fantastic app! Everyone should have this app to help them set goals and get on the right track. This app is good for both kids and adults!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I need a refund and I submited multiple tickets but nobody is contacting me. I did not expect to be charged 49.99usd and I don't need this product. I need a refund. Please help me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great. I'm finding it difficult to start (I downloaded it, used for a few days then stopped) and this app never made me feel worse for missing tasks which many do just making one feel like more of a failure. I'm resuming again weeks later and was welcomed back with open arms. I love how it works and the stories. Thank you fabulous. I'm a busy mum with 5 kids and little support and you're just there waiting for me to be ready again. No pressure except my own! Self love is not selfish"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this about a year ago just to check out, I didn't think it was for me and uninstalled.. opened my bank account today to be very supposed they had taken ¬£34.00 from my account!!! .. have cancelled subscription ots signed me up for on the same day! .. where my refund!? .. very unhappy, will only be warning people about this app now!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Solid habit tracking and enforcement. Absolutely needs an update for widgets as the notifications are super easy to just ignore or swipe away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Three days in and loving it so far, it is really helping me to be more focused and aware of my daily habits and implementing better ones to improve overall. I look forward to seeing what comes next."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Help me get up in the morning from my daily routine it's help me meditatin in my sleep."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for perfect life of imperfect person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it. It's like having a life coach leading you to your best life with fun and ease. Love daily coaching and meditations and challenges. So much fun stuff to do!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"JUST FABULOUS üëå I really would like to write an article about this app cause it has done wonders for my adhd self it's an exciting app that keeps my attention. Thank you for keeping my attention and also lifting me up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Learning alot about habit forming and making good behaviors. Like the tracking method. Wish I could adjust some of the routines to be more of what my schedule is. Such as exercise being in the evening vs in the morning. But it actually forces you to do things that maybe you wouldn't and wakes you up better than I've felt in awhile."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not the app for me. I need more of an outlined plan."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the first routine app that I've actually used for more than a week. The aesthetics appeal to me and the psychology behind it is solid. Love it and intend to keep it up!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best application ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good app... if you pay for it... otherwise..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really fun and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancel the subscription but it still took money if i get a refund I'll change this rating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got charged during my free trial. Not happy, going through customer services at the moment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Marvelous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"If you don't have the self-discipline, don't bother using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfect app to start your improvement journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a week into a free trial, and after I was able to work through getting to know the app I find it super easy to use. I'm a week into waking up earlier, working out daily, writing a to-do list each night for the next day, & eating breakfast in the morning. I don't feel the ""New Year resolution"" high or any kind of excitement doing this really. I just feel good... maybe proud is the right word. I think this calm approach to changing my behaviors & habits is just what I needed, this app is calm."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Change is as possible as you create it to be"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tried many apps this one works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"the reason i wanted to try this was because I need some help recovering from the rock bottom i hit last year. especially financially. i need help with spending habits and learning to save and organise my money and stuff like that. and you need to pay for it. who is this for??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and interactive, notifications can be slightly annoying but needed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Update: went from 5 stars to 2 stars due to the annoying and recurrent notifications and popups to buy the premium version. I understand the need for paywall, but repeatedly spamming people to buy is just going to drive users away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely app and surprisingly beautiful and magical."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Oh My God!! What a terrible app. It sends a Million notifications about the same thing again n again. If you enjoy Dictatorship, go for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far liking. Install 1 week. Gentle reminders. Small changes leading to bigger changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App helps me focus and develop a healthy routine. Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish I knew this app existed sooner but the timing couldn't be better if I wanted!! Such a great app and only ¬£34 for the year, I've got a few friends on the app already and I feel like this is grounded breaking. I've read the book atomic habits and struggled to add layers of good habits on top of each other. The opportunities are endless with this app.. I would definitely recommend getting it, its only been a week and it's changing my life for the better üôå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cambi√° de verdad:v"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"little by little, but sure üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has really helped me put my life on track and focus on what's important. But it takes 2 to tango, so if you really want change, you gotta be willing to put in the effort and stay consistent no matter what!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm feeling more relaxed after this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulous canceled my subscription then charged me for a Premium subscription. I want my money and all I keep getting is some stupid chat bot. This app is annoying, and so is customer service. Fk this app...there are way better apps than this. All you get here are pretty colors and a bunch of asinine notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've tried to use this app about 4 years apart. After initial sign up you're offer guests passes for 30 days for yourself and 5 others. Afterwards you are immediately charged the $40 premium fee without any notice and the cancellation process is convoluted and hard to figure out. I went through the cancellation process completely and got notification it was done and now a week later out of nowhere I was charged. I forgot this was my experience last time, making a review so I won't."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. Still getting into it, but I love it. It's so fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First tried Fabulous back in 2018 and it helped. But now it's much improved and more adaptable to my own goals. It's deeply motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you will follow this app with a feeling of enjoyment and dedication it will be totally beneficial for you just give it a try"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If it was possible I would give this app 6 stars‚ù§ it is the best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Weird unambigious subscriptions, expensive, they take your money and no refund with no trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Kinda disappointed that it's a paid app. Gonna enjoy it while I have the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Some questions glitched by not showing the question."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm rating this app because it didn't ask me to rate it and by a coincidence I read ""we will never interrupt you for rating"" lol I liked that , also the app is extremely beautiful and cute with the colors and the sound effects and really very helpful, thank you so much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its been a great personal motivater in my daily life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall at the start it is a great experience, motivational and nice layout. It is slightly complex to look at and seems a bit busy. Then when you get into it the amount of notifications is overwhelming. This is the second time I've deleted it because I just cannot stand the constant random articles and sayings just popping up all day. There doesn't seem to be an option to choose what you get as a notification."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using the paid version for almost a year, and it's been helpful for building and maintaining useful habits. The team responded quickly when I had an issue, and they told me how to fix it. üëç I'm going to renew my subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"sehr h√ºbsch und motivierend ü§ó bin gespannt wies weitergeht!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its easy to follow and very incorrigible ,it's also motivating and I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice app, but the payment structure and price is ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lmao asking money subs to remind me to drink water every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Realmente ajuda a desenvolver h√°bitos"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is beautifully crafted. The experience I've felt so far has been immense. This app makes you feel supported, a bit like a life coach, you get articles of motivation and inspiration. I enjoy the moderator posts and the discovery feature to find topics that have meaning to you, because you can see other real people talking about their experiences and see people support each other. The plans and journeys, coaching is very interesting, but 1 step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me be better. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing app it's really helpful for me I have so many bad habits and sometimes I created problems for my own self , Yes it's true , I am not good but I changed well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"To access suggested daily routine, one of the first features offered, you already have to pay? Come on! Be serious!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm a 16 years old so I don't have debit card üò≠. This app is paid. Please, create free application.ü§≤ü§≤ü§≤ ""Allahu Akbar"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has been really helpful. I do wish there were a few more options to make your own goals and changing the times of each habit. Otherwise, I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps in all areas of life. The challenges are great also."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As it claims,it works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Early days but enjoying it very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Upon set up asked me to sign up for a one year 40$ subscription, don't even know what this app is all about yet. I wish apps like this would let you experiment for asking for money. They do offer a 7 day free trial however, I'm just not interested in setting up a subscription before I know what an app does, regardless of free trial or not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Starting to fall in love with this app, I can feel the encouraging energy build up within. Thank you developers for creating this amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Surprised by $40 renewal. Emailed them only days later They won't return the payment. Sink this company. Reflects poorly on Microsoft Accelerator."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really dislike this app, you can't uncheck things which is very tedious, and the main problem is how LIMITED the free version is. Huge chance the creators only care about money. I came to set up a schedule for myself to find I can only add 4 things TOTAL to a morning schedule, this app is practically unusable without the premium version, which- might I add- is advertised in the app every 2 seconds. Just PLEASE for the love of God make the free version more accessible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app with great features. It is a bit too ""girly"" though. I don't focus on it really but it is hard to ignore. I just use the app for it's intended purpose but I think it should have a setting for a more neutral or masculine tone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Every day now I have my own personal coach and cheerleader in Fabulous. It honestly is a HUGE help in stepping forward with confidence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One of the most annoying apps I've ever had on my phone. Constant, useless notifications. Constant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far. I think they should work on the volume settings a little bit. Other than the volume settings, it's amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Consistent, visually aesthetician which I love. Can be a little confusing at first when grouping your habits. Absolutely helps with reminding you of habits. I like how it allows you to set a timer for whichever ever ones you want. Encourages you to just do your 5 minute stretch. You realize, hey, what's 5 minutes? I find myself more likely to complete my habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Working well so far! Just getting reminders helps you focus on the small steps to achieving big changes in your routine and habits. The style is aesthetically pleasing and gameified enough to be satisfying to complete."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Buena, pero no esta en espa√±ol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hermosa aplicaci√≥n. Es como un coach profesional al alcance de mis manos. Gracias por crear algo tan maravilloso."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A bit pricey but it IS worth it (so far). I wonder if there could be special plans for people with ADD/ADHD. Sometimes, building strong habits is different for neurodivergent people. All in all, great app, very complete."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app it help not just me but my family get good habits that we can use day to day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabolous üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"don't let me add as many habits as I want for free and I'm out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They continued charging me for a subscription when it had been canceled 2 months prior."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent app but you must be ready to change some things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like the trial and thought the app was too pushy and esoteric. I don't need an alarm to drink water or a bunch of community chats sending notifications 24hrs a day. I thought I cancelled the subscription and promptly deleted the app, but it turns out it's more complicated than that and I got surprised with a $40 subscription they won't refund and I have no use for. What a gimmick."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They ask for to many private information. And it doesnt have a limited version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gave this a shot years ago, failed miserably. It was also really pricey at the time. This time around, they have added some really great motivational messages at the start and end of your day, and it's....making it stick. Like I'm 13 days in and not a day missed in my routines so far. It's more affordable now too. HUGE improvement to the version I used years ago. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just wanted to get my Journal back since 2019 but it was not possible. I tried with both of my mails. The rest, Duke and Fabulous team deserve a golden Star."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's great for use till you finish the main journey. I wanted to start another journey like it said but you have to have money. Sadly money at free üò¢. I love this app other than that because now I can't start anything new."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My glow up is un progress thanks to this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is expensive but it really worked its way through me. The app doesn't rush me to do anything but I still complete little by little the goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is functioning well and have a grear interface."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good idea....but the fact I half to pay for my mental wellness is kinda wrong..it makes you give it all your info and asked many questions including my email then it tells you you will get your first week free but after you will half to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app for creating good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not very motivating and very annoying. Huge app and loud and with annoying platitudes. Not helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app keeps me motivated and helps me stick to my morning and night routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoyed this app I felt changes in me on the first day of using the app I'm so glad I came across this app I love it 100percent pls every one especially girls should have this app ‚ù§Ô∏è."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had this year's ago. I canceled it they billed me twice . Not worth the rip off . Find a better app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps you build good habits slowly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a good app and really fun to use..it gives you your own time to complete your tasks and does not rush..but consistently reminds you to be your best ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Developer Want Only Money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"""In-App Purchases"" means a monthly subscription with a free week trial, and it's very predatory to people who need help. I just wanted a daily checklist thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm seeing changes in me, hmmm, looks promising üòÉ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, it inspires me to work harder every day! The only problem I have with it is that many of the features are limited to premuim use only. Other than that I love it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It won't let me uncheck a routine item if I accidentally checked the wrong one for a previous day. It makes for inaccurate habit tracking. It also counts my morning meditation toward the given goal of meditating at bedtime, so it doesn't accurately assess my progress toward that goal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Variable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Definitely a game changer!!! I would offer that each days listening and programs be automatically updated for that day, that is if the day beforehand has been completed. I find it a little confusing to remember what was done the day before or if I have unfortunately missed a day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the one of the best app in the World for all the people are improving their line I'm so grateful for this app. I love this app from my üíñ heart. This is the one thing i get from the God for my life. I happy to say the people to download and use the small pai of the app. Thank me later"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's worth every penny. This isn't a New Years Resolution app; it's small steps to change your life app. Great daily coaching and motivational stories. Just try it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous daily is a great app I started using early this Month and I've been able to follow the guide and cultivating a new habit of drinking water immediately I wake up and other great habit I struggle with before. The app is easy to use and less ad. I recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Way too many constant notifications, emails, pop-ups, etc, often with conflicting advice. It's really confusing to know what/where you're supposed to focus on and defeats the purpose of a simple focused approach to habit forming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging and has begun to build good habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This journey is wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A fun, cheerful way to set and maintain good daily habits with great short life coaching thrown in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful program and daily reminders to ensure you are also recognizing yourself as BEAUTIFUL! Definitely a progressive program that will help you change your life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app a lot, it's super helpful for routine building and has interesting stories. However, I wish it had an option for neurodivergent people, because sometimes the tips don't work - my mind just works differently!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Reminders help a lot, encouragement, small tips, motivating commentary, exercise examples for every level of ability, and a bunch of other helpful tools to make your journey successful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is my second time using the fabulous app. The first time was during the 2020 lock downs and this time is after a series of health issues plus a move and job change. It's a great tool for when you need to reset your daily habits, especially if you struggle to prioritize your own needs. Both times I've used it it's made major positive impacts in my life. I'm seriously considering the lifetime package as I fully believe this I is not the last time I'll need to get my proverbial groove back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great but habit editing needs to be straightforward, becuase you can either delete or only create it, for example if you want to edit the timer you can only delete it and you need to create it from the beginning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really impressed with this app. I may finally have found something to help increase motivation, develop good habits, break bad habits, clean up my home, improve my self-esteem, and so much more. There is a ton of great content!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to audit my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great for anyone who wants to start making habits. Not just making new habits, but making the habits of making new habits. It starts very intuitivrly and easily with simple tasks that are not unmotivating, then gradually introduces new habits to add to your day that really benefit you. I have not seen any ads pop up so far, these people really mean well for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app has helped me get my stuff done in a way better way the an alarm ever could and they make it fun and interesting to keep going."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is Fabolous it truly is it reminds us how to be the best version of oneself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You're looking at the reviews because you want to know,""Can this really work for me?""Yes it does.My spirit animal is a sloth, I can go weeks without drinking a glass of water, and exercise is ü§Æ I've just hit my 5th streak goal and I now drink a bottle of water every morning when I wake up,I do 5 minutes of yoga, and eat an egg to start my day.It only takes me 15 minutes to complete but makes the other 11 hours and 45 minutes of my day so much easier. Give it a shot; future you will thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing habit building in a storytelling mode!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"NOT Free. I was so excited when it didn't ask for my name or email address when determining what I wanted to focus on, so I was more than happy to give that information when asked. After submitting my personal info, THAT'S when they say that only the 1st week is a free trial, & that's only when you give them your payment info to bill you after that first week. What a total letdown, & now they're going to spam the hell out of me, & I will get nothing but aggravation in return. LAAAAAAAME!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forced on the rails chosen for you path. Unable to set personal goals. App chooses for you. Junk. Oh and you have to pay for it. Lol. 1/5"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivational app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pls show firstly that this app is paid waste 15 mins in entry"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed to try it and it wasn't what I was looking for, I uninstalled it and cancelled it. Because they ask for my credit card even for the free 7 days, they charged me anyway. Now the transaction is in process to be contested... Be aware if you give them your credit card..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a nice app to build healthy habits but the problem is you might lose your progress at some point and never be able to restore it again. It feels frustrating when you wanna mark your progress and have to sort out the problem with the app. And you notice all the progress you have made is already gone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me so much with my self esteem and with putting routines in place to better my life. 5 stars from meü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the animation and inspiration this app provides."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good until I paid and it stopped working. It looks promising until it stops working. The payment went thru but I don't have access to the premiums. My suggestion avoid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried for a few days and found it pretty useful if a bit slow and cutesy. Then is froze and lost all of my progress. The fix provided did not work and the help team estimated up to a week to respond. A complete waste of time and effort. I feel cheated by a free trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"PROMPTS TO PAY BEFORE A TRIAL PERIOD EVEN STARTS! I was not allowed to do the 1st Focus Coaching or listen to the 1st Daily Coaching Message unless I provided my credit card info. Very disappointing, since I took my time to go through all the daily habits to set up an initial routine, which I then was not allowed try out. Please allow people to actually USE the app for 7 days to see if they like it. AFTER a trial period would be an appropriate time to request payment, not before!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Basic stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and inspiring!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am coming to the end of my first week, and although we have started small I am really feeling a difference in myself. Try it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really nice app, happy journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The trial was 30 days, yet they billed TWICE, $39.99 seven days after I installed it. I cancelled and requested a refund but there was no reply. THEN THEY CONTINUE TO BILL MONTHLY: $5 FOR 11 MONTHS. They finally processed my cancellation request but will not reply to mY request for a refund. No problem with the app but I have a Calm subscription and preferred Calm, a little less juvenile."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"If you're just looking for a habit tracker, this app will seem a bit inflexible. But it's really great if you want to build habits slowly and sustainably."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total trash, more of a slow paced entertainment sort of thing with some half hearted attempts at improving oneself. Could be useful to feed yourself fake assurances that you're TRYING to improve at least. Trying. That's it. Nothing practical."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful reminders, great cheers, colorful app, peaceful too. Will change your life if you truly make time for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Constantly encouraging and offering support tools. Great for beginners trying to find their style"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I'm about 30 days in and I'm drinking water, eating more healthy, working out and getting organized. This app works! It is worth every penny."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I liked the app a lot. It is easily one of my most favorite apps and definitely the best self-care/routine app out there. Graphics, UI, and especially content are top-notch. But I'm only giving 1 star because of how hard it is to reach customer service and how impossible it is to have your subscription across multiple devices. I was subscribed for a year, but ended up being unable to use my subscription when I shifted from an Apple to Android device."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app forces me to have a breakfast. You cannot remove it like other habits because it is a default one. You have to press ""+"" on the top, to add (yes, to remove you need to go to add). Then select ""remove"" The daily teaching is naive. For newbies. Good improvement routine journey, but frustratingly condescending at the beginning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am new to this app but from three four day atleast i drink water... Nowadays it's winter so i don't feel need for water to drink but it's essential so it's a nice app let's see ahead üòá"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"this app helps me a lot to keep me constantly motivated to do something, some features shouldn't be paid for, it's a bit pointless but I like the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Since I know that everyone needs to make money I'm gonna put the fact that you can only add 3 or 4 activities to a routine without having premium aside. I really like the app. It's quite easy to understand how it works and I love the way it looks. I'm not using it anymore because of the money but it really helped me when I used it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful little app that will help you with your routines and building positive habits !!! Thank you. ‚úåÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It think everyone and I mean everyone should be using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me a lot! If you're looking for motivation, goal setting and peace download this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. I'm enjoying the app and the information given for each exercise üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You guys make it very difficult to üòû cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"These apps could be really good for you, but they never tell you right away you have to pay for your mental health. Save your money, if you're going to pay for mental health go to therapy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I use fabulous every day but dont get premium.I had it two years ago and i loved it so i bought the premium for 1 year. I became very busy with work and was too tired to do anything after. This happened for about three weeks. but when i was done working the shut down i went to try fabulous again and it wouldnt load past the front screen when starting up. All of my other apps still worked. I tried to log in on another device and it said that i never had premium. But the app is very nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super great app. Very motivating to me. Definitely helps me with my day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Okay best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. It is so motivating to stay healthy and happy. I drink water more often now and I'm currently starting to work out now. Confusing at first but you definitely get the hang of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiration to the MAX!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really wanted to like this app. Some great ideas in here that are completely ruined by the constant, and I mean constant, notifications and pop ups to buy premium, before I'd even had a chance to really test the app. Pushed through for 2 weeks, and just couldn't handle it. Can't open the app without a pop up telling you to spend money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply the Greatest üòãüòç I have no bad reviews, just amazing honestly. Join! to create a Fabulous you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app and I love its story telling is so awesome üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I donwloaded the app to try it out, I decided it wasn't for me and uninstalled it, but was billed anyway at the end of a trial period using the PayPal account I have connected to the app store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely the best life coaching app i have tried üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In such a short time I'm developing new habits. I'm in a better mood. I'm feeling better about me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't know self improvement costed money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Paid app... I'm sure the app works well but I don't want to pay for something I'll end up forgetting about or never using. There are many daily planners that are free. I'll use one of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not been on this app long, but already its helping me achieve small achievable milestones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't say much for specific issues but in general it is helping shape new habits and get more out of my day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam, I got the premium 7 day subscription trial and kept getting a message saying subscription not found when i tried to activate it. I then contacted the support team to resolve the issue before the payment was due however after a week I have had no reply and had no way of stopping the charge therefore I have now lost ¬£34.99. This is appalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great that this app help to change habit but one thing that I didn't like about is that we have to purchase it's various offer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm literally impressed üò´"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great step by step approach that is perfect for building habits that last"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If your bit serious about changing yourself the app is not for you. Don't bother if your not serious about making a positive change in your life. Set realistic goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm so in love with this app, it was so good to come back and see great improvements on it. The daily coahcings are my favorite feature for sure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have reinstalled this app only to be able to write about my experience. I have subscribed to it last Nov, used it for 2 days, cancelled the subscription in Google Play, uninstalled the app. In Dec I was still charged as if my subscription was still valid, although it wasn't! Ofc a refund was refused! Somehow it's my fault that I didn't unsubscribe ""correctly"". One ‚≠ê for this app is too much. Hope my money is all you'll be left with, dear makers of this ""fabulous"" rip off app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Faboulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic growth app. Highly recommend this to friends and family for growth and self care development. -Sincerely a certified Lifecoach in the U.S and Canada. üíó‚ú®Ô∏èüí•‚úùÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing actually helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wasted my time to realize after putting in info you have to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried it again two years later. Nothing's changed, it's still a 0/10 from me. Don't get this unless you're willing to pay for it because the free version is annoying and stressful. Three notifications a day. It'll notify you about features you can't use with the free version. It recommended a short audio meditation and 30 seconds in, it stops and tells me to upgrade to premium. The worst kind of free app. Not worth it, there are lots of better options out there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why was I charged again for the subscription when I have canceled it a long time ago?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very annoying!!!!! Went through all the sign up only to find out in the end that it costs money. Couldn't have said that at the beginingüò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"UI is quite confusing and even after completing tasks, alarm just screams at any time a day...once it started out of nowhere while I was in meeting and was difficult to stop I had to switch off Mobile...there is no way to mark if you haven't done activity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me ha sido muy √∫til :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I really like the this is customizable. The coaching is great too. I listen to the nightly coaching in a bath to relax and gear up for tomorrow. I'm great at starting strong with these type of things so we shall see if this one has staying power. It's started strong though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so good!!!! The proof will be in pudding."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far, it's OK. This is my second attempt at this, the first time I added all these challenges and routines that I couldn't possibly complete, and it was completely overwhelming, and I quit. I am trying this again. This time, I'm going in, knowing I need to just take it slow and accomplish one thing at a time then move onto the next even though the app prompts you to add this or that to routine, I won't do it until I feel I am ready."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really mazing app... ü¶ã"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm trying again (4th), this time its working :) I really like the changes they made in the app. The videos and the path is more palpable now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app is a scam to steal your info dont download"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great tips and a good way to keep on track to create new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wow! It's an amazing app ever I find Really I like this app and it's features It's an unique app Thanks fabulous dailly routine planning team ..,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app for self-development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For a free to use app, it's very good and I've improved myself alot, I recommend üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought it might help me structure my routine for this uneasy period of my life, but it was useless and took $40 from me for a year subscription that isn't even shown in Google play subscriptions. Clearly the worst experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app has changed and the daily coaching messages cuts off after a certain time. Also the meditation has become a bit faster and no longer it feels calming and relaxing. Can you restore the audio prompts to original version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best ui but could've loved if it was free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app literally change my habit and made me more prodictive. I love this new habits i have adopted because of this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, but it has some usability quirks: 1) When I click on coaching notifications, they don't actually open the app. (This isn't true for routine/habit notifications) 2) When I do receive coaching or activity suggestions, outside of the daily coaching reminders, there's no way to find those suggestions again if I close out of the app because I need to do something else in that moment. Or if I want to go back to something from a prior day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Everything good you might have seen about this can only be accessed if you are paying for premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Show simple in begin! But with time the things make sense"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and fun to start some new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice aap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this!!! If you want support for change, healthy lifestyle and overall self love then this is your app!! I've shared it with all my friends‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like itüòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply wonderful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Trying my best to follow the reminder. Reminding yourself is the constant state of struggle, which is called life. And the fight to balance that state. Good luck to whoever is reading this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hi, Faboulous team. I'm grateful for your app. It's a live savior!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is perfect to help me stick to my goals and learn more about what sabotages them. Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hi I'm 15 and I found this app interesting because I like fitness and I would love a happy future, now that I have this app I can keep track of time and do my stuffs in order, before this app I was having trouble scheduling My exercise and I didn't really have a routine, but now I can, I like almost everything about this app, but am I the only one that thinks that they should alarm us when to do the things we added to our routine, like we have to find the time to do it ourselves and sometimes I"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle nudges in the right direction make it feel comfortable to change your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Personally, I don't like apps asking for your credit card after a long survey. It's a cheap way to engage people in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You cant add tasks for reminders without being promoted to buy a subscription.... Not a good app wouldn't recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used 7 day trial, and than it automatically withdrew $39 without asking . it does not give an option to stop further suscription - suggests going online, but there is no 'fabulous' website . i wonder, will it still withdraw money if i delete the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to plan motivation Just what I needed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving that this app is keeping me accountable for the little things I neglected.. I love the daily inspirational messages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good habits...create a good life üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like how it incorporates habits slowly into your everyday routing. I think that the essence of the content of the app is good. However, the UI is clunky and it removes a lot from the experience. For example, I'll complete my morning routine then a few minutes later, I'll get a notification asking me to complete it again. The audio in the daily coaching abruptly ends right before the end. Navigating the app is confusing. It also always pushes me to workout in the morning when I prefer evenings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun way to work on self!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Quite Fun & Easy to Use. Once you catch On. You've committed & your well on your way! ü™ñüôèüé∂"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good apps. Help me a lot to improve myself. Recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app Just wish it was completely free. Due to a neurological condition it can be hard for me to stay focused and stick to routines. Fabulous has helped me so much made life so much easier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm really enjoying meeting my goals. This was one of the best decision I've made so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Change your life now!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took money even after I had cancelled. Now trying to get PayPal to refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good very well respected"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only first week free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it's going great. I can see this being a really good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1. Don't make me pay before actually giving me value, 7 day trial is insufficient. 2. Why do I have to download journeys? They should be packaged into the app. The app is already 70mb üòÇ 3. Why make me drink water as the first goal? Not relevant to my life at all. 4. Let me customize these journeys do not prescribe them. Overall great idea, horrible execution littered with a slow performance and unnecessary un-skippable animations make this a pain to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good way to build habit. Precisely because the take small, one step at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE!!!! I've been trying to cancel and refund ever since I subscribed and have been put around in circles. To get a refund, it makes you go through a bot. Then the bot says you will get an email from a person for the refund, and they never send an email. There's no number, no email....TERRIBLE service. The developer replied to this and was telling me to do the exact same thing I had been doing 4x times now. A person needs to resolve customer issues, not a bot. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its the best go get the goals appüíõüíõüíõüíõ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's okay. Maybe it's just me, but as a beginner, less is more. At times, it can seem overwhelming with all the new coaching and notifications daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Most apps are not worth downloading- this one is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app to self improvement. I am still exploring but so far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice and good apps I have been looking for...this helps me build my good habit and get rid of the bad one. Will continue using it for the rest of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it! Too much like Facebook to help with productivity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Couldn't live without it! This has definitely improved my life and my way of looking at it. Use it daily still!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam. Charged $45 automatically with huge barrier to get a refund. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time I use the app which is counter productive for motivation or self improvement through the app. Sludge."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app really recommend for anyone struggling with changing bad habits or have a hard time going through change this app really does wonders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I subscribed to the app and paid $40 for the year. So stupidly I decided to hit delete on it because it was freezing and not working correctly several times. Which is why I decided to uninstall and then reinstall, Not realizing that my whole subscription went down the toilet!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They really make you go through everything before mentioning that it's a paid membership. That's fine but be upfront about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The behavioural science wellness app that feels like it's using behavioural science to sell itself to you. Pay options are confusing and seems intentionally so. Looked like it wouldn't let you go forward if you didn't opt for the 7 day trial. Then boasts great results you will get just after that trial period ends. Provides some sort of confusing incentive to start pushing the app on friends. Just doesn't seem transparent. Not what I need from a wellness app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"üòÅ‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app ever, I only wish you have some discounts on your annual subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"would love if you could do more than one challenge at a time:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a week in, so am a little hesitant to review, but the app is very beautiful, and makes creating habits fun and rewarding."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is so inspiring and it brings joy to my heart to use it on a daily because it is a app but it's also a coaching app and it really does go by his work to make you fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app knows how to balance life and teaches abit about self control"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Very ambiguous and complex pricing model... And may be not honest too.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Made me so motivated to start new habits and get rid of old ones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great guide!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Sounds like an interesting app, just wish it was up front about charging you instead of having to go through a whole habit building plan and what I'm interested in before it drops it on me. Oh well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You take fingerprint as a commitment? Are you kidding me? Just rude."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"TOTAL SCAM. Forces sign up and recurring payments, and won't allow account management from the app. Must go to website, which is not provided via link, must find it yourself, and signing in is impossible, it just sits and spins forever, never allowing changes or deactivation. CANCEL THIS STUPID SUBSCRIPTION! I'm reporting YOU to my bank and federal consumer agency for fraud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many distractions to use the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If i wanna get the app and use it i have yo pay 340kr. For a whole year..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged a fee a year later and I apparently don't even have premium? I used this app briefly for free, apparently at some point signed up to be charged a year later. Best (or worst) part is I somehow don't even have premium. Doesn't show up in my Google history, so no refund, created a ticket on their site with no response. Would not recommend. *developers respond* however, I already submitted a ticked, two weeks ago, still no response. I'm sure I'll get one, Soon‚Ñ¢"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It works if you start small and build"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tap and hold your finger print. WHERE? I tried but I got stuck on this page. UNINSTALL and running to check if I've been charged for money . AN ANNUAL FEE IS THE MAIN COMPLAINT of the users who ARE NOT REFUNDED."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful! They continue to bill you even after you uninstall the app and then make it difficult to cancel and get a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It was trying to trick me into adding my fingerprint."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the style and design off the app, the prompts and quotes are helpful. I'm not sure how well it is encouraging consistency for me, so not sure how long I will stick with it - but I appreciate that's more me than the app... I may be better with something more gamified."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"User journey to resubscribe to premium is convoluted and broken"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's a lot to process to even set up the app and then you hit a paywall after 1 week of use. Waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Way too many alerts. I want an alert for reminders but none of the other junk. There are so many theyre just noise and I end up ignoring them entirely, which defeats the whole purpose."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Hard to go find your data. Wow a bunch of journals. Don't know how to retrieve info. Super hard to navigate if you're trying to look back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a relatively good app, however most features can't be used without a premium subscription, which in my view is complete waste of money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helpful, but I'll need more time to give a really thorough review."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I'm tired of apps, I thought this would be more accountable but it's too passive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, this last week has been great, though. I wish they didn't push for my sucsess to be so public or share so much of myself to other people. Sometimes, growth for oneself is enough motivation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Make it wear Os compatible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app .tad pricey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Though this was gonna be an amazing app... Why pay to progress, set one goal and thatsmall I could do. Great app if your willing to spend money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really enjoying the app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After 20 questions they asked me money!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App lives upto its name! I have no complaints. The premium version is worth it. There's a ton of habits to choose from. Just explore the app, choose what's right for you, adjust as needed & you're good to go! It's motivating me to stick to my habits. Some days I slack but I get right back to it & this is teaching me what matters & what doesn't! I love all the features & the creators of this app deserves an award. You are changing lives. üíô To change a habit takes time. ‚ú®Ô∏è Just keep goingüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!! I enjoy the smaller steps slowly leading to bigger goals. I'm personally an all or nothing type person and usually fail. This app slows me down and helps me to create actual habits I'll stick to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is inefficient and spends your precious time. I wanted a habit tracker and not an aggressive mindwash app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gross upselling right away and an ableist app that's not really flexible enough to be useful for someone with chronic illness and energy limitations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic reminders, beautiful sounds, easy to set up your own lists of habits, good inspirational messages along the way. And no ads!! Highly recommended. The small things make a big difference..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Preachy and can't cancel! I really wanted to like this but it's very regid, wordy, and takes SO much time. There has been a few good articles but they aren't focused on your goals, usually general advice. Plus can't cancel! Not on Google play and have to hunt down a way to stop the $10 a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How do I unsubscribe? I paid for a year, was incredibly annoyed by the notifications and adverts even after paying, decided to uninstall, and now the app wants to charge me for a second year of subscription. One year of my money is enough - please unsubscribe me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Needless popups. Resets your progress if you change phones before you even get to log in. They made it impossible to access the premium features and yet are likely going to charge again this year. Slow and ineffective, completely useless to me for productivity. Interface and slow loading PLUS the forced tutorial make me lose my mind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is using great psychology methods to improve some aspects of daily life which are struggle for a number of people out there... Keep up the good work! ü§ì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Got sad when I found out I had to pay for this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Though i loved the app when i just installed it and filled all the questions but i felt bad when i came to know that it cost around 50$ in the starting itself for whole year subscription. There must be any subscription available for atleast 1-2 month so that even middle class people can afford. Anywas i guess it is only made for rich people it's my problem that i born poor.üòá"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is bad business when cancelation of subscription takes a few weeks. Bad strategy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has genuinely helped me to keep myself alive. I often forget to do simple things to take care of myself because of my ADHD, and this app has helped me to not only do those things but make a habit of them:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems like a great idea. I wish there was a month to month payment rather than year to year because I always forget about the yearly payments and end up panicking cuz I think someone stole my card information and change all my cards out of paranoia. I'll keep watch on the app for when/if there is the added option of monthly payments and will sign up then."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've used"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"With this app, selph development looks like a game!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very Motivational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dussapointed,have to subscribe as always vs a one time payment. So tired of this BS subscription fad. I refuse to use them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"a well thought out app that has helped me gain some useful habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous and impressive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to get you to focus on small goals. Helps you create good habits. Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really a great self development App. The app is very nurturing on developing routine and new habit based on science and compassion method. I appreciate the everyday-motivational posts, they're insightful and engaging. It has been 3 weeks since I followed the program (Non premium members), and my mindset changes followed by good habits I developed. I'm looking forward for upgrading to premium, I hope soon. Thank you, Fabulous Team!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I opened up the app, and once it loaded there were several answers on the screen, but there was no question. It seemed like it was asking how much sleep I usually get, so I tried answering it only for it to give more answers with no questions. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Edit: I tried opening and closing the app initially, but the only thing that seemed to help was switching to a different app with this open in the background and coming back to it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you want luxury features like...üåàa reminderüåà....look elsewhere. It's coded poorly and I often need to restart my phone just to get the alarm to stop. I pointed out this glaring error, they said I should just not use the feature, I asked for a refund, they said no."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is unlike the others I've tried! So much more willing to commit to their habit plans because they have so many ways to help keep me committed to them! Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still learning and exploring but, I've been looking at this app for years and I regret not starting this app, program, community sooner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love.... It‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good for planning and stuff ig"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Learning the system, adding goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"NOTE: its $64AUD to purchase this app. Waste of time... can't even use the app to test it. With the 3 things I could add, I received a ridiculous amount of annoying notifications and once I clicked on the add there would be heaps of pop ups that weren't relevant and very stressful. There are some good meditations and basic exercises, however, I already have my own that I do for free from YouTube. So if you are a person that really struggles and don't know where to start, this would be ideal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has changed my life to a better one!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good for giving you small steps towards improving yourself and your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Goodness, does this go waaaay too slow for me. It's not soemthing that engages me AT ALL. I already drink water every morning. So to wait 3 days to see what else it offers??? No thanks. This does not work for me at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good I'm personally inconsistent but it always brings me back. The main screen gets a little Crowded"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app and give me postive energy and beautiful plans for U life((:"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really fun and rewarding! It's working; I'm building good habits! I can't believe it! With baby steps and small successes that build up to something significant, I'm really getting excited about my potential."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's lovely üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Aplikasi self-improvement paling keren yang pernah aku install! Versi non premium-nya aja udah baguss banget ü§© Ilustrasinya indah, bahasa yang digunakan bener¬≤ like psychologists, dan challenge¬≤nya super self related. I feel much better day by day with this wonderful app üíïüíï Cuma sayangnya aplikasi ini ngabisin memori yang agak besar heheh, tapi gapapaa sebanding sama experience yang didapat‚úåüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't bother with this app they will stealmoney from your bank and not only that they will refuse a refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the idea but there's no way I'm committing to an entire year. Month to month is fair - or at least give me a two-week trial. One week isn't enough."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It makes being mindful and self care easier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For many days, Fabulous was the only encouragement I received."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really makes forming good habits engaging, interactive, fun, and rewarding! :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app it is very inspirational to write in everyday, having productive workdays."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It would have been nice to know this was NOT a free app before installing. Also the music upon opening is irritating. I never got past setting basic interests because it wants payment info. Very sad way to start an app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've had this app about a week now and love it so far!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like thise"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app very much and it's motivative"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using this for a few days now, but I like it so far. The fact that it gives me some structure to the routines and habits I wasn't sure how to start. It's doing a great job on me so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's a paid app... Mentioned at the very end after collecting finger nd personal info"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worse app not opening"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome! The graphics are beautiful, the messages are encouraging and the vibe is just... AmazingüòÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like Fabulous and have used it on and off for a while, however they seem to be missing the point more and more, as they teach you that in order to change your habits you should design your environment to make the change as frictionless as possible, but they then ruin thier own app by burdening you with multiple useless notifications per day, lots of pop-ups asking you to promote thier app to your friends, and generally ruining the user experience. Not very frictionless in my opinion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription months ago this morning. I woke up with an email saying they could not process payment. EVEN THOUGH I CANCELED MY SUBSCRIPTION?!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app it's so great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This is the second time I've tried this app and I just can't do it. It's so hokey. It asks for your wakeup time but it doesn't allow for variations such as days you sleep in because of no work. Plus the amount of notifications is absurd. Not sure why I gave this a second chance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it it so funny ,and helps me too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"No free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Loved it , so inspiring and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A true game changer in the game of life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app for beginners wonderful experience as a beginner step by step habit development and all are free. That's great also graphics are of good quality but one thing I feel that there is no clear direction to goal like what goal it's just roaming you here and there like drink water eat healthy but why???? Is it going to help me getting a final result?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is splendidü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping get me on track with my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"dream come true üåàüíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is elite"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This fabulous app changed my whole life and i was more focused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Laksksks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So I have managed to add drinking water as the first thing I do in the morning as the first habit. What next? Just going in mindless circles with zero development as continuously bombarded with notifications until I have had enough. Trying this app for a month after paying for premium, waste of money. The user interface is dull and the audio guides were nice at the beginning and obviously some work has gone into them, but they are not that substantive, this product is definitely not aimed at me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Actual theft deleted by account months ago and they stole 42 bucks from me today so that's neat users beware of you leave they'll just take your money and run üòÉ right before Christmas and ya know money's tight cause well right before Christmas thanks fabulous that's some great service top tier"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've canceled my subscription within two days of usage. Since I haven't used it much. But subscription amount has been debited from my account. Can you please help me on this??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got charged without using the app and couldn't get a refund! After some days using the app i stopped using, not being interested in it. Not even knowing I was trying the ""Premium"" option i got charged 40‚Ç¨. I requested a refund straight away and I'm still waiting on them to answer..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good. It forgjves us for ignoring it at times and 'does not give up on you'. The kindest and most persevering app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started drinking water daily, then I started doing my bed, now I'm going for being grateful I feel like improving since I downloaded the app. :) Thank you <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely worth the little bit of money. This app is helping me in many different ways to overcome obstacles I've had in my life and didn't realize it until now. Thank you to the makers of this app! I'm enjoying the interaction, the tasks, and the many new ideas this app is given to me to explore. A lot more to learn and grow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best habit app that I have ever seen in my life thank you so much for doing this to me the best up in house with ever happens just do this this is the best but ever says who says this is bad no it's wrong this the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It s really motivated me, I wish I could pay a plan !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It seems like this app would be really helpful for me, but I can't really afford to pay almost $60 a year for it right now. I was hoping to use this app to help build better habits, including financially and I don't think paying $60 on an app I only get one week to trial makes sense for that goal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have ADHD, GAD, and moderate depression and only a week in I feel my symptoms are being managed. Even my partner has noticed and she has been connecting more than ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"im 3 days in (will try to update later) its been a nice experience so far with nice graphics and such. i just wish there was a journaling option or maybe not have to pay money for premium or having to pay less or something like that would be nice. overall its a wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to cancel my free trial for hours!! It just wont work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was loving this app. It is beautifully made but then out of nowhere I lost all my progress for no reason at all... I am very frustrated cuz now I'l lhave to start from the very beginning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Help when needed question"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such an easy to use improvement tool‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helped me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Edit: have received a refund. Please make sure to cancel both on app store as well as website if you don't want money deducted. Original: I cancelled my subscription on play store but was still charged 34.99. Apparently I had to go cancel it on the website and cancelling on Play store wasn't sufficient. So I did that yesterday and was charged 34.99 again today -- even after I cancelled my subscription. I created a ticket for refund but have received no response so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I especially like the pieces of advice that you get each day through an audio. It made me improve my planning and my ability to concentrate while doing work that matters immensely."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it only has been less than a week since I used this app but it really helped me to stick to my daily routines! i'd totally recommend this to others ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"will not allow me to cancel premium, worst experience with an app ever, instructions to cancel says to go to the website, will not let me log in to the website, tried to log in with email, says I need to log in with google, try to log in with google does nothing, I am about ready to report this as theft because there appears to be no way to cancel this membership within the 7 day period, the app is very confusing to use and it is frustrating and there's no explanation of how anything works"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its not free!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The user experience is difficult to navigate. I can't edit time frames. I went to write in my journal for each habit today & the notes from yesterday were there. How am I going to keep track of my progress when there's a lack of process to the habit tracking. Also, I am unable to access my account even through the website. This app has such great potential so it's a real shame to leave this review."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seriously needs a Dark Mode. The bright white UI isn't good for sleep quality in the evening. Very basic feature at this point."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it but wish this app was 100% free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: Really? That's the response I get? Did you even READ this review??? -1 stars if I could. Good grief. The notifications can be extremely stressful to those like myself with anxiety. ""It's been too long. Since we parted, if you solved everything you wanted"" This in particular stressed me out. A huge stressor for me is time wasted during depressive episodes, and this is just a reminder that I have once again failed. This app doesn't make me want to open it anymore. Good riddance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App sending GPS coordinates to Google, Adjust, and Amplitude. I refuse to use something I can't trust. Deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Steer well and truly clear. They offer a 30 day trial and charge you after 7 days. There is no way to stop it and they mess you around while trying to get a refund. I am still waiting for a reply from their support 2 weeks later. Scammers at work here. Keep away!! Edit. Steer clear. They make it hard to get the money back. I got notification I am getting it back but still waiting If they were worried you they would make it possible to control payment from ap. Steer clear. Get. A real person"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THE APP ROBS YOU and will NOT GIVE YOU A REFUND"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very effective, treat it like a game, and you'll find yourself wanting to complete each task."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small habit changes lead to major personal revolution. Most importantly, Fabulous can be tailored to your goals. This app has assisted me in becoming a morning person. It helped me better myself through a breakup when all I wanted to do was wallow. I've now downloaded it a third time and paid for another year of membership, because this app changes my life and whenever I feel like I've hit a plateau and need a little help in being who I want to be... Fabulous is there to give me that support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not very helpful. Hard to navigate the app and makes you take on habbit challenges you don't want without allowing you to swap them out. Wouldn't recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app. Impossible to cancel subscription!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't describe how good it is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app with added feature of supported articles on habit developments.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Didn't think I would love it as much as I do! It's incredibly useful and helpful! I love love love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unethical app. Even if you check that you are unsubscribed through the app stores, if you are subscribed through the website, they will renew your subscription without any notice or communication. If you find this charge on your credit card past 48 hours, they will not issue a refund... even if you haven't used the app. So the pwyc model is used to grab $50+. They will claim that their terms and conditions allows this.I used the app at one point but will never use it again. You've lost my trust."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very useful if you have bad habits and a bad routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having a good time and routine building is making me feel better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it for years"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had no idea this app was charging me every quarter, and when I requested a refund through official channels all I got was a bot telling me it can't be refunded. The subscription does not appear in the play store, and when I try to access my account through the app the UI just won't load."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It insists I drink more water, won't listen that it is not the way to begin my incredible new journey; I'm already hydrated enough. It gave me half a dozen suggestions about drinking water when I unselected the mission. It insists on suggesting a work routine, when I am disabled. This is also unable to be edited/removed. Contacting support provides you with a bot that wants access to media for screen recording or pictures of the problem, to continue. I already gave them my email right away."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app helps so much and the constant motivation to keep trying. I love that they're are so many things it offers in order to better yourself individually as a person ü§é"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"dont make me go through the whole onboarding flow to help a friend. let me give them value first and find value in the app myself and THEN ask me for value. product design 101"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Why fabulous? why don't you respond to TinaKay Reis' question left 12/8/22? It is a difference between subscribing and not. for example you should be able to save at least two habits sets of morning, afternoon, evening. Should be able to have one for week days and one for week ends. or if you don't work weekends, should be able to choose Schedule A or Schedule B or a Schedule C for which day of the week. Or what if someone has changing work hours shift? Should choose schedule A, B or C"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APPü•∫üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's a paywall as soon as you finish signing up. Once I close the paywall the app keeps getting stuck on the task of drinking water 3 times. There's a countdown and that's it. Nothing happens at the end of the countdown. Tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling and now I'm uninstalling again after barely using this app for 5 mins"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is just amazing what you can learn and do with this app. The only secret , is to keep doing it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would avoid this app at all costs. I had a yearly subscription with them which I cancelled a few months ago in the app. Payment has just been taken for another year and PayPal are refusing to refund the money."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seems like a good program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous reminds me daily of the good habits I want to repeat. I find the app very rewarding. It is so easy to set notifications for the habit you want to work on. The app allows you to choose what area of your life to focus on. One of my favorite parts has come to be the mini-challenges suggested."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been trying to build some habits and this app seems to be helping. There definitely seems to be a lot to it, from coaching to groups to routines to letters and journeys and etc. I could see how it could be a bit overwhelming at first. However, I think that variety helps cultivate an experience where at least one tool will stick and help build the foundations for better living. I have enjoyed the daily reminder and the emphasis on small, consistent growth. I think I'll be trying it out more."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I really liked the app untill they billed me again the next month I've paid for an annual subscription, so I asked for a refund for that new value then I receive an email it said that my annual subscription has expired and I just have used the app one month that where supposed to be free, they refunded the new bill but I never received the year of service that I already have payed for. I never asked for cancelling my subscription. I'm really disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Consistency is key"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good to keel u on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged 40 usd. There are no active subscriptions on Google play, in the app, or on the website. Why did you took my money? Looks like a scam to me. There is no email to contact support, only a form, sand I didn't received any email confirmations after filing a form 3 times"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm glad I downloaded this app it truly has helped me build and secure new habits as well as pull myself out of a very tough chapter of my life. üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app has charged me for a subscription despite having deleted the app long before the trial was over. I have tried going through their chat bot and emailing but there is absolutely no response. I am shocked at the terrible level of support offered. Very disappointing. Would not recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent app üëå üëè I follow all the morning routine it says And now I am very fit And there are even motivators to motivate me And have stories And now can not even express how good this app is"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a great app for many reasons. It helps me to be more motivated and productive. I have also been alot more positive since I got this app. I definitely advice you to get this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic app. Very useful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very pushy for a yearly subscription and my credit card details, I don't know how to navigate back into my one week challenge and have so many notifications it's overwhelming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My sister told me about this app! Very helpful to start up good habits and get inspiration from the lil stories you to listen to throughout the app. Super cute, so far I'm making my goals! Thank you for creating this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Luvit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have deleted the app, but I'm still getting the audio (chime) notifications in the morning and evening. Must be some glitch? Has anyone experienced this? It's very annoying and distracting. Edit: I canceled this subscription last year, and they just charged me $35.99. It doesn't even show up as a subscription on my Google play account. Very dissatisfied."

I started today and I keeped my progress at top, thanks to this wonderful app I'll be doing my best efforts! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëèüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lovel app to build and nourish good habits.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I purchased a subscription through google play i didnt have time to use the app so i cancelled my subscription on December 2nd and still got charged $39.99 for something i don't even use so i leave 1 star unless they make it right then ill update my review."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charges my card every year with out my permission. No way of getting refund. I do t even use this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Started the free trial, then canceled before it charged due to not enjoying the service. Now it is continuing to try charging me $40, and I keep declining transactions, and trying to cancel my subscription. It's not working."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My favorite app. If I had to choose one app that I'd pay for to have on my phone This Is It. It has helped me so much to find a way to a happier me. One thing what I think wi make this app even more amazing is the option to set the nightly coaching on repeat, so I can listen to it while I fall asleep"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are very tricky and dishonest in their approach. They show you a beautiful colorful app, you put all your data and info and then before showing any value, they ask for your credit card. Disgusting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I didn't expect the free version would work so well. So far so good - it's what I was looking for at this time in my life. We'll see if I can stick to it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wonderful idea but can't delete or rearrange task schedule. I am a seasonal worker and student. My schedule schedule changes four times a year. If It's a school break, I don't need a, do homework, task. I sometimes experiment with timing of a habit to see what feels best. People change their mind, having the ability to rearrange or delete is important. Otherwise we are left feeling like a failure when a streak of a habit is broken, that no longer even matters."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the accountability and design"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es muy f√°cil de usar, interactiva y tiene buena cantidad de contenido gratis que hace de que uno quiera m√°s"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever! I can feel the change within me, there's smthg I'd love this app for. It's so cute and helpful damn. The stuff had work hard for this and I thanks em for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"beautiful app, it has really helped me with setting and keeping healthy habits, it was a little overwhelming at first glance but now I can't live without it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the best app I ever had It changed my self . When I think about my older self , I see that I am completely changed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best I ever had. This app is changing my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it.it is actually fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to be used , helped me getting better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Getting 15 notifications in a day is totally normal, and totally irritating. Its 8am and I've already gotten 4.This isn't for the average person, it's for professionals. I've tried it a few times and it really misses the mark. They're also super sneaky about the payments. It's a whole process to cancel, and when you think you have canceled, suddenly your card is charged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"While the idea seems solid, the app froze every single time I went to it via a notification. I gave it 3 chances, but could never interact with the app if I used a notification to get there. Getting the app to work required a hard reboot of the app every time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Good idea... but the app is too annoying, complicated and confusing. And the style is not to my personal liking. Furthermore, I do not like their aggressive customer retention techniques. This seems like a trap to extract money from you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"4 or 5 stars overall, 1 star for the marketing. Probably has a lot of good advice, but I can't trust it when it keeps including undisclosed ads: ""You should get a [product] we at The Fabulous like this one. It's getting great reviews on [site]. It also tries to convince you that need a paid subscription to achieve your goals. When I canceled, I got an email telling me not to ""give up"" on my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing. It will change your life and style of Living."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The first task was to drink water 3 different times in a week. Then it pulls up a video mentioning Michelle Obama (lol), who may or may not be a woman, and I'm already feeling alienated by the whole experience on a political level, and can't focus on anything because I'm too busy thinking about the actual literal demons we have for leaders, and here I am writing a review about this experience, which is totally opposite to what I hoped would happen for my ADHD. Thanks Obama."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trying to cancel payments is a nightmare. This app is a scam, you can drink water every morning without using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far do good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Effective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app took my money without my consent and will not refund me my $32. I have deleted the app and it still charged me and denied my refund!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's so awesome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had this app for about a week. Got the free trial for my son, cancelled it before it was charged. Well that was a year ago, and surprise! I see a charge for fabulous on my card. I immediately contacted Google Play support and they got it removed. From the number of recent reviews complaining about this issue either A. It seems this developer has some coding issues with the app and its still charging after cancelling, or B. They're intentionally charging and hoping the person doesn't notice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its not my first time using this app. When i lost my phone i had to make sure its the first app i need on my phone, id rather go without instagram and Facebook rather than this app. It keeps me organized and makes it easier to create new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very amazing app it helps to build habits better than any other app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helpful tracker and motivation for bite sized habit stacking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"feels like a cult"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me a lot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"it helps me a lot to become productive. too sad it required premiums but it's super helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good at motivating and has many ways to do it to fit everyone's need and want 100% recomend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a great app but why do i have to pay to use it? I would a vip or something so that they make money but some people need apps like this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like most the engagement aspects across every interaction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, step by step guide"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall it's a great concept and features lots of useful tools to help you develop good habits gradually. I really like the guided mindfulness exercises as well. The app sends notifications constantly and there's no way to turn them off. Most notifications add no value to my day and are an annoyance. I've also found the app quite buggy, losing my progress in challenges fairly often."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That's amazing app ,iam really enjoying üíóüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Though the routine concept is not wrong, the final impact this software could have on behavior changes is still very limited and lack digitization analysis to see how much it can help on human behavior changes. The lack of multi-device synchornization support is also a minus. From my previous 2 weeks usage , this app is completely a garbage, my performance scoring ( consists of focus hours, exercise times, bad habit abstinence ) even worsened after using this app. Absolutely a disappoinment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No ad is a biggest good attraction üß≤ of user in this platform Fully satisfied with developed technology and human efforts Giving 10/10"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great for getting back on your feet again. I surely recommend it to whoever needs motivation or need to get productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you're looking for an app that helps you in improving yourself and would constantly remind you of your tasks, then this is app is for you. However, if you're looking for an app that focuses on making you feel good even without accomplishing anything, then you have to choose a different one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app itself is fabulous. But once I updated my phone thus app started f'ing up my phone. I couldn't access anything... had to uninstall just to get control of my phone again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Won't let you try your free 7 days without giving your credit payment information first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful application, really has helped me ditch old negative habits, and gain positive ones!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful artworks and a strong scientific basis make this self help app very effective and fun to use, but the monetization seems to stop you from developing stronger habits, limiting the apps actual effectiveness"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I enjoyed using this app, but then they showed me an infographic about zodiac signs. Yes, really, zodiac signs. I would expect more from an app which main selling point is ""scientifically proven""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Made with care ‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal app, gets your life back on track with a ready schedule and a community aspiring for the same things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am a list person and really enjoy reminders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid for a free trial to see how the app works. Was charged but the account doesn't exist and I definitely didn't get the free trial. Reached out to customer service and it was just a bot that said we'll get back to you in 10 days... UI isn't even good. Too much going on for something that was supposed to be simple."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its quite a good app to start with some basic but healthy habit and to maintain them though..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash. Charged during the trial period, then they say it can take up to two weeks to get a response from customer support. Shameful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the positive vibes and thoughtful reminders. It helps keep you focused on positive improvements to your daily life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm fighting stage 4 cancer and this app is helping me enormously Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best and most interesting app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Appallingly ableist"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soo good üëçüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"1st week the notification is like a poke & I might be off schedule but I'm getting it in!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice but money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is a program in which the Arabic language is not available üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged me full price even though I canceled!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good ü¶ã"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like a lot of the features and the approach to building habits incrementally. I DO NOT like the endless uncategorized notifications to forums that I don't read. I deal with ADHD and don't need notifications that I haven't deemed a priority thruought the day. The uncategorized notifications actively discourage me from opening the app for what I actually use it for. When I see more than one notification on my notifications page from the app my brain filters it because it's overwhelming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware! They somehow got my payment method from Google and even though I cancelled the same day (not a useful app) they just tried to take money out of my account. I have emailed them and they have given me a standard 10 day turn around eta. So that means I can't use my bank account until they decide to get back to me in fear they will take my money for an app that I don't want and already processed a cancellation of subscription in august."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It great and all but...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Training plans are alright, but the free trial subscription is too short and I was auto charged without any warning from the app. $45 for a one year subscription. Very frustrating, I wish they had a pay monthly option because now I have paid for a service I'm not going to use and I definitely could have used the money more than the service right now. Getting so abruptly charged for so much money by an app I'm on the fence about was enough to make me uninstall and unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm very very disappointed. This App charged me 2x without my consent. They make money out of people like that: raping their pockets. I really liked the app at the beginning. But even after I unsubscribed from Google Play, they charged me because I didn't unsubscribed from the website. That's disgusting and dishonest. When I subscribed the first time they charged me from my card AND my Paypal. My mistake. Should never have given my card number."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i've been looking for an app to help me curate, maintain & track my habits. this app is everything I've been looking for üòç absolutely love it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please give me a refund I don't think this is cool how are you gonna make me pay for something I didn't want I am so poor I have the worst life I really didn't wanna pay this I wanna die"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The morning and evening routines help me take control of my time and be productive. It's helping me make good habits and keep them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making healthy habits through this app is a greater experience of my life.üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good. I'm just done with week one. It's annoying that I can't rewind or stash my lessons and come back to it at a later time when I'm free. The notifications randomly pop up and are lost forever if you leave it mid session"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I usually hate these apps because you have to be tethered to your phone doing one exercise, reading articles, logging this or that. This app isn't like that. I find it truly inspiring and helps me constantly reflect and move forward. It would be nice if you could save specific motivation articles so you can listen to them again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I find this app moderately helpful. It's not the most user-friendly interface experience, but overall I find that it is helping me start my day better than I did previously."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Low grade payment options WHY CANT I CANCEL MY PAYMENTS LIKE A NORMAL APP?? So you've locked me into a yearly payment which technically holds my money to a ransom every 365 days because your subscription system is so convoluted. What a scummy move. For potential subscribers - do yourself a favour and just Google self help and motivational habits. You'll save yourself money and a headache. Disgrace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice really good app I like how it works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceeded my expectations and makes me want to push beyond with the support system."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"wonderful app to slowly build great habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I found this app to be extremely helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing way to stay motivated and keep track of your progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's much better than I anticipated. The only issue is that non-premium users have very limited access to features. It would be preferable if some procedures were free (like voice coaching) in order to assist people like us who cannot just purchase the subscription. Overall, this app is worthwhile to try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me get thru hard times in my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am improving my self bcz of this it's really great app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"By far the best habit tracker I've used and well worth the ¬£34.99 per year for premium. You start with really tiny steps that become second nature in no time. The daily coaching is motivational and the online community encouraging if you feel yourself sliding back. I had a small snag with setting up my premium membership but customer service dealt with this perfectly. Use it; you won't regret it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a good app, but there should be a little more free options. In all, an amazing appreciation.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great way to form good habits and breakaway from bad ones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love the reminders alarm and daily challenges! My life is surely getting back on track!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very confusing app. Why did it automatically sign me up to a free trial? How to I cancel?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome so far definitely keeps me accountable and helps me remember to stay on task to change my habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. I got the trial of the app last year, never used it and got charged because I didn't cancel. My fault, no complaints. Then, I didn't know it was going to charge me again a year later to renew this service I never used. After I was charged the second year for an app I never used, I wrote in to explain the situation and asked for a refund for only the most recent charge, and they refused. Kindness obviously isn't an important part of their customer service practices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exactly what the app says - fabulous. Getting back into a routine after having been out of action for a year after a serious accident, is the best thing that FABULOUS could do for me! I needed to start with small steps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"From this app i learn new habits and start developing myself in new version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Supporters"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing application. The immersive storytelling and day by day challenges help you continue the habits you are trying to make"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly just downloaded this on a whim, but so far, so good... really goodü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A lot of effort and care went into this app. However, a few aspects made me uninstall it. 1) user interface is a bit cluttered. On the main page, new notifications pop up at the top of the list. What I really want is to focus on the goals I set up, so a focused mode without any other clutter would be nice. 2) too many reminders. I felt like the app was nagging me after a while. I'd prefer if it was a background app that I would log into to update on my own. Finally, I want stats of my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastically designed, with several guides and challenges to help keep you moving forward."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helpful in a way that I never thought ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much! It had actually encouraged me to persist in healthy habits, like drinking water first thing in the morning. I had no idea, but it really does make a difference. I have already recommended this app to friends and family! Thank you guys for this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Didn't think it'd be useful, but I was wrong. This app is great and I'll probably ed up getting the paid version soon. This app is slowly changing my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hiiuy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is unclear you are signing up for big payments. You can't cancel in the app and need to use their website, which makes it as hard as possible to cancel. They charge you $50 even if you DO immediately cancel your plan. My bank automatically flagged their charge as fraud so they didn't get my money. Cancelled sub, deleted app, emailed them, and they still keep sending emails about ""declined payments"". Oh, and the app is a cluttered overwhelming mess. Worst UX of any habit tracker/planner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"is there a 6 star button i am missing? amazing app. this app has helped me with organizing my life quite a bit. my life is finally together. now do keep in mind that installing this app will not do anything for you, YOU will do that for yourself. this app is a tool for those who are willing to do the work to get themselves together. no app will sprinkle magical fairy dust on you. this app is simply a new brush for you, the artist. i wish you guidanceüôèüòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the application for sure üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"today I woke early I could do something worthy and i fid enjoy myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"An absolute scam - took an inappropriate payment then refused to repay. If I could give no stars, I would have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Zajebista apka motywuje i ≈ºeczywiscie dzia≈Ça."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"useful to remove unnecessary habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"they charged me 55$ just for installing the app. update: it has been almost 2 months and their customer service still hasn't even responded after numerous attempts at contacting them. What a joke."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. I am really loving it. I only wish it didn't beg me to share my journey with people everyday. I know they need customers, but maybe if it was only once a week and not every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic App!!! It has helped me so much it's only been a week. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to develop healthier behaviours and a happier life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is simple yet powerful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Although the app looks absolutely amazing, I've been charged but my Playstore account still shows that I'm not on the premium membership. I've tried to communicate with their bot, Amber, sent a ticket asking for them to resolve and emailed. No response yet. It's not a cheap annual membership so I'd expect a lot better costumer care. Subscribe with care!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING THIS IS A SCAM!!! Overall terrible app. Makes my alarm clock go off randomly. Charges me for premium that I never asked for/ didn't want AND YOU CANNOT CANCEL IN THE APP There's nothing beneficial to it. Happily uninstalling. Don't ever give them any of your information they will sell it, and they will also hold your money hostage. Report this to Google play!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Appears to be a good concept but I grew tired of the constant attempts to get me to subscribe without even having used it for more than a day yet. Seriously, guys, too much. BTW, don't subscribe right away as they will email you better offers than they offer you via the app. Not impressed with the deceit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Parece maravilhoso, mas infelizmente √© muito ingl√™s e eu sou apenas iniciante... Acaba qualquer prop√≥sito que o app possa me entregar, s√≥ por esse problema... Assim que disponibilizar a vers√£o para portugu√™s, eu instalo novamente."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really makes me feel positive about accomplishing the little things. It makes me feel like I am slowly but surely improving myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to get your life on track. V"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The best. Update the songs though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app its just amazing! I started with no motivation, but it has so many options and creative things that it makes me want to do everything! It's boosted my confidence a lot! I recommend it 1000/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The App is great and really helping...but how do i change my profile picture, I haven't upgraded it so does that mean I can't change my profile picture."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great so far, but I need more aggressive reminders!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app act as your mentor. Everything in this app is superb. I started feeling difference within first 3-4 days ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam, they will take your money. I created an account as part of a free trial and very quickly released this app was not for me. Unfortunately, after hours spent trying to cancel my subscription and contacting the Fabulous support team, I found I was not able to cancel and was charged $70AUD for an app I don't use. My subscription is still active and there is nothing I can do except report to my bank and try to block any charges. Do not give them your bank details!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel i love myself annnd my dear family members more than before‚ù§üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could rate thos zero stars I would. For over a month their ""customer service"" has been unable to help me locate my account. Insisting I must not have one, yet I was charged for premium features which I have been unable to use as no ""account"" can be located. How does that make sense? In addition customer service continuously send the same ""troubleshooting"" steps. I need help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam Artists! They offer a free 7 day trial but make it nearly impossible to cancel it! You can't cancel through the app you have to do it through their website which isn't mentioned any where on the app. I found it through a Google search. I then canceled my subscription well before my trial ended and then noticed they charged me any ways so I go back to the website and it shows my subscription is active. Refund my money!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Annoying notifications, no actual planners or customization like in ads, condescending language and affirmations, anything in the app takes 5 minutes, and is extremely difficult to cancel my trial before I get charged $40 for a glorified reminder to drink water in the morning. Pretty sure this is just a scam that was fleshed out a little bit more. Do I have to call to get this cancelled? It doesn't even show up as an active subscription in Google play. No email, nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me for a yearly subscription even though I cancelled the free trial on time! And now it says that I don't even have an account with this email. Not so fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As expected, too many notifications without options to turn them off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its very beautifully designed and makes habit building like a game. The dopamine spark from completing tasks and seeing the happy star is so wholesome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"theres WAY too much going on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Ok functions but VERY unethical pushy sales. Even after buying the app it tries to make you feel good by buy stuff, promoting their app. Really shameful. For instance it says "" why dont you send a message of gratitude this morning to your friends?"" And creates the message talking about how to get this app oh and btw i am grateful for the friends i send the message to"" there is no spirit of helping in this app, albeit with good features. There is a spirit to maximize profit by manipulating you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've been on the app for a little over two weeks. I like it so far, though I keep forgetting to click on what I've been doing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Damn, I teared up when I read the message from the ""future me"". I'm gonna buy it for sure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant app in encouraging peace of mind and mindfulness"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super helpful so far and actually in line with la lot of my therapy advice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good for issuing simple things at first and using words like ritual to build a sense of respect for your routines you're building."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its ssooo goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Literally very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only just begun using the app, but it is encouraging and uplifting. Further review to come."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is greaaaat! It just needs more challenges and maybe new things you can add to your routine, it would also be nice to have the app read more stuff out for you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think this os a great way to take control of things in your life.Personally I love the app so far.Would be a little better though if it kinda had more options"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app, thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware! I had signed up for a trial but ultimately canceled it. Imagine my surprise when I am charged a year subscription. I contacted support and was informed I did not cancel my trial correctly. I had canceled through my listed subscriptions on the play store as that is how I did all my subscriptions but apparently I also needed to cancel it through the web. Not only was I advised of this, but I was also told I will not be getting a refund. Absolutely ridiculous. Poor customer service."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seems like a great idea, I've had trouble following it. That's not a knock on the app though, my review is solely because you cannot manage subscription in app, and the website doesn't allow me to sign in through my Google account so I cannot manage the subscription without signing in on a computer. Edit - can't sign in to my account on desktop with Google. Do not sign up for this service. Cancelling your subscription is a nightmare"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the way habits work and they definately would have helped me had this app not been so cluttered and spammed notifications. I wanted to like this app after hearing good things but user interface just isn't all that friendly. It felt too cluttered and hard to navigate. Too many notifications cluttering my phone and it just felt really messy compared to other similar apps that have more simplistic and better designs. Could be a good app, but design is not good and too frustrating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Yet another app that expects full payment before you know what you're paying for. The trial version has literally nothing inside. Why not give me 3 days full trial? I cannot for the life of me fathom. This current model makes me walk away. I will never pay a year's subscription without knowing what I'm paying for. I'm not THAT un-fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"what the hell...there was auto subscription without my knowledge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This thing can change your life for the better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Too expensive, great resource but too rich for my taste just to organize my life. I can motivate myself but the app gets you engaged wanting to come back. Unfortunately $40 base plan and a $50 add on plan is for people with more money than I have for something like this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like that is changing my focus to more productive things in my life and the notifications are a great push to achieve what I want to do in that day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Def helps keep u on track i love the reminders as that's the reason I can't stay on track I forget."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Am enjoying using the app. It is helping in changing my habits from destructive to more self building ones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not bad, but it can be better + we need dark theme my eyes are burning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gud loved it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Works great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was not pleased to be billed without warning for the premium features. The refund process for this is not very easy either. I could not get a refund. Fabulous tells me to go to Google for the refund and Google doesn't have a record of payment that was made through the app. I lost $40. Disgusted with how Fabulous robbed me. The reply to this isn't helpful either. Their auto ""Contact Us"" bot just tells me to go to Google for the refund. Still no real person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best app, there is many habits, coachings,And for every habits like exercising there is many workouts ,meditation to storys everything is here, but the only problem is this is paid but you still enjoy the 7day free trail :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When I drop my guard, and allow for myself to go on this journey, I find myself happier. The writers of this are very nice and it allows me to treat myself better than I have before. My small goals matter, and I can finally start to achieve good habits. I have started with water in the morning, and now food. Thank you to the creators of this app for helping myself love."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazingggggg!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This apps make me more productive and I very happy for what has made me change. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cool app. But you need a subscription. Oh and BTW, the art inside it is fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I liked it but all the ads are really annoying. Ask me for money once I'm Fabulous. The reason I need this app is cos I'm broke and sad!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really love the daily coaching and reminders to take better care of myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why does it need my fingerprint? I never even made it all the way into the app. It seems very odd needing that much identification information. It also seems real odd that they want a detail copy of your finger print before you start. Idk that they habe malicious intents with my data, but there is no reason this kind of app should need that much info on people unless they plan to use or sell it in a concerning way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very in depth app to help you become a better version of yourself based on goals and criteria YOU set."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The idea and concept behind this app are actually good. But the result is a quite confusing app design. But that's something one could adept to and live with after some time. BUT: carefully think about if you really want to register your data with them since they will start bombing you with annoying spam mail and loads of push notifications. I'm still trying to minimize and get rid of these messages. App. Uninstalled."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"What an inspiring and delightful little app! It has surprisingly made a huge impact in my life and helps me a lot more than expected. Great for people who struggle with ADHD and/or depression, as it motivates the user to actually complete and report on the completed task, which coaxes them to actually ENJOY (what I never thought was possible for me) the process and notice their experience. Two thumbs up! Only drawback? Premium content is paid and money has yet to fruit off of trees. Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app, it really works."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW I DESPERATELY NEEDED AN APP LIKE THIS. It's got a lot of soul depth to it, which makes it completely relatable and motivating. The coaching is LIFE CHANGING!!! I've learned so much from this app. Thank you to the creators and to whomever contributed to this app. Thank you for making it possible. I deeply love it. THIS IS AN HONEST TO GOD TRUTHFUL REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE GET THE PREMIUM!! INVEST IN YOURSELF!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is one of the lowest 'marketing' campaigns I've ever seen. The landing page shows you are paying $0 for 450 days. Paraphrasing: ""You'll have 450 days to see how the app works after that you will pay X amount for yearly subscription"". Another part of the page says, subscribe to see your plan. You then receive a bill showing how you paid a yearly sub + a whole magnificent 450 days to start a free trial (7 days). This is not marketing, this is lying to steal. A complete lack of transparency."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only 6 days in, so take it with a grain of salt, but this app seems like it will really help me create effective habits to live a better life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I haven't used the app for a full week yet, but it has been very interesting! I thought it was just going to be a cute ""to-do list"" kind of app, but it turns out that it's so much more. It makes me think of how people describe ""Noom""; but instead of weight loss, it's for your mentality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The look of this app makes you feel excited to start something new and then SLAP! Fabulous Daily Routine starts promoting & annoying me to PAY for an app I've only played with for 5 minutes! Maybe 5 minutes! Being a potential customer, paying customer, it would work better to let me enjoy the app first, and let ME want and need to purchase this app! Disappointment at its finest, pressure is the fastest way to turn me off. Find a friend to text and set goals with, they are normally free!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me motivated!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled my trial over a month ago, woke up to a $40 charge today for no reason. Need a refund asap."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After using this app my life is just like changed thanks for this app but this should also have free things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic reminders to get you back to your journey of self awareness and the fact that what you do each and everyday matters.... Love yourself some more and don't take yourself too seriously.....life happens for us ‚ú®Ô∏è üíñ ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been incredible. I've accomplished things I never thought I could do, and I am physically and mentally way more healthy. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I expected motivational and inspiring quotes not a focus on my first 3 days to be drink water. Very dull and completely off putting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app for teenagers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wish there was more customization (if you manually add a task to a routine it HAS to have a timer assigned, even if it's just ""turn off conputer."" Like what? One second?) I also wish that you could add your own additional routines. For me, my routines would be: Wake up Workday Arriving home And lastly, bedtime routine. But because of how the app operates, it doesn't give me this option, so does my ""not bed time but trying to be contructive"" period have to be my workday routine?? :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I don't like how much it keeps me on the app when I am trying to put the phone down & be more productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a life changer. I highly recommend it for anyone who's wanting change, it's nearly designed and just amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Notion Automation no longer needed. Alhamdoulilah...Such a blessing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally wonderfulü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app would be better if it wasn't annoyingly switching my goals and starting over. I keep loosing progress because it has pop ups for different journeys. I regret buying this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"In one week. I decided to pay the $40 for the year and see what this app can help me accomplish. I like how it gradually introduces more things based on me accomplishing a certian amount of habits. I didn't know they have workouts included. Excited to see what this is all about."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's pretty cool the only problem I have is having to pay for my mental state to improve but other than that I really do enjoy this app I just wish I could have the other options on it ; I do kind of understand why they ask us to pay. Overall great app and I personally find it to be very helpful so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly really helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I can't edit my profile"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wanted to try for a week like they offer but it said I wasn't eligible and that I'd have to pay 40 dollars up front for the free trial. So sad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Literally stole my money by confusing deals and advertisements and now don't even respond to my support messages where I wanted to be explained what I bought. This is basically Scam, that will try to sell your things you will never need"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it best app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really well designed app based on behavioral science. Kudos to the research and development team and the scientists behind it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"PLEASE don't install! It doesn't deliver and the developer's replies to other comments like mine are just ""you can opt for the free trial"". The free trial is still only free for 7 days. I wish I had more space to write and explain but it's definitly some sort of scam. I tried to unsubscribe but everything I tried failed. I spoke to a bot, put in a case, clicked the unsubscribe button, emailed, followed all the steps and after being told that it's done - money leaves my account. It's defo a scam!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm so happy for this app it has helped me in so many ways. Thank you all for a wonderful app. I am growing ‚ò∫ and Development new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Recently resubscribe because I wanted the general food habit stuff, but when I found out they had Stoic Journeys as well I was extremely satisfied with my purchase."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's changing my perspective, I love this app so much!!!! It's amazing!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a great app now I can focus on myself moreüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for a 7 day trial and it billed me $62AUD straight away even though it said I wouldn't be billed until after the 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self improvement highly recomended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is saving my life, I have ADHD and Fabulous is like a little friend reminding me gently about the things that I wanted to get done. My mind is positively being rewired to start and repeat daily habits,this is where I struggle. I feel hope for my future with this app. Amazing !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was/ still am really struggling with self sabotage but I've found with this app it has given me reasons to start new habits and new realise how easy I can be to actually lock in a new habit. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really takes baby steps and is not overwhelming. Great customer service as well."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app for good reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping to streamline my habits and routines. I just wish there was a way to adjust previous days when I have forgotten to log the habit I did accomplish. It forces you to be a little to attached to your device."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the self paced and judgement free improvement guides"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helping me improve in life and focusing on my goals ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app pushed my friend to ending their life. Do not download this app, it will destroy your life. They constantly harass you & put you down everyday. Customer support just laughs at you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just loving the features..The sound within app seems all magical..The circles are the best place where I could find people as ambitious as me .. The vibration it all creates is so peaceful, self- growing sense pumps my boby high in air!! Thanks for such a wonderful application!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the reminders , gives you time to think about yourself. How you take yourself as an individual . Best part is learning something about yourself that you never even knew it existed and your capabilities will blow you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had downloaded Fabulous for several months before I was ready to really try and utilize it. It sat on my screen, would occasionally ask me if I wanted to use it. I would ignore it and it politely waited until I was ready. I have been using it for a month now and it has really transformed my days and my inner dialogue. I have mastered habits that have eluded me my whole life. I am a morning person. I can be organized. I can be motivated to work out. If you are ready, Fabulous can help you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"fatal glitch with the text not loading"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP! Simple, easy to use, and great at helping change habits and create new ones!! Definitely highly recommend!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"An app with great input to the user and much thought put behind its creation. Too much graphic and animation for my taste, but my main issue is the challenges that seem a bit off for a busy person, in it that it is not tailored towards custom goals. The challenges will consume time for a busy person that wants to plan and order its busy day and got through with the plan. The challenges do however structure and try to create a habit, but I would wanted to input my own goals and see those get done"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Does not mentions it is paid until it collects your personal info like your name, issues, and email."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has really been helping me harness my habits. I definitely recommend üòá"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Would give 6 stars out of 5, incredible worth of any money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Navigation sucks. When you set up your account on a new device you are FORCED to go through the process of answering question that you have already answered before you are given the option to open and restore your account information. VERY VERY FRUSTRATING."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really help me to be better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Not kern on having yo pay so using free options for now. Will review later when I have done more challenges. For now I like the design and the ideas"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Legit stuff ü§ò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps with my journey with recovery"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So worth it lost 18 pounds, more energy, better life. Not entirely thanks to fabulous but it played a key role"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful features MR/MIS fabulous team keep growing üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Forced to introduce your card number even if you just want to try the app for one week. Not interested."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've recommended this app to so many people! It helps me stay focused on the things that matter."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The first three days, it's prompting me to start a new habit for something that has already been a habit of mine for many years. Surely this app should check instead of just assuming that you don't already do it? So, that's three days that I can't use the app usefully. The next problem is so many notifications! One of them is late at night, which woke me up (when one of my problems is sleeping; go figure!). This is not a friendly app. Uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not fabulous at all. Very spammy and intrusive. Doesn't give reminder consistently. Always sending long articles in notifications that are just sales pitch for personal coaching. Doesn't build up on first action as promised in the description. The science behind this is solid but the execution is totally commercial and useless. I kept it so long only to write the review then I am uninstalling it. What a waste of a great concept."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Experience is mind blowing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great way to ease in some healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"easy start"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience so far üëåüèª üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to find motivation and make new habits stick"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware, they are shady. Refuses to refund an accidental subscription charge. Never notifies of upcoming charges nor of charges after they occur. They silently drain your bank account. They do not notify you of upcoming charges or even after charges occur, I discovered this by monitoring my credit card statements. I contacted support and they refused to offer a refund even though I haven't used the app or received any communications from them in the past 9 months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really a good app it's help me to be more focused and make positive energy and choices"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"There is limited customization to routines, and half of them are guided in-app (I want to do my own workout routine, for example). Not what I thought it would be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've completed my first week using this, and, while the steps seem minuscule while you're doing them, they do indeed set you up for success. Today, for the first time in many years, I've completed a daunting weekly task right away, rather than procrastinating until it can't be done. My suggestion: get premium at the lower price while you can. It becomes MUCH more expensive, and I regret my ""I'll see how it does"" thought process when I began. I can't afford the higher price, and it makes me sad."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got the app, had a look at the intro and didn't proceed as it asked me to pay. Then 1 week later unknowingly got charged $62. I have not created any profiles nor authorized any subscription. When I checked my profile it even asked me to sign in or link an account. Very upsetting that this app unsolicitedly subscribed you to their premium service and take your money. Be careful everyone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am 1 week in and feeling more motivated already. Small changes at a time unstead of trying to change everything at once"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app might be good for you. I recommend only signing up if you actually intend to use it for a year. I didn't want to continue using it. I canceled my trial a day before it ended. I got a charge for a year of premium a week after canceling. It's difficult it ask for a refund. I was denied for it being more than 48 hours after the charge. I sent a support email explaining what was happening. Its been two weeks since I sent it. No response, no refund. Very unhappy with the service for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Blissed out by the attention to detail and careful thought that's gone into creating The Fabulous. I can't begin to describe the powerful impact it is having on my life. It's really lovely!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Help full"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have paid for a premium subscription but I am unable to use it because the app wouldn't let me access any of the premium features. My subscription is still valid until April 2023, I have sent a couple of emails asking for support, no reply from the ""support team"". Unable to use the Premium app for more than a week now, very frustrating and disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Loved the concept of this app, but it wasn't what I needed. I did love the positive affirmations that came through in my daily notifications: sometimes those alone can serve a lot of reassurance and motivation in dark times. (Updated review)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a wonderful app that make us more happier‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the free trial, then it asked for questions about my areas of improvement, after which it gave me choices of amounts I wanted to pay (despite this still being the ""free"" trial). So I pressed $1, which it charged me without giving me the so-called ""Plan."" So I forgot all about it until the lapse of the 7 days, after which it charged me $40 for Premium membership! I thought, ok maybe it was my fault for not cancelling, so I downloaded the app. Then nothing. No plan, no motivation. A scam!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A nice way to guide us with the best company, ourselves"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Disappointing, every other click wants you to sign up for a subscription... and we all know what that means. Read the rest of the reviews. I need to go and pee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've sent 3 emails, no response, signed up for 30 day free trial from email and now that they have my card number, I still don't have the premium edition, they won't respond. Don't do it!!! You want an updated review, fix my problem!!! I haven't received anything from you other then you've been busy, blah, blah, blah. Fix my problem, then I'll update, not until then. 1 STAR!!!!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF...DO NOT DOWNLOAD...FRAUD I canceled this and it didn't appear under my subscriptions so It was taken care of but I was still charged even though I haven't used it. Bc the charge only appeared today but was charged on the 7th, when I was in the hospital, so don't download this or use the free trial, they will find a way to still take your money. It was the last 40 dollars I have and I did everything I was suppose to to keep this from happening"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the concept of the app, also the reminder to stay on task is awesome for people with ADD and have a bad habit of forgetting the simple things. Great app guys."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very encouraging still learning this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't know why it says in app purchases like it's an option... It's a mandatory subscription. Just another money grabbing app. Deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice when it was free! Next!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Never been able to set proper routines. In just the first week I'm excited to get out of bed and do what I need and want to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Llevo 3 d√≠as en la app y me parece asombrosa la manera en que me motiva, es muy buena app, pero de coraz√≥n quisiera que o fuera gratis o que no me estuvieran saltando publicidad para comprar la versi√≥n de paga a cada rato, s√≥lo por eso 4 estrellas"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving all in this app. Try it, write all and go for your goals!! Thanks to all creators ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating, whimsical, honest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started using Fabulous less than two weeks ago. Although some of the starting habits were things i was already doing everyday. It was nice having what i felt was an easier start because of this. Ultimately, it's nice to complete my daily routines, as outlined in the app...at the end of the day, if my inner voice is trying to get the best of me by telling me i wasn't productive enough; knowing that i completed the things I've committed to on the app, helps to quiet that inner dialogue a bit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good worth spending money on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful, healthy reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Finding it super useful to establish healthy habits. Moves at your pace rather than heaping lots of unrealistic goals on you and has an encouraging and laid back feel to the whole app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Please make the video graphics good Because of 360p graphics I feel average"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it's so cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The SM ad showed choosing you morning routine using a flow chart and that's what I wanted but not what I got. Editing to add... Don't listen to the developer here... They are literally copying and pasting the same few replies to every negative review. It's clear their customer service is lacking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's peaceful and slow paced but I really felt alot better even on the 1st day. It feels like you are making time for yourself and your wellbeing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tanks very much I love dis app y expectacul"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app for routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you are truly committed to wanting a change, this app is a great starting point. Moreover, buy premium! Investing money makes you want to get your money's worth out of it, so you will be more likely to actually change habits! This worked on me and I am indeed living healthier mentally and physically."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"FRAUD APP THEY CHARGE YOU 39.99‚Ç¨ ON YOUR CREDIT CARD EVEN IF YOU JUST GET THE FREE 3 DAY TRIAL..LOOK AT THE REVIEWS ON GOOGLE Before even downloading it!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just as it's name ..Fabulous..please try it.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"the app aesthetic is cute and it doesn't disappoint me at all. it's amazing ^‚Å†_‚Å†^"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asking for credit card information for a free trial, yeah piss off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you're going to give a 7-Day trial, give a 7-Day trial without obligation of a credit card. I don't trust anybody who forces me to give a credit card at the get-go. My suggestion? Give 3-day trial that's actually a 3-day no obligation trial, and then start bombarding people with a need for a credit card. If your app is so good, then people are going to want to commit. As of now, bye-bye uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only on trial so far it's been amazing. I'm usually all or nothing and this app is helping me be more mindful about small steps towards my goals üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is what Apps should be: helpful, interesting, fun, and practical. I just started the journey (to start healthy habits that lead to more energy) but have had my expectations met so far (2015). Update: 2022 In seven years it has really improved in quality as well as marketing to get more people to try it. I do wish there were more quotes from every religion not only Eastern mystics but all in all lol I'd recommend it. The world is full of great religious quotes from all faiths."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes tracking my routines very easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the stories that appear when I complete all the tasks for the day. Honestly, I get through everything so I can see those animations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm having issues with the membership üòê it has been more than 7 days and some features are still locked"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am beginning my healthy living journey! This app is helping me set goals and remind me of important habits I am forming in my life. These are becoming my life living goals. Thank you for this support!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app fo habits I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app so far. I used it years ago and never used premium, and now I'm using premium and the app has grown so much since I last used it (2018)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"gute Idee und gute Umsetzung bis auf die fehlende Synchronisation zwischen mehreren Ger√§ten. Eine Web-Version w√§re auch sch√∂n..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Attempted to cancel the subscription within the 7 days and it didn't work. Not happy with how difficult it is to cancel. Take money from my account which I didn't want to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is keeping me hydrated and happy. I've lost many friends due to anger outbursts. Fabulous has kept me happy, hydrated, and full of energy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pay to add personalized things you have to do in a day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's great love the support and everything I have learned from the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Definitely a scam! They charged 39.99 USD from my account for Premium Subscription and guess what? I cannot even use this subscription,it says ""No subscription found"".I tried to contact them several times and I am always getting the same automatic message that someone from Customer Service will contact me. There is no way to get in touch with someone real. I would give them 0 stars if possible!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Niiiicee"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app appreciate for the efforts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Day 3 and am enjoying the encouragement and reminder to drink water. The stretch routine so far is a good challenge for me thus far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still remembered this thing in 2021. That's what changed me. At that time, I was just laying one the bed. My stomach felt hurt when I sit or stand still. I was on a bad habit for almost half a year. And so, I decided to change with watching YouTube to form a healthy habits but it didn't help. Then finally, I've download this app. Its help me change my bad habits. Thanks for the help.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not so FREE trial. You have to enter payment information before you can really do anything in the app under the ""7 day FREE trial"". Good luck trying to cancel before the week is up. I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to cancel only to end up being charged for the subscription I didn't want ($40). It feels like a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dissapointed! I paid for the premium subscription in the first week. After the 7 days trial, money were taken again from my account, I requested a refund, which I received, but now I don't have a premium subscription anymore, even though I paid for it. No answer on any of their suggested channels. Why should I recommend something when the customer service is non-existing?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I badly needed something to help me start building positive habits in a sustainable way, and I couldn't believe it when I stumbled upon this app. It is slowly and consistently helping me to change my life, it's really enjoyable and I've also learned a lot. It's comforting knowing that it's based on science too. Only criticism I'd have is that if doesn't allow you to include habits that aren't daily. That's the difference for me between four and five stars. But I'd highly recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it... but I wish the features of premium membership should be in the normal .. maybe just a few like I can't add.more than 4-5 habits in my routines . I can't take the coaching in the app. As a user of it for over some time I would recommend it... but I hope the management team might consider the above... 4 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is great I feel better day by day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for forming habits, starting with the basics of drinking water, to finding your life's purpose, best I've found."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is just an amazing app. It starts small but soon you become a habit master. I bought the premium version but only after completing the first journey and realizing how amazing the app truly was."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Problematic service, would be warned about payment problems.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice app üëå üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a nice app keep us motivated but sometimes it's just like a app in corner that hasn't been used from months but is you make it regular it is a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash app. Essentially you get charged so that it can remind you about things. Also, this app exists only to lower you into a trial and then charge you when you're not looking. Everything is non-refundable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It truly is changing my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They made you subscribe for a free trial telling you that you won't be charged if you cancel befor the trial ends,but when you want to cancel you can't find a unsubscribe link or something and the ""contact us"" section will never do theyr job. I want a refund but no one is answering"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Great for building healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I dont like app where even bofore i take grasp on app I am imediatly bombarded with payment screen. Its bad UX and feels like app is money grab. Deleting right away, maybe app is good, but we will never know ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far! I haven't had to deal with customer service yet. Apparently that's been a gripe for some people. I find the app easy to use. I love the guided meditations. Excited to keep using it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing! I now have much more motivation for things!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a really good app but they need to make it a little more simpler"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the positive reinforcement and self discovery each day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is working miracles for me so far, 2 weeks in and the, slow start with continuous gentle encouragement & prodding support have been huge for me. I really underestimated how important it is to not rush the process, and start with small steps. They started me drinking water every morning, and then layered that with the education behind it, and then added what to eat for brekkie with the 411 behind it as well. My only gripe is the UX/UI of the app to navigate completing tasks gets confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel better after using this app. I feel my confidence grow up . I feel so confident and satisfied"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good! A few too many notifications and they don't warn you when your trial is over but it has a gotten a few habits started for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love Fabulous it is so productive and healthy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A big help to my mental health, I appreciate that it takes it slow to crawl up to more life affirmation. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Keeps me in check with reminders/alarms. Good habits to have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Glorified notification reminder app with a very confusing UI. Can't tell if there are actually 2 subscriptions, it shows $40/yr with the 7 day trial when you sign up, and that one is called your routine planner subscription, but then you're served an ad for their premium subscription at ""half off"" which is $50/yr. After watching that ad and NOT subscribing, it started to tell me I had a Premium subscription. The motivation is very vague, I didn't find it helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's prime is high for a middle class ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è All the features is in prime membership only As the challenge goes on its make you elation It is good daily habitual application,and this application is classified on your attitude and attention i liked it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app for self improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Terrific app, seriously you should try it, it helps you build habits and most important to celebrate each little - big step you make. Everytime I use this app only gets better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app. I don't know why but with this app I can easily do my tasks on the morning and I love that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Right off the bat it's annoying. Can we disable the obnoxious chiming when the app is opened?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled subscription through the app during the trial before deleting the app, and was subsequently charged one month later. Tried to dispute this through PayPal as the product has not been used and was believed to have been cancelled fully, but was advised that the refund had been rejected by the seller. Advise to be careful if signing up for a trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Didn't think about it at first. But this app is actually smthing rlly good. It actually did help me a lot, i do recommend downloading it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the animation and the fact that this habit formation apps is backed by science, I have a 100% confidence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying it and the progress it's helping me achieve"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lovely and inspiring app. A joy to open each day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It has great potential. What it could be better is the notifications' management. Things get over my screen suddenly, happens rarely when I have to write messages. But Ott, that's an excellent app I recommend üëçüèªüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for building habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a very fantastic app I've used so far to look upto my daily tasks and routine. Only thing that I'm not satisfied is the alarm. It doesn't ring at all. I request to the developer of fabulous to plese look up to it and fix the bug."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, I can see how it could help me develop better habits. Now if it could just make me more consistent üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM!!!! BE AWARE!!! Later Edit: i have renounced to the subscription in June 2022 and deleted my bank/card details IN JUNE 2022 and today, 3 OCT 2022, 39.99 dollars were extracted from my bank account. I DEMAND REFUND & EXPLANATIONS!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous gives people a new chace to become a better person physically and mentally"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great Reminder App! I love the ease of use. The best part is every habit they suggest or offer, they provide a resource to get it done. You don't have to go looking for meditations or exercise. It's all right in the app. I am doing better with my habits due to their simple reminders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very well done, helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So I don't know exactly what happened, I used a discount for my annual subscription, the payment was taken from my bank account but when I tried to sign into the app via my phone, I was being asked to pay again for a premium subscription...as I did not want to pay twice for the same service, I have now cancelled my subscription. This is very disappointing to say the least..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"nothing but a garbage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so fun to have this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Outstanding app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome just started using it. So far so good."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really good app helps me to get dehydrated by 7am every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a week and I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app to get into a daily routine. Also, provides some good advice on other areas such as anxiety and self-confidence through community circles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is not bad and it can be useful if configured correctly. What bothered me is being forced to give my credit card and then not being able to manage my membership from the application. I don't enjoy the idea of money being automatically redrawn without being asked. There are a lot of friendly apps that ask you if you want to continue the membership. Anyway, in the end it wasn't so difficult discontinuing my membership but I dit have to read in the other comments the internet address."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't download. It asks your most personal questions, gets you to commit, they says ""Ok, you get 7days free enter your card"" right after. 3.33‚Ç¨ a month. Then sells that to the algorithm no doubt. Hey maybe I can use ""free Spotify"" now. Rofl üòÇü§£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me again!!! I cancelled my subscription after I had a year membership. Cancelled it in August, why do I get suddenly charged again out of the blue?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been helped by the Fabulous work very much. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you dont cancel before renewel date then dont bother trying to contact them for a refund. Theyll keep your money and not help. Literally sent me to a page that pretty much just says dont both contacting us again, we wont give you back the money. They didnt remind about the upcomming date which is funny considering I got the app because I was forgetful and have ADHD and frequently forget dates/times/etc. Trash."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying the app, but all of a sudden the fabulous central and circles posts disappeared. I looked forward to reading those everyday and now they're gone. How do I get those back?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's okay. Not the best. The animations and silly rhyming videos are annoying, but it is helping me develop better habits, so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice to build any habbit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An amazing transformation experience. I have nove love myself so much as after using this. Thanks for realising me my value"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I lost my phone and bought a new one, I try signing in into my old account and it shows that I don't have a previous purchase of premium. I lost my premium membership and have to buy it again. I even have the play order receipt."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Delete all your social media and replace it with this app for 1 week. I double dog dare you. You might just find happiness"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"graphics are really simplistic and clear and i feel motivated to change my habita"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very enjoyable journey with Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever, feel like a trap, super long unskippable animations and forced tutorials, nothing is free and they billed me a 39.99 full month after cancelled my 7 day free trial immediately in play store that I was forced to accept. You can't choose path, all stupid habits is pre created by them. After my refund request, they just never contacted me again. I will just open a chargeback case. Disgusting to put stress and financial issues for ppl who already struggle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall good. It helped me focus on what I needed to start focusing. The reason why I stopped using it is because there's not an option for having weekends. I can't have the same routine every day of the week. You can't even go on vacation without losing all your progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is only my third day using the Fabulous Daily Routine app, but so far, so good. I like that it doesn't let me overwhelm myself with a huge list of things to do. It encourages one step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an great app for self growth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly... it is a really really helpful app. It is sort of a guideline for you if you want to make a new habit. Mao ra byerz"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has gotten me up and moving when nothing else could!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app so far, I just wish they had a computer compatible option because when I'm at work it would be easier to do the new coaching sessions from my computer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app automates a ""journey"" for you, adding daily habits to improve your well-being. Since I've already been doing some of these habits for some time, I realised it would take me more than 1 free week to make my mind up about the app. I activated a 30 day pass, to be told I was already registered. My bank account was charged ¬£35 after 7 days. I've been trying to contact the company since October 16th, via email and Facebook. This is a DEEPLY un-Fabulous experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice design, good ideas for motivation, includes simple and effective trainings for my my goal of excercise. I am beginner of creating new habits from zero level and it works! For now on I totally recommend it is very helpful for people who wants to set new achievements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was honestly skeptical about this app at first. I read the description and said ""Sure, okay. You promise a lot, let's see you deliver."" and as I said that I thought to myself ""I'll have dropped this app in three days..."" Well it's been well over three days and I'm still here. I'm drinking water every morning! I EXERCISE! And I do it EVERY MORNING AT 6! Who does that? Who gets up at 5:30 excited for exercise at 6? Apparently I do and that is just the start! Try it! It really works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app for setting good behaviour patterns!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DO THE FREE TRIAL FOR THIS APP. DESPITE CANCELING WELL BEFORE THE DEADLINE THEY WILL STILL CHARGE YOU. And the app itself is awful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice work here it's so overwhelming as a good thing and is like they can feel my problems and provide great solutions to them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far, great ideas to help with progress. I wish the guides had a skip button instead of listening to it all over again if you accidentally shut it down."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is really great it's just so amazing, I was amazed to see how beautifully the app works satisfied with app.. üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled this app and then they charged my credit card twice. I was able to flag the charges with my credit card company. Now a year later, they have tried charging my card again when I am not subscribed to the app. Very shady! Update: Still trying to charge to my credit card. I am not subscribed to this app nor do I even have it downloaded on my phone. Beware of this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Completing somewhat my goals than normal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app would really benefit from understanding that many many people are forced into working shift work and do not have a regular wake up time. This app tries to force one into a cookie cutter routine during the day, but becomes useless if you are a shift worker that, out of your control, switches your days and nights frequently. For this app to be useful for me, I need it to be easy for me to switch from a day shift routine to a night shift routine and still get reward me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sketchy they don't manage your subscription through Google play. I thought I unsubscribed since I didn't see it on the Google play subscriptions on my account. Just got charged. Going to cancel my subscription asap...‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far!! Wel put together! East to navigate!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying this app it's very inspirational and a great motivator. Very easy to use. I've set up routines for morning, work time and bedtime. I recommend this the annual charge was $62"

If you face many problems regarding to do list is will help you guy. Thank you fabulous to change my life!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As the name suggests,it's a very fabulous app.In short it's a very good app it helps you manage yourself better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wasted time signing up only to be asked for my credit card number at the end"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app and it has really helped me create a routine for my mornings and evenings that aren't stressful. It took a while but fully committing to the guidance is what worked for me. I ONLY WISH IT HAD A PC APP! DX My computer is lackinggggg. But my phone suffices for now. Adding ""ToDoist"" works on my day to day. Integration with Todoist would be awesome. Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disappointed there is no basic free option. Not every can afford a yearly subscription fee, thus truly a barrier to low income families/people trying to improve their health and wellbeing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Update: I did renew past the trial! Still dont like that I cant manage the subscription directly in google.After the one crash,I gave the app permission to run in the background & display over other apps and that seems to help functionality.Still not very intuitive and could use some ui updates!Animation story doesnt always continue after completing tasks for a day, discover tab confusing,my water goal reset bc I started on a Saturday so it took me twice as long even tho I never missed a day,etc"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its simply a nice app. I can't afford most services but for beginners it's very helpful. It helps a person build a foundation for a focused clear mind I guess"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"it helped me through the first day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best in the category. It will make you definitely better than you were yesterday. It has every tool to transform your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's interesting so far. Only a few days in, but enjoyable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"[Update 29.10.22] I had given this app a 5 star but I have had issues with 3 failed charges for the full amount despite cancelling the first time which didn't seem to go through, then the 2nd time I did go for the ‚Ç¨2/mth offer which on my account now. I've submitted yet another support ticket but as someone who works with small businesses, delays responding to payment issues is critical! I hate doing this but it might just flag a response.If you are signing up for this app, use a disposable card"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for a week. At first I struggled with how to use it and would have liked a bit more guidance maybe in the form of a video. Maybe I just couldn't find it? Anyway, I am getting used to it now and can definitely see the benefits, especially the small target settings. It is already helping me with motivation. I also like the extra videos, suggestions and group input. I would recommend the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No ads, helps me keep track of my routine and makes my life better, it's as the title says üòâ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am so grateful for such a professional self help experience. I feel so loved,supported and well guided. I love the daily reflections, habit tasks and the entire set up and experience of the app. My mindset is challenged everyday. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"please make it free its a very good app ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Despite some of the options being blocked by the upgrade the app is usable and can be enjoyable without purchasing anything. I've actually made some progress with drinking water because of thisüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"so far I'm mainly frustrated from being forced to start from scratch and ""sign up"" when switching phones..... when I paid for a month trial ... i don't understand!!! where's my progress? the app seems to have managed to somehow have two profiles going for me on two phones and I'm already overwhelmed with keeping track of these new habits... lol. the graphics and storyline is beautiful, however.. love the extra science..it's also thoughtful to add many customizable layers to habit forming.tbc..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for 4 days and my habit changed! Super great apppp!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Accountability works for me. This app provides a self accountability tracker for a wide selection of activities and health matters. I've just started and I like it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My experience was awful. They double billed me and refused to refund immediately. After I escalated a PayPal claim they only refunded one of the two charges. Be very careful about giving these folks your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazingly individual whilst still feeling part of a like-minded community"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It so useful and well program"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. It's been really beneficial to my mental health. I've only had it for a couple weeks so I'm still learning all the features but there's much to explore. I definitely recommend it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Me encanta todo! Pero estar√≠a bueno que fuera un poco m√°s accesible en precio o en todo caso ganarse parte de las cosas completando desaf√≠os o cosas as√≠. Me gusta mucho la verdad, pero me siento incompleta al no poder realizar todas las cosas que la app tieneüíî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for slowly building habits and adding structure to your day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent! So far it's been effective for me where other electronic personal development and coaching platforms have not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well....this app is really very helpful I like it! It helps to be your real self. There are many challenges and habits you can include in your daily routine. But always be honest to yourself even while using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to use. Super helpful app for those who strive for success"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a fabulous way to develop habits that have evaded me my whole life. There is a lot of resources and i look forward to my daily and nightly check in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I decided to start Fabulous because I was diagnosed with ADHD, and hoped this can help develop better habits. After my second week, seems to be grear"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Can't describe how amazing it is!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Way too many notifications. It's more annoying than helpful. You're constantly bombarded with ""tips"" and ""articles"" that aren't really useful. The interface is filled with pop ups for different sections of itself, not a very good UI. Subscription isn't on Google Play, it's through their website. It was a mistake to try this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried to play bingo today and even though they accepted 4 deposit of ¬£20 now they question who I am.. you are a scammer I will stick with William Hill"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very hard to cancel subscription, ads talk of MBTI types and personalisation but then there's nothing like that in the app. It's also very hard to navigate. Would have given 3-4 stars but those scammy tactics and false advertising are absolutely unforgivable. Ended up paying like 33 pounds for something I barely used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seems amazing for now, I don't really understand why but this app seem to be able to hold me accountable really well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Reminds you to be your best self. Coaching levels for all personal challenges and a fun platform."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app has a bunch of depressed teenage kids posting things they shouldn't be. Fabulous was not was I was looking for so I deleted it. One year later they charge me again. I immediately emailed them to request a refund with details why I was cancelling, including that the app is completely useless. They responded by saying I had to fill a form out for a refund. When I filled out the form, it said it was more than 7 days since I was charged so no refund. What a load of bs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is more than I ever expected and exactly what I've been looking for.So far it is a very usefull guide and it helped me improve a lot allready. I absolutely love the fact that I can complete my journey even if I don't pay for premium(though I'm really considering it, seeing how good this app it is)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING. I used the app for less than an hour and cancelled the free trial on 19th October. Payment was taken on 26th October even though I cancelled and there is no subscription in my Google play account. Unacceptable behaviour, robbery"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soothing. I really enjoy the music, and so far, I'm enjoying everything about this app. I highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using the app a few days, but it's gently been motivating me to be consistent with the healthy habits I've already established, and to create new ones. I've decided to pay to keep it after the free trial. I really have needed some help with staying focused to complete a big project, and this is a great tool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Excited about upcoming updates also. Great team that know their customer base. Thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app I really love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been having great experiences with this app. It gave challenges that I wanted to face to strengthen my mind, and it's really understanding as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing life changing app that can help alter habits and patterns into a more self disciplined, health focused you! The reminders are all round effective. And the lessons are a gift. I love it. ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for morning kick start"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a newby, but this has the potential to be a game changer for me and the more fulfilling life I want to lead."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just down loaded and still trying to figure things out. But I like it it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thx!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a great momentum to starting any journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very interesting but easy approach to modify your habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful and exciting!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Non of any other apps has put this much great first impression on me, it's my first day and I'm curious to see my end result... üíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hang in for a bit and you will find ways to manage those habits you've always wanted to build in. Beautiful art and pleasing interface"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Completely PAID app. Just a money making business for d developers. 3500/ year. Are u kiding me?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cool concept, but there were far too many things to read, and super flowery language. Not a good fit for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Have been charged for a subscription without wanting one, and cannot get a refund. Can't contact anyone about this. Really unimpressed so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: reduced to one star because they've started advertising their subscription service in the middle of my routines. I tried The Fabulous last year and liked it, but it kept sending me emails so I uninstalled. Was so disappointed to discover that the journeys available last year were now locked. It won't let you uncheck habits if you check off tomorrow's routine by accident, which is very easy to do if you're a night owl as it will switch you to tomorrow automatically after 2am."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i had fun and way more productive than before. I am glad, found this app to improve myself more. The app is quite simple and easy to navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Credit card before seeing anything? Crazy stuff. EMail with an TLS error (invalid certificate) for an 30 days free trail? My Browser refused to show it. Instantly deinstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíØü§≤üéÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cool concept, but the app is so cluttered. There is so much going on in this app that it's annoying to try and do my checklist every day. Most of the content I don't look at and I don't want to see it. Just let me do my checklist."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely and complete app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disappointed only 1 week free installed and have to uninstall again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For now, it's helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pay pay pay... everything is trying to sell a plan. And makes very difficult to cancel the account. Which is very annoying üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The customer service on this app is god awful. For the hippy dippy nonsense the spout off in the app, they're quick to take your money but then when you need customer service they tell you ""we might get back to you in 10 days"". Well it's been 3 weeks since I put in my request for customer service and haven't heard anything. I think they need to hire a few more customer service reps lol...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesomeüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Opening issue,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Asome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spam, spam and more spam, account cannot be deleted, they just keep user data and they constantly send spam to email and push notifications"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The amount of notifications is UNBEARABLE. You get one every 10 minutes, what the.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't loged in the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm actually enjoying this app. And that's a lot from me. Still figuring everything out but it's really nice to take care of myself. I love the little stories and the design of the app is very interesting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is awesom üåüüåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"s√≥ n √© 5 estrelas pq pra conseguir a experi√™ncia completa precisa pagar"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"1) I wanted to know how to change the workday hours because it doesn't appear like you can. That seems like a massive oversight for people who have irregular schedules. When I opened a chat window it said it will take 10 days to respond! 2) I signed up yesterday for the offered free week trial then 1 year after. It went ahead and charged me the full year with no trial period."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful heart is filled with joy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After joining fabulous I really became so confident I am assuring you all you can abiously install this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used this app in July 2021, even bought the premium. App wasn't right for me so I cancelled the subscription and deleted the app (even I have paid for year, it was my mistake and ok). Today I've been charged 39.99 for premium even I can't find any subscription in Google play. I just can't understand because it's not even one year after my last paid subscription. I've never been using website and there was somehow new subscription which was charged today. So random. Please refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too pushy. Just let me explore the app... just going to uninstall and try something else."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This is an unfair review. App itself was alright, but boy was cancelling the subscription a challenge. I reinstalled and was FORCED through new account setup and all the long unskippable animations just to log in to access subscription settings. At which point I get bounced to a webpage with FOUR splash pages to entice you back in. The monetization strategy on this is just way too aggressive. Maybe it's worth it? Too turned off to try again. It's sketchy they don't manage sub through Google Play"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far has been a great experance, getting better and better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Have to pay yearly, which is definitely not my thing, but was helpful in giving reminders and encouragement for completing tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Positive a d encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a really good app, loving it. But I think their subscription charges are too much for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me a lot with centering and recalibration. However, I think it would be so helpful if you can add the Coaching sessions from the Discovery tab to your routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this. You get what you give. The app is a pleasant breath of fresh air. It has provided much needed focus. I'm on the free trial but I will be keeping its services permanently."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slow and steady steps. I can do this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work, I want my money and time back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful so far. Suffer from ADHD and this app seems to keep me somewhat focused on the day ahead of me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Allow me to try the app without having my credit card on file. Too many companies make it hard to cancel or something goes wong and I get charged when I wanted to cancel or I forget before time is up etc etc. You can easily do this with email verification alone. It goes from week trial to yearly subscription. Sorry going to skip this app based solely on this business model."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Optimistic - I'm using the trial period and after really sticking with the routine for a couple of days, I do find it easier to stay on track with my self care routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a good and useful application."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overall I did not care for it. I gave it a try for about a week, but the habits and consistency it called for were not engaging and did not work well with my nightshift lifestyle. -I found the interface annoying and distracting, sending multiple notifications over the day, sometimes multiple times in an hour. -You're locked into a year membership with signing up, with no refund option. -The amount of time watching unnecessary animations felt like time I could be being productive or resting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"0/10, would rather fight a honey badger."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a wonderful app one can use to improve him/her-self."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app use to be free with additional stuff costing... This isnt right. I dont have the money to be doing this sadly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have no idea if it's a good app or not because I deleted it immediately as it was super loud and annoying! Why would the devs make such an annoying start?!?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very friendly and motivating in a gentle way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It has a lot of potential and I believe it can help a lot of people. The amount of spam from this app is annoying. If the goal is to create structure and procrastinate less, sending so many notifications, buttons and bells that require attention is counterproductive. This app could be better by letting you customize exactly what kind of notifications you want to receive. Update: The amount of moderator notifications is absolutely retarded. Had to switch off notifications altogether!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great for self improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this app for 3 days, and it has inspired me to create new habits and has already begun to change my views of myself and my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Expensive and overwhelming. You are able to cancel a subscription but not before they charge your credit card without notification. It is then impossible to request a reversal. Beware!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had to uninstall as could only see options for questions I couldn't see"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoyed using this, very motivational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great it actually changed some of my bad habits into good and developed some more good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If followed through, it's actually very well structured, and impactful. Definitely Recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, sends reminders and tries to keep user accountable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So many notifications!!!!!! Way way way too many"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping you on track!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm liking it but the notifications are inconsistent and don't always appear, making it harder to use and create those habits. Not sure if I wanna pay with this in mind. Plus I have apps like plum that wish me things like happy birthday but nothing off Fabulous. Sad face"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is great start to get the basic habits right so you can work on the the larger more routed ones. Defiently worth while."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this is really helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Use a prepaid card!!! I canceled my subscription 7 months ago, only to have them continually charge me despite both emailing, ""removing"" card, and deleting account. They keep your information!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"CooL App, made me more organised then I was all ready"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"perfect@ iamcyusa_"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For an app about mental health they really love those predatory tactics to get money from you. I regret ever downloading the app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is awesome for best time planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unusable, something weird going on with the UI, the buttons show up but there were no words. Either white text on a white background or no words at all. Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Meilleur application du monde"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Muy buena la versi√≥n en ingl√©s pero deber√≠an tambi√©n mejorar la versi√≥n en espa√±ol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will take your personal info and then ask for payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unreasonably had to unsubscribe. You would expect mental health app to shy away from chaep tricks like that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps and easier to make habits.........;-')"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app if you are looking to accomplish goals this is the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful application.. Hoping to make the best of it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! I've been struggling with anxiety for so long and this app aids my journey on self growth and motivates me to become a better version of myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just finished my first challenge and it feels really good. After that this app is giving me next challenge to improve myself. The good part is, it is making it all easy. Thank you I hope I can make it. After improving myself I will again come to share my experience."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged twice and got refunded for 1 of them and they cancelled my premium features. I cannot access the premium features and payed $61 for nothing basically."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Using this in conjunction with medicine and talk therapy and finally making progress on my cptsd healing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I hate apps that gets you to fill everything and just before the start it suddenly want a payment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was having such a hard time building a stable daily routine. Thanks to this app, I now have a start and a direction of where I want my daily routine to go. I've only had this app for approximately 4 days and it has been such a great help already! I do believe the premium is worth the cost! I like how this app hold you responsible or accountable to follow through with your commitments! Thank you Fabulous dlDaily Routine!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am still on the 7-day free trial, but will definitely stick to this. This is insurmountably the best ADHD brain helper for having a routine, making a routine and keeping it. It is extremely satisfying to hit that check mark after completing a step and the lil' dings reminding you to stay on track is AWESOME! Only wish I could figure out how to occasionally skip parts of a routine if pressed for time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for those who wants to stop them self masturbating‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing to see here. Asks to pay, no customer support. Doesn't delete profile on request, i guess gdpr doesn't exist. :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love all the educational parts to it. I'm going to be using this for a long time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for behavioral changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving Fabulous, it is really helping me stick to my goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A great app for improving your life step by step üòç motivates me a lot to be consistent with my routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried the 1 week free didn't w9rk for me so when I went to cancel there was no way to. Playstore? Nope. In the app? Nope. Make it easier to find please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super great app, you still get full usage without premium, and it's a great way to build healthier habits without too much sudden change or pressure :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"$$$$poor experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An epic app that allows you to build a personal Weekly Planner for your basic needs to life skills and etc. It all starts with discipline and consistency."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app tells me to invite my friends 4 times a day (once after every routine). I regret paying money for this treatment. I am not your salesman. Give me an option to turn this of!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The graphics are really pretty and their words of encouragement really do wonders. I just love that they tell you what to do, step by step"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got charged by this app twice even though it's been deleted since the first day, it wasn't what was described at all and I did not agree to purchase it, it took 128AUD from my account when I have never used it. Even after cancelling, google cannot see that they took my money and yet I have a screenshot of it taking it twice on my bank statement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredibile"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Might be a great app but when I tired to cancel before the trial ended apparently there was an error. I was charged even though I never used the app and they refuse to give refunds"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've downloaded this app on and off but each time I felt like something was missing that I need. I redownloaded I again and I feel like they really restructured and added things in that cover my needs a lot better. I only wish there was a search button so I could find exact meditations or guides that I need if I'm experiencing a crisis moment. Like if I'm stressed I don't want to search through every guide that might help. It would also be nice to have more control over your personal program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has given me healthier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It helps me stay motivated!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful and well put together app that is motivating and encouraging. I will definitely continue to use this app while it helps me reach my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use no annoying adds simply the best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"In principle this is a great app. However, it's too intrusive. eg, when you open the app you get a clicky sound even when the phone volume is off, I assume they are using a notification sound to get round this but whatever it is its annoying and unnecessary. The notifications are too frequent and lead me to ignore them regularly, even with settings at the minimum it feels like the app won't leave me alone, yes you need a nudge for the app to work bit too many and people switch off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great go ahead for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Garbage. If you're going to design an app that's FREE to install but then completely prevents use until you pay a yearly subscription, you might as well charge them before the install. Funny how an app that credits itself for increasing productivity also gladly wastes your time. If you want to improve your life, the first thing you should do is not install this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is Amazing. I'm only on the 7 day free trial and loving and living it !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really easy to use and it's helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is no way you can cancel your membership! Can someone tell me how I can cancel my membership? the login page on the website does not let me to login to cancel my memebership. How can I cancel if I can't login????"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely amazing"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gamifies habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just awesome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to be able to try this without being obligated to start paying for it after a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it easy to implement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Makes you go through a bunch of questions and tasks only to tell you at the end that you need to buy premium to see the results or have a schedule made for you. This app isn't free. It's free to open but pay to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this app so far.. the price is right. I've only had 4 days but it is sure helping me set healthy habits and routine. Even something like remembering to drink water I can't do but this helps.. with everything love love love it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very interactive and motivational. Great job!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had used Fab since high school and it helped me alot in getting things done. l had stopped using it at one point for some reason and start seeking similar ones like this, but l always tend to go back to this app ^^. Great for fighting against procrastination and maintaining a productive schedule."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This really help me like A LOT!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating and amazing progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I tried this app for 2 years . It will not do magic to your life. It will just awaken the magic inside of you. And it your responsibility to use it upon your life the journey and daily coaching is always there. But the app will help you to jeep yourself accountable. Great and recommended. For those who really want to change and just need a guid how to ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Google isn't allowing me to sign in using my Google account. Error: it doesn't comply with Google's privacy policy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I gave my email before they tell I can't use the app without giving em my payment information as well. Idc if I can cancel anytime, it's not a free trial if I'm exchanging information for it. Information has value"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app that works for you and helps you but i didnt have the money to upgrade or would have"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interesting,fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I came across this app by chance and it has compelety transformed my way of thinking Building daily habits and creating a healthy lifestyle has really helped improve my mental health and is helping me create a more healthy way of living."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App sucks with notification. Could use a refresher on animation. Whole animation feels cheap. And lazy And I'm sure they earn good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As far as organizing and encouragement this app knows how to help you start to build your life in a more positive and structured kind of way. Needed a lil knudge into building healthy routines. This app did more that. I recommend this app for those that are looking an easy way to schedule and organize your life in a lazy way. Alot of timers and reminders without much writing and planning. üëçüèæüôèüèæüëçüèæ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have had the worst app experience ever with this app. There is no actual customer support, there is no clear way to unsubscribe from being charged, And once you are charged, there is no clear way to reach their support team other than through an AI bot. The bot unfortunately is not helpful in the above issues and it does enable you to send a message to their support team but you will never actually hear back from them. I also DMed them on Instagram and have had no reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Being asked to enter credit card information right after install, without first trying the app is a huge turn off especially when it's not being paid through Google play. Cancellation would have been difficult and I don't want to risk getting charged. Uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very inspirational!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just the perfect partner I have been looking for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This can really change your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is beutiful. Inspiring even. I just wish I could afford it but even the trial will do. It has helped me in ways I couldn't help myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you fabulous team membersü§û. good guidence. Improve in my habbits‚úîÔ∏è.keep it up ü§ù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far,this app has got me hooked!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm skeptical about these sorts of things but I believe it's a great tool to help you do what you need."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Customer service. I initially signed up for a 30 day trial and then was upgraded to a 90 day trial. Unfortunately i was still having difficulties trying to work my way through the different aspects of the app itself and the groups. Since i was struggling to use it the way i wanted to use it, i canceled around day 40. Then i noticed that fabulous had billed me the $40 dollars and not extended the trial to 3 months. Customer service finally got back to me and no refund. BS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Looking forward to my daily interaction with the app. Its quite trye to its name... fabulous!! The only down side is it requires some time to understand the app well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its very very educational, motivational and inspirational! I already created a simple habit by waking up in the morning, drinking water thats beside my bed, washing and moisturising my face and brushing my teeth. I also learned a lot from the self respect podcasts. Keep it up, Fabulous Team!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in the first week and am so far really appreciating this app. It drew me in and has inspired me to try building healthy habits, which is more than I can say for any other app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A day at a time, step by step. Funny how reminders help me be kind to myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A little too much for me but I always come back and give this app another go. I would love if Fabulous were an app I could return to for quality and productivity, as opposed to desperation. I'm sure the Devs would prefer that as well. However, I know this app helps hundreds of people in the way which they may yearn for, so I am only sharing one experience here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Early days, but even reminding you to drink more water has changed my mindset. Looking forward to explororing all the features and resources. If it helps your wellbeing, then it's worth the amount of a cup of coffee a month!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Decided to try this app out as a reminder to take time to do the more basic and important things in life. Got the premium trial to see if it might be worth it. Found it wasn't for me so I uninstalled the app and THOUGHT I cancelled the membership. Turns out there's five different screens between the initial cancel screen and the actual cancellation. So I've just thrown $40 in the trash. Just be aware if you try this. I'm pretty used to companies doing this sort of thing but fabulous is the worst"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me immensely in 6 days. I struggle with productivity, routine, and sticking to habits even though I know it benefits me. As someone who's mentally ill, the fact that this app only adds one thing a day is great for me, and the action feature has helped me to actually want to do the things Fabulous is suggesting, because there's no immediate pressure, and the things are so small. I highly recommend this app to anyone who struggles with routine, or their mental health. 5/5."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I wish you are able to skip habits you already mastered and move on the the next ones, like drink water, that is one I already mastered before installing the all and I want to see what else I should add to my routine. Other than that it's good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app! I just wish it had a calendar incorporated so I can plan everything in one app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried to charge me 36 pounds without asking. It has a creative ui but you have to wade through so much unnecessary things that it makes planning your daily routine quite arduous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Motivational and inspiring, almost magical concept."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"That's very nice... It helps me a lot to improving myself..... I just like it..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"loving it till now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: still no refund and also all my emails are being ignored and not responded to. BETTER TO USE A DIFFERENT APP ALL TOGETHER. Subscribe for the free period a year ago and forgot to cancel before the payment came out, accepted the loss of money, but this year even after cancelling my subscription a year again they have taken funds out my account again and refuse to refund due to having no subscription. Do not join this app if you do not intend to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a really helpful app. I lvt"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Warning! Do not download! I made the mistake of downloading and wanting to check out the app because it said there is a 7 day free trial. Well, they charged my card immediately and now I am having a heck of time trying to get my money back. The customer support on the app is a joke. I asked for a refund within minutes of my card being charged (basically as soon as I downloaded the app). The app itself is awful and poorly designed and not user friendly. Downloader beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried to take money off me without when fully signing up. 39.00"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Iam still trying to grab my new habits and get rid of old ones. Hope it goes well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Toooo compicated for me (I'm 39, I can write in language C, speak 4 languages, and being around with computers since I'm 12) Here some sound there some sound.. and when I think I'm still setting up my ""journey"" somehow Im in a screen as if I'm already doing the routins.. congratulations üôà Just.. too much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The ""contract"" is so eerie, like some kind of sect. Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app, it helps me to have good routines and see others who are like me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very Bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used the app a few days then all of a suddend got charged for premium without even being asked. Watch your bank accts close."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really motivating so far. Very interactive and engaging. The goals seem attainable and small enough to make realistic change that is sustainable. Here's hoping this works! üôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's truly really good, we all have excuses for doing stuff or not doing stuff, and while fabulous has you keep those mentally, you slowly start to let go of them and make your dreams come true"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Perfect But can make it free...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app to motivate you to achieve you'r goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great comprehensive lifestyle app, if you can follow. Highly recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only using the free portion available to see if I would like it, so far its absolutely amazing. üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ ÿ¨ÿØÿß ÿ¨ÿØÿß ÿ¨ÿØÿß"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the best app for building new habits, locking up the previous ( bad) habits, and changing for the great or good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bestest app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app cause of helping me to set daily habits and changing my life to the good side. ""Fabulous"" thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"To be honest, I am really feeling great and I am consistent with my life. All thanks to Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Must give it a try ..I not only found a helpful community but also the in built features of this app is tremendously calming inspiring and wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's amazing and relaxing üíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"See this paid promoted on IG a lot, will try.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wondrous ezperience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the animations and the storytelling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good, helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It should be free at least for one day to check its results"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just paid my subscription to be told I'd disconnected from Fabulous? Why can't you keep track of your accounts? Can't access my account because it doesn't recognize the email I'm signed in with. Less self-actualization, more proper database management?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't get trapped by the quickly expiring trial, you get auto enrolled into a year for $50+. They will ding your card faster than a porn site."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't cancel in app. You MUST go through their poorly designed website to do so. STAY AWAY. Apps that hide their membership cancellation are definitely banking on you giving up and letting the charge go through. This app isn't a ""routine planner"" you have to spend three days drinking water to unlock any other routines. They hide the cancellation on their website. They also force you into some broke version of twitter. Who hides a cancel option?? Scammers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice even if a bit invasive at some times"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üßòüèªüíßü•áüì¶üçΩÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice I enjoy working with Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app uses behavioral science to help you build better habits that will last you a life time and also can provide you with a different perspective on approaching problems in general. If you're not into hippy/happy stuff it might not be for you, but if you can look past it, it might become the app that helps you change your life for the better. The entire app works well, doesn't lag or crash or anything like that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app really helped me organize my life, build healthy habits through small actions. I really enjoy the stories that I hear from the app after reaching my objective. The script is well written, it fells like poetry."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just amazing really help me achieve my goals üòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The Check Button Not Working After We Read The Page."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used it for 3 days it is good to motivate me when I feel down also the water drinking habit is good every morning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just got charged $62 for a purchase that I never ordered. I installed and looked at the app last week thinking I could re do the free trial, realised I couldn't so I uninstalled the app. I definitely didn't re sign up for the subscription of my knowledge anyway and would like to know who I could talk too so then I can get a refund. Especially as when I logged back onto my account before, it says I still have to pay to be able to use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seriously so nice app I ever use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice interface! Great for beginners."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well it's very good to maintain your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"First week using the app and it's just pushy enough, lol. Gentle reminders are great. It's very encouraging so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like having your personal emotional caregiver. Breaks down the tiny building blocks to build up your energy both physically and emotionally. Gentle reminders. Helps to not overwhelm yourself and to see self discipline as a good thing. Thank you very much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"nothing more annoying than cloying hyper-optimism and terrible terrible poetry. this app was designed by 12 year old girls who watched way too many Disney movies. what's the science on that?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pretty rubbish and will charge you even if you cancel your account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far is a wonderful instrument for regaining the ability to human"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like having a kind and gentle friend who helps you stay motivated - except this one is in your pocket! Lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivates you to live your best life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app started out rocky by being very difficult to navigate. I pushed through and for 13 days was loving the app, it really worked. On the 14th day something went wrong in the app, which reset my streak from 13 days to 0. Tracking these journey's are a major part of habit building and seeing my streak reset, even though I kept it up, was a real hit. I've kept doing my routine but haven't really used the app. Add the ability to fix drop offs in the streak and this app will be truly amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"These People Are Theives. I cancelled my subscription but they continue to take money monthly. It's an outrage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled the free trial before it expired. They attempted to charge my account twice, and I sent emails asking them to not charge again because I had canceled. I sent screenshots. They charged my credit card 40 anyway, despite my correspondence with evidence. Now it's been since Oct 4-today 13-and I have to dispute the case with my credit account because I still haven't heard from the app. It's horseshit. Makes me skeptical of free trials on other apps. DO NOT USE THIS APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is Change your life ü•∞‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app the exrrcise is so wellll i love it omg"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not for me. The app is overly complicated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancel your trial IMMEDIATELY. Customer service non existent. -- I decided to try this app and I think the IDEA of it is neat.i think it's execution is lacking and more importantly the fact that hoops have to be jumped through to cancel is weird and annoying. I CHECKED where they said to cancel, it showed and STILL SHOWS I have no subscription but I was charged forty dollars. I do not understand. I will force cancel with my bank if necessary."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't like this app and it's quality.."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its an interactive experience that I'm enjoying. Easy to follow and the reminders help as well"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this App. It's helped Inspire me to keep moving forward to through my Journey. Thank you all for creating this App."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm so angry right now and will be filing a complaint.

Update- Customer service does not exist please buyer beware stay away from this app its a scam* reported to b.b working with my bank to rectify*"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutly Fabulous, Thank you for sharing this, I use to have Fabulous before but I don't know why I stopped, I think perhaps I started to feel Fabulous and I was able to be my best self but I guess as i started to feel Fabulous I stopped doing my daily routine or maybe I just got board, I can't remember which but I'm on this new journey now, so if at first you don't succeed, pick yourself up, dust yourself off & Try again so Here I am & Thank God & The Fabulous Premium update üòä üåªüíöüôèüòò‚ößÔ∏èüíñüòá"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Most value I've had from any app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Of course its a trial Edit: Still 1 star I just downloaded it againüíÄI hate that it writes a message ""from your future self"" to convince you to buy premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for you mental health you won't regret it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"No options for people who have to get in before 7 am or have changing schedules. Wayyyyy to many silly and time-wasting animations."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was buggy and frustrating. Prompt wasn't consistent in popping up, and when it did it was obnoxious and would make other apps crash."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly best thing I've done for myself in a long time. It's nothing huge but has help my ADHD and allowed me to follow a clear routine that I set and made for myself. I would highly recommend for someone who feels like they want to start a routine but doesn't know how too or where to start, this is the perfect start. Best self help app I have come across."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I do feel like this app helps me create habits, also I like that I can splash on certain screens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ü§ó ‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I do love this app. But don't fully understand it yet. I also have issues with the alarms"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I had it before, couldn't afford it, went through a bit of life and now I'm back to use Fabulous again because it really is a sincere and affirming accountability partner with a lovely community. With they scale they've achieved its also become a bit more affordable but the cost we count as users are the changes in our own lives, from health, to mind-sets to productivity. A highly recommended app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really an amazing app i ever use I'm really happy with this app i recommend it to others to download it and use It's really good app to add a good habit in your daily routine and make your life more productive and organized üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am not satisfied with the app and requested refund, but nobody even respond to your emails, so be carful guys. I lost one annual membership money. I have written to the support team one week ago but no reply yet which shows lack of support. I also read that I can contact their social media acounts to get response, did that but still retuned nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is soooooooo......cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love how it makes me feel special aboit going through this journey of love and hate coming together into making me,me. I thank this app for helping me disconnect and unwind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very useful but Its a bit overwhelming to get set up but once i got hang of it and tailored everything to my execise, food, art, rest, reading, studying, cooking, meditating and other needs its all in there and it all is easy to keep up with ESPECIALLY my various health drinks i have throughout day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Oh my gosh. I'm the kind of person who jumps in with both feet and tries to do everything all at once. With this app it makes me want to slow down and not move faster than what they ask you to. If you're the type of person who is an All or Nothing type of person then this app is great. It allows you to go as hard or as soft as you want. It feels like a video game. Thank you Fabulous. To everyone who helped make it happen. I Love you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not download this app or give them any access to any of your bank cards. I tried this app in 2021, and it wasn't what I was looking for so I canceled my subscription. It's even listed in the Google play store as canceled. However, today I was charged $40 for a subscription I canceled last year. They also charged it independently, not through Google which means they saved my card info, which they arent supposed to do. I have filed complaints. Beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not that anyone can't do it on their own but the guided routines make it easier to hold yourself accountable and remind you to stay on course."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I been using the app for 2 weeks and its amazing how it has truly helped trigger my brain to do certain things. I also love the inspirational messagew"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another one of those scammy apps that collects all your personal details and information before then telling you it will cost you money. Be honest and tell people upfront otherwise it's just dishonest and morally reprehensible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For the most part amazing. I wish you could view future challenges. Not start them but have an overview, maybe see the length and steps that go with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good ... I would like if there are more discount in it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great at turning small healthy habits into big life changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I will give this app 5 stars because it is motivator,helpful and productive app. It really helps me to make good habits and stay fit and healthy. Thanks FABULOUS!üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Due to my sleep times, I find it very difficult to use apps that use daily tracking, where we can't set our own time for the day rollover."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Several mostly blank white screens with answers but no questions (a sleep survey i think?) Followed by 2 minutes of a black screen. What a worthless app. Don't waste your time here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"They make big promises then they say buy this subscription to access your life and build a better you. 95% stuff are behind a paywall. If you can invest in your well-being I think it's a good app for you. I wish they introduced like first 1 month is free without you have to add any payment details. If you are looking for a free app to go over your hardships and monitor yourself, install the app called being, it has subscription system but you can get it for free by saying why you can't buy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far gr8"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stay away. They take money off your card even after cancellation and without any alert. Customer service is non existant, they completely ghosted me. Thankfully I was able to dispute the charge through my bank and got the money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is extremely helpful and very doable. It takes a bit of time to navigate through the app with ease, but once you got it, it is soooo worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great enough!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Definitely a slower, more measured pace. UI could stand a little improvement and a little more customization but all in all pretty good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When I first started using this app I felt productivity every section of my stuffs and I highly recommend this app to all people. Just feel peace and productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This isn't your ordinary app! Once you've setup your profile, the app is able to tell whether or not you're following your plan. It actually checks in with you to see if your stuck and offers solutions to get you back on track! I'm really impressed with how intuitive it is!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to get a refund but Google says to contact the developers, and all I can find is an AI with auto fill questions and answers! This app is not what I thought it was, and I don't find it useful right now. I am not satisfied with customer service and I don't think the product was worth the price."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Comes really handy It's really user friendly and the challenges are easy to folow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you actually have the ability to stick with the habits and different exercises the apps offer you can definitely improve your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"6 days into the free trial and I am loving it so far! I'm amazed at how the simple prompts make it feel easy to create healthy habits that I've put off for so long. The quiz told me that I need more ""focus"", which feels accurate, and then it created a ""journey"" for me with baby steps each day. The journey has kind of a fantasy/ adventure theme, so it feels fun, and every time you complete a step it rewards you by telling you the next part of your story. I plan to invest in the paid version!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app, really inspiring and aesthetic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried it few years ago and wanted to give it another shot. Horrible. Audio only for most stuff. And when you want to cancel premium you have to go on their website and then click through many, many ""dark patterns"" before you can actually manage to unsubscribe. They ask you why you are unsubscribing, but they don't even give you an option to fill out your own answer, just a bunch of their useless ones ü§£ The audacity to even ask if you are not really willing to learn and get better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good App so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was apprehensive to try anything like this. I usually spend my time on my phone mindlessly scrolling or watching the next recommended video. This has helped me tremendously to reclaim my life, I've lost 25 kgs in 3 months, my relationships with family, friends and work colleagues has improved drastically. I now hold my head high in confidence as I complete my daily tasks, starting with drinking water every morning, and progressing from there to exercise and so on. Thanks Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's going great for me (week 1 ended), the habit starts are easy and the small readings are really fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the app very much helps me too achieve me task"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me to be a better person it helps me to stuff i want to do but never do them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The best app for personal Development and Productivity üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app it feels like this app was my guru"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't unsubscribe in the app. It says to unsubscribe on a browser. Fair enough, but whether I try to login on browser by email or Google, it tells me to use the other one. So I can't login, and can't unsubscribe. I have to ask support to get back to me and then wait up to 10 days for a response from them. Any app that makes it this hard to unsubscribe feels like it more wants to steal from me than it wants to help me. So then I put in a ticket for help and it never is responded to..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After years of struggling with executive dysfunction and brain fog making it hard to stick to routines and relax, this app has given me a glimpse of hope I never thought I'd see without expensive and extensive professional help! 10/10 recommend to everyone who needs a little extra help getting yourself back on track or into a routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It reminds me of what I want to do, what I have to do to get there, all with encouragement &, above all, without being annoying. TY!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good one, if it gets boring, I'll reduce the starts ( to future me)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Im the type of person that craves boundaries because I lack self discipline. This app in a few days has already put me on track for my personal goals. The big one being accountability, the desire to show up for myself. This app helps do that in a nonintrusive or not annoying manner. Can only recommend this app if you truly seek change in your life and yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps to hold me accountable and feel motivated. Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is such a well thought out and gorgeous app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changes my whole life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've been charged again this year. I do not have a subscription! This is getting infuriating!! One star for repeated billing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far and seeing small improvements after just over a week.. only thing is would be nice to be able to see when the free trails have finished and make it easier to control your subscription as I've somehow paid two small payments when according to a email I could have got 30 more days free. Another not as important but it would also make it easier if you could search for what you're looking for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pointless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good I'm enjoying the Guidance,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app changing lives"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst thing ever not worth the money and a pain to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This fabulous app is just ""fabulous"" in developing a person's character nd attitude towards something nd help in bringing a good change if followed honestly nd wisely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been using it for the past week and enjoy it, but I have issues with it being a little pushy with the journey thing. I just wanted to stick to the routine I usually have. Getting me to wake up and walk or exercise when I have limitations making me unable to do either is odd. Just let me relax and stick with the water every morning, breathing in, etc. That I need. I don't need much else. Great app, just fairly pushy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A nice motivating app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Super sketch!! You have to ""sign"" a contract with your fingerprint before you start!! I'm surprised I don't see more people concerned about this detail..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Helpful friendly reminders. I love how it takes baby steps and while it encourages to keep going and take another step forward, if your not ready you don't have to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Updated: I'm surprised. They actually refunded me after a few weeks. I really thought I'd just never hear from them. I did like this app, but they should just be more direct and clear about what their ""free gifts"" in their emails actually are. It would save everyone some trouble."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Engaging and fun. Artwork is beautiful and enticing. Audible cues are pleasant and uplifting. Music helps flow. The storylines, coaching, and inspirational stories and letters are meaningful, psychologically significant, and behaviorally transformative. I decided to hit a reset button for health and well-being in my life, something potentially overwhelming if done without mindfulness and small steps. Fabulous came along at the right time to support my new habits and mental focus. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm fairly new to this app. So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app to be more diciplin"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's so motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it really helps to keep track of your routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is a very good app just need those premium things make stuff difficult ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would really appreciate a refund. My free trial was wonderful, but I cannot afford that much extra a month..I do want to add; Google Play did not notify me, nor did it show up under my subscriptions. That's not cool - all of my free trials, Always come up under subscription on Google Play. I can email a sceenshot. But I thought this app was wonderful it's worth it if you can afford it. I will certainly be adding this app to my favorites and wishlist. ‚ù§üçØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's soothing and pleasant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good :) only on day 3.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a 1 week free trial and cancelled on the same day but was charged a yearly subscription anyway. I have emailed about a refund because the app made it impossible to get a refund. If I do not hear back soon I will definitely file a complaint. This is not okay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a very very useful app thank you I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app crying in my bed at 6:30am on a Monday morning dreading my day at work... dreading my destined mental state I would end the day in. It's been 2 weeks maybe an yes I've already stopped using it as I always do with habits but then ..... I came back.....which never happens I never resume my progress!! This is amazing truly an amazing app! P.s. I suffer from E.D.'s, Anxiety, and Depression. ü§ó for any one wondering if it will work for them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fabulous is a decent app but it is also very needy by constantly wanting me to review how great it is even after I paid for the premium version and even then it isnt satisfied with my yearly subscription and wants me to commit for life kinda like being married to it. Lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app but I only get notifications when I open it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day 6, and it has already changed me for the better. I almost threw up drinking water as soon as I wake up at first. Now it's easy and reenergizing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is worth the hype! I just started using this app. It's been a week, and I absolutely love it. I'm starting to see changes within my habits. This app helps me stay productive and on tasks. I encourage people out there to give this app a chance. What I also love is that I get to choose what tasks I want to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ir is really fabulous to start new good habits. Keep the tiny changes up, I believe in you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's it's okay, good, or great. You have to understand you get what you put into it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to purchase subscription. There's no ""in app purchases"" 7 day trial isn't enough to see if the app will work for me. Honesty about being a paid app would be a good start for a ""well being"" app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so much helpful i really appreciate it .. it is also motivational bcz there are some other people who are in the sale condition like you and you can listen them n also can Share ur things .."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As soon as it started talking about what Michelle Obama (Michael) does in the morning I uninstalled it. No thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Too many of the apps functions are paid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good and it's also work like alarm We are able to use its well for our changes and in many other ways to improve our self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"App itself seems good but it's harassing me all the time to subscribe to paid membership, so overall I am Not happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice. I give it a 4 star just cause I'm starting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I was loving the app and think it is definitely worth $3/ month. However, I was billed 39.99. Which doesn't make sense. I immediately deleted the app and canceled. Do not recommend giving them any payment info."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really like the layout and presentation. I feel like it's working even though it's small. The tones and the music are very attention grabbing.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The only problem that I have is that I work shift work so some mornings I am up at 4:30am and sometimes I don't get off work until 11:30pm which makes routines a little difficult"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm trying anything to make me hate myself less. This has worked longer than most"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I used this app for years. I recently got a new phone and updated Android OS and the app is now unusable. The overlay causes the phone to lock up. I did not receive a response from customer service. I restored my machine and did not reinstall the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this, I have trouble keeping schedule and taking care of myself and this app is genuinely helping me."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A lot of bugs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Help? I no longer subscribe and have not for over a year but was just charged for another year. I have confirmed this app is no longer in my subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how easy and organized this app is, I feel that it really helped me achieve better habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not my cup of tea since you could only have one thing active at a time but the support team was very helpful when I had issues with the subscription. I would definitely recommend the app to anyone looking for bettering their life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is just what it is.... All in one word. Keeps me focused. I love the new updated as well, keeps you eager to open up something new."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think fabulous is such a great app!, I'm actually new to the app and I just started. But my bad habits started to change into new good habits, I have more motivation to do stuff, I sleep better etc. I love this app so much and I definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to delete my account and deleting it is literal pain without the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helps motivate me to do my best. I used to always do whatever, but the app made it easier to plan my days and help me feel better. I honestly don't like routines and schedules, but this app really does help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous go for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Getting back to center. Since I took I'll I have forgotten how to get back to me. This was a great thump to the head, I'm glad to have stumbled upon this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I tried it because of the ad on Instagram with the Meyers-Briggs personalities in it, but the app doesn't test you on that. Doing the first week of the first journey is going to be tedious since I already drink water, eat good breakfasts and dance every day. This app could have potential but it's just not worth the effort."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not even giving me notification at all no more to say and I know ( it's not in battery opti or anything like that)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only had the app for a few days, but so far, I've been able to set and keep my goals and it's been a WHILE since I've been able to do that. I love the variety of goals you can set, I only wish I could create goals that are specific to me and I couldn't really find on the list. Also wish I could have more than three routines, but I can customize the name of the routines, so that helps! Overall very pleased and I look forward to using it more going forward."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have really enjoyed this App. It helps me to keep on track and look after myself well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life for the best. I've got every-day goals which helps me spend my time more wisely and lose weight"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"(premium) hasta el momento todo genial, una chimba ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üí™üèº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app and I only just got it a few weeks ago. I love it. The cute little sounds it makes when your done with that habit makes me want to do more. I'm that person that can only do one task until its done, then can I go on to the other; so this is a great application for me. Thank you Fabulous for this amazing app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helped me kick start a healthy lifestyle a little bit at a time. After a while it felt strange to not exercise every day. It's definitely worth it for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really a great app, it deserves it's high rating. The people and the community are so kind and positive. Am sure you won't regret installing. But I guess some more sessions and challenges should be free. And there should be an option for creating your own challenges. Anyways love this appü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I keep coming back to Fabulous to put me on the right path. This app is well-built and I enjoy how much it helps me daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pretty bad The app itself seems ok but it's designed to help with calm but keeps hassling me constantly to upgrade to premium or buy another on if their products. I would actually pay for premium but they only allow lump sum payments and there's a cost of living crisis on. So you can't do much without paying and you can't pay in ways you can currently afford... Amazing they have such little self awareness, ironic really..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update Oct 2022: Draw over apps feature affects my touch screen capabilites when the draw over other apps feature is activated. Turning this setting off is a simple solution BUT The full screen feature other notification styles are too easy to dismiss/delay rendering the app ineffective for me. Any recommendations?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its a very good app its just the in-app purchases"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app, deleted it a while ago and now that I want to get back on track I'm back with Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Perfect!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So you gotta pay for this üí©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good so far, I'm enjoying it, it seems a bit pricey tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Habits form success whatever we put our minds to. The reminders are very welcome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app never once reminded me to drink water, meditate, or make my bed... It's advertised to help build habits (for a fee) and it simply didn't. I am not satisfied with my trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have started it using and waiting for some changes in my self üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you develop great healthy habits"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly have never followed any routine or journal apps for longer than 3 days and I'm beyond amazed that Fabulous has kept me engaged and productive for an unbroken streak of 15 days already. I'm so glad and happy that I found Fabulous, it has helped me so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good luck on figuring out how to unsubscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lifestyle changing. Very epic. Would recommend. 11/10."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I loved the app at the beginning and paid for a whole year. However, I stopped using it after some months because the UX feels overly complicated and crammed with too many things. I think that when I'm looking to improve my mental health, having so many options and challenges and simply so much content is counterproductive. The one simple little thing that I want from this app is a widget for my routines and habits and they don't even have that. It would make it so much easier to use it daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just fantastic for people who focus on self improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I am bad at starting habits and keeping up with them and this app is really helping me through it daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only had for a few days, but I like the little nudges to get moving towards goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App For Staying Focus On Your Short Term(Daily) and Long Term Goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I normally don't do these kind of self-help apps, but i figured I could try this one out. You do a test, watch a video set a goal to drink water every morning and then the app asks you to input your creditcard for a monthly subscription. Sorry, but if you don't prove your app useful before asking for money, it's a big no from me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"At first I thought this was free. And that these people actually wanted to help people change for the better. It's really just a scam to get money of people wanting to improve themselves. Try notion instead. Quite disappointed I thought this would be a good idea."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It has a subscription cost."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing apps, loving since 6years üòòüòò"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Two stars only because it sounds good but I need to input credit card info in order to view a generalized plan. I'm not proving cc info, so I have no idea how good, or bad, it really is. If I had the chance to at least get a glimpse of what the app plans for me, I might consider the payment info for the free trial period."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great two days of pure motivation!!! I needed this!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forced pay in app, that is not in app purchases."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is a great application for me and it can sometime be annoying for someone who lazy like me but overrall it helps me build a new good habit and thanks to it my unhealthy lifestyle has changed. Really really help me eventhough I'm a beginner.‚úåüòä‚úå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"To change my life it cost money"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the graphic, love the voice used, everything is awesome so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app i mean very good for setting you daily routine and achieving your goals"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Young person I am not a young person and I have struggled my whole life and I started using this app and I'm actually making changes I'm almost 70 but it's never too late! I love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disappointed that it requires your fingerprint to access the app; not so sly way to steal biometrics. App deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having only used this app a few days I can already feel the amazing impact this app is having on my mental health. I feel so much more happier, I 100% advice for you to download and give this app a try.. you will not regret you did."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why am I being charged for another premium membership? No one will respond to my emails. Very frustrating."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Es de las mejores aplicaciones que hay, tanto su versi√≥n gratuita como la paga, recomendad√≠sima"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its a good....but Some feature is in paid....so that i am upset...because i am still a student and Don't have much money to pay or purchase a premium version.. üòê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been such a great app. I like how visually appealing it is and it makes meeting my goals easier."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just want to say Fabulous Daily Routine is the best decipline app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating and inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No notifications, limited flexibility"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wow what an amazing app. Its been 2 weeks since using this app. Its so nice and motivates us. But... Why should we attend only 1 challenge at a time. Why cant we do many challenges. You should also keep a timer in each challenge such as in productivity. So I request you to add a feature to do many challenges at a time. Thank you. But a high recommendation app it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing will update soon after a month"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The login through google is not working for me. Edit 1/10/22: I did that when I left the review. No one has contacted me back yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far feeling good and fulfilling my purpose"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just joined a two days ago. So far I'm loving what I see."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this app for 3 days but so far I love everything about it! You can pick from different goals you want to pursue based on what you want to fix in your life RN. And build your own habits list for each daily routine, & if you pick too many too soon it warns you so you don't overwhelm yourself and get deterred too quickly. If you're looking for a way to change the slump you're in or just work on healthier lifestyle habits I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FABULOUS! It does not disappoint!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive and motivating guide that helps me celebrate the seemingly little goals like drinking a glass of water in the morning, to the larger goals such as regular exercise, and more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Awful customer service. I was charged 3 times for one yearly subscription, so I submitted a ticket where I was told it would be reviewed and I would be contacted within 10 business days. It's been 14 business days and I haven't heard anything back. Don't give them any money. Edit: 21 days minus some weekends and attempted communication over multiple platforms. Added a star because they finally issued me refunds. Still, totally unacceptable customer support for a paid service. Don't recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I liked the UI very much.So far good to stay on track of habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im loving this app so far! Its making me get into routines and helping me out with my time management issues so this is helping me out a lot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had this app installed and canceled before the free trial was up. Two months lafter the subscription had expired, we received two $40 charges in the same month! Customer service was impossible to reach, so I reported the charges as fraudulent. Beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just do it. Breath. And do it. Then relax. Then do it again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's really bright and it really motivates you. Also it helps you become a healthier person! I'm just a kid, but, yeah! I love it so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I loved this app and even subscribed however my phone had broke so downloaded the app again on my new one a week later and all of a sudden I've been unable to access my old profile even though I signed up through my Google account. Now, when I tried to access an old link from an email I received when I first subscribed, it took me to a website to sign in; signed in then google play sent a warning notification stating that this app does not comply with secure browser policy? I'm so confused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful in changing your mind set"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is pretty good it is helping me quite a bit"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"EASY to follow, BEAUTIFUL layout, CALMING voice, & ENCOURAGING .Absolutely LOVE this app. !!! EVERYONE SHOULD INCLUDE THIS IN THEIR DAILY LIFE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought the app was going to be great and it was at first, but as you keep going on you have to have premium to do so many features. The main ones that bothered me is you have ti have it for the morning routines based on your personality and to make more than 4 tasks on a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It was bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excelente app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is more than the typical sterile checkbox you get from keeping a planner or checklist. The daily coaching and added insights and programs help me understand how to change and how to have a routine that adds value to my life. You ease into every new habit so it's seemlessly integrated into your life. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it! Barley any ads,already improving and i only got it tpday,definitely recommend!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a fantastic app. I have been doing daily tasks for a while and read Atomic Habits by James Clear. I am just so happy that there is an app that puts everything in a very welcoming form to build and maintain habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great for holding myself accountable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"While the App itself is actually Fabulous -I haven't received any response from your team. I paid for the premium membership and I'm not able to access/log in to my account. While I understand that my original  data may be lost,  I would still appreciate being able to use the app  since I paid for the program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After putting Gmail continue option not working ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helps get your life together and gives you so many options to choose from for how you want to live your life witch is great because it guide's you but at the same time gives you the freedom to choose for yourself what you want. Excellent job!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I personally like this app, the name speaks for itself its fabulous! I love this app it really helps out people of all ages. Anybody with bad habits they will fade it away its that good, the animations are way too good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is just like it's name.. Fabulous... Actually found something which is selflessly helping out people practically... Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice even without premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My opinion has not changed: DO NOT even CLICK on links promoted by Youtubers. THEY TOOK MY PAYMENT INFORMATION BUT DID NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THEY WILL CHARGE ME $50 on top of the $1 stated originally. EVEN IF I DID NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP. THEY REFUSE TO IMPROVE THEIR APP TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM. AVOID. You can see other reviews showcasing this issue and they said they are working on improving BUT TAKING YOUR MONEY IS STILL THEIR PRIORITY. AGAIN. AVOID."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous gives me someone to connect with since I live alone and I find the voice soothing & encouraging. I look forward to hearing more & guiding me onward."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I needed help staying on track, this has really helped me. Thank you so much! üçÇüåæüçÅ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bummer. Asking for CC info. You going to give me a free 7 days then do it and if I like it ill sign up. Didn't try it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far. I loved the journaling prompts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Inflexible, definitely not what I was looking for. Plus, will charge you immediately (not after the 7 day trial as any other app would). I've filed for a refund but am willing to bet that I won't see a penny back. It's also sketchy that it charged $1 twice before charging $49.99."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is ADHD friendly has been helping a lot already and I can't wait to see how I'm doing after my first month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self-motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I love how organized the app is. How personable every letter is. I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just starting but it really helps make it easy and attainable to form new Good Habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the gratitude 7days routines, unexpectedly was nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is no free version. They are offering one week free and then you have to subscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Be VERY CAREFUL to cancel any subscriptions they talk about or you will end up with a 40‚Ç¨ bill without notice for the annual subscription. I did get a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app to gradually built good habits !! It also helps in changing your life style into a better healthier one . I use the free version and it's great!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps alot tbh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"just sooo gooood"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"If all you want is a reminder to drink water, exercise or meditate, this app can do that BUT just that. I tried several coaching programs in the app &the best I got was 4 days of actual taskst on a 15 days programs. The customer service is practically inexistant as it just doesn't get back to you. Basically this is a fancy alarm clock system. That is all it is. It talks a very big game and delivers no more than a habit reminder system . Not worth the money or the hype. I feel I got scammed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please be careful with any promotions you receive with this app. The app charged me three different times once the promotion was over. I ended up well over $130 for $40 app (it charged me two additional $16 fees). I kept receiving messages from the app to sign up after I already had. I signed up with the same login three separate times on the same day thinking the payment got stuck and not once did the app stop me stating this email was already activated. This scams it's costumers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely app, gentle progress to help form new and positive habits. Well done üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No reminders, no notifications, I woke up one day to see that money were taken from my account for the premium subscription. I had the premium trial enabled, haven't been using the app but still they took my money. Not nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app slowly transforms my life, I am not there yet but growing every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Seems excellent, so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app definitely unlocks the better me, even without using it, I can start sticking to a schedule that works for my school and free time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's help me to much to get started"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got charged a billions time and all I ask for was a free trial. I'm trying to contact the app, on the website or the app, you can't find a way to talk to anybody, they always refer you to another link or page or section. I need a lot of refund for you guys! Tell me how to contact you ASAP. Thank you! UPDATE: I got a refund last year and they ""canceled"" my subscription, however, somehiw, imnstill getting charge AGAIN this year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really helped me develop a solid routine. i recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Deixou de ser uma ferramenta confi√°vel. Sou usu√°ria desde 2018. Ele era maravilhoso. Mas, recentemente, ficou muito cheio de informa√ß√£o e quando a gente abre em vez de a gente focar em cumprir as rotinas, somos assaltados por ""quer fazer um desafio?"", ""entre no grupo"" ou ""analise sua semana"". Agora passaram a tirar recursos silenciosamente. √â como se eu tivesse comprado uma caixa de ferramentas, e na hora da necessidade do martelo, descobrisse que a loja afanou o item enquanto eu dormia."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is fabulous. Such a unique and motivating app. I was surprised to see that it didn't have any pre-set habits relating to prayer or scripture study (many people want to include those in their daily routine), but I was able to manually add those."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Read the fine print! Not that it'll help you. I canceled this subscription after 15 days into a 30 day free trial and they charged me for an annual subscription anyway. When I tried to dispute it, they claimed I didn't cancel in time. That didn't stop them from canceling the subscription and keeping the money. The app itself is fine, but their ethics are horrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me tremendously on creating healthy habits. It slowly dips you in to a productive life so you actually succeed. It has surprised me how well it works. Usually when I try to improve myself I end up giving up pretty quickly but with this app I have continuously been improving a little everyday for 4 days so far. I know that seems little, but for someone who never made it to the second day this is a big thing, And I'm still going! Editing my streak :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I guess just be aware, I only had the app for 1 day, Decided it wasnt for me and Had canceled it but still got charged? i went to the actual sight to log on to see what happened and i was still subscribed? I canceled again, I tried to get a refund but apparently if you cancel through google play you dont get one, so now im out 40 bucks and that sucks. And for something i literally had for one day and never even used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÿ≠ŸÑŸà ÿ¨ÿØÿß"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"amazing mental health app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very friendly app. I like it very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For someone with ADHD that only had one good habbit - drinking water in the morning - i feel that the constant reminders almost made me stop doing that. Since my brain doesn't work with strict schedules, it felt like badgering most of the time. And since i couldn't do the 3 essentials every morning, to me it felt like i couldn't build any other habits that i was interested in without doing those 3. I felt that every day it just added more shame and self-criticism. Maybe it works for others"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is so amazing it helps you build new habits and helps you keep track of them ... I love this appü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me set things on the right direction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Behavioral research is built into every journey, challenge and practice session. Start building habits today"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm becoming fabulous me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Helpful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm not very good with it even after a long time. But I enjoy it more and more as I continue to interact with it. üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app kept making my phone freeze after everytime I used the app. For reference, my phone is a Samsung Galaxy A12, and this doesn't happen with my other apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really excellent app that strikes a balance between providing freedom and structure in your day to day routine. I appreciate how it gives you the basic routine, but then grants you freedom to add more things and edit your routine as you wish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, even the free version isn't bad. You do only get the basic sounds and are limited generally, but the cost of the plan isn't bad for what you are trying to do. Building habits isn't easy, and this helps you towards the right direction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I woyld try this app if it had a version that is really free and not just 7 days. Its pointless üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam and total invasion of every single bit of PERSONAL information, IP address via internet, your phone plan, banking information to suddenly charge you whatever whenever Update to reply: I didn't say anything about taking ones fingerprints?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One of the most toxic ""mental health"" apps there has to be. One of the exercises are where you have to envision your self dying. Yes I said that. If you have severe depression I would not suggest this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good... infact it can be use free for 7 day's..i am motivated first day with this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app in itself is fine, nothing special. A lot of the routines and plans are blocked unless you have premium, which is $40 a month. So I signed up for the trial, and it's impossible to cancel the subscription. You can't do it on the app itself, you have to go to the website to cancel, so I did that, and I was still getting charged. So I started a chat with support, and have reported the issue multiple times, yet my card is still getting charged. It's a scam to steal your money. Don't buy it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One Of The Best Apps i've never rated any apps before because i didn't feel like it deserved to be rated but THIS app, it's just so brilliant it'd be a crime not to rate this app 5 stars. it helped me a lot through my journey of life. thanks to this, now i have a very organized and planned life. the only thing is that i can't add more than 4 habits without subscription, so its kinda sad. still would recommend it to everyone! Love Love Love."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app but I don't like because if you don't have premium you can't do so many things (still a good appü§ç)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Free trial is a scam. I planned to use the free trial, but was charged for a year right away and no way to get a refund. ----- In response to the developer: I messaged the support team approximately 2 weeks ago and haven't gotten any response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I would have loved to use it. I liked the graphics, the quotes, the structure. But you have to pay to use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Used it was calming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app, really! I just dislike that I can't mark things on ""bedtime routine"" from the previous day. A lot of times I have done it but slept before I could mark it as done and then the chain is broken not because I didn't do it, but because I forgot to mark it. In resume, I'd like it to be possible to change things from previous days. Apart from that, the app is really really great! It has helped me a lot on new habits and I've been a lot more productive in the mornings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app I found rather distractive than useful in any ways. The worst thing is that they have charged my account when my free trial period started. I first reached out for help and received no answer for quite a while. Second time they wrote me back finally saying that according to their T&C's they can't refund me. They seem or pretend not to have functioning brain when I explain the situation that I should have not been charged just upon starting my free trial. * see cliche response...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION! I thought I had cancelled my subscription only to find out that they charged me anyway! They make it extremely difficult to cancel the subscription in your settings and you need to log into their website, because you can't cancel on your phone/app. I contacted customer service was told they would reply within 10 days. It has been 2 weeks and I am still waiting! I also tried reaching out on their social media. AVOID THIS APP!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a free 30 day trial and was charged after 7. I've contacted Fabulous 3 times without a response. I'd really appreciate a refund. Update: They've now charged me twice and still no response. Instead of me having to get in touch via your social media ""fabulous"" how about you respond to my messages and email. I have never had to write such a bad review."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app. Has helped me get organised and back to some form of normality at a very difficult time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app sells anxiety and provide solution for problems that don't exist while gathering all your personal data"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is a free 7-day trial but it hounds you for payment every time you click a box. I hated that it asked for a fingerprint to begin & found that it wasn't willing to work with my schedule. The most annoying instance was when it asked to remind me to leave water by my bed; a fine idea, except that its reminder 'ping to set up your water at 9pm.' can't be reset. Putting out water nearly 12 hours before my bedtime (I work nights) seems like overkill."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very detailed, cute and sensefull concept - just in my first days but enjoying a lot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it keep going"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good suggestion by app but can,t make me do it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible and I couldn't get a refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still on the first week using this app, but so far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up which was a bit of a messy process and then for some reason the subscription cancelled itself without my input."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled this app already but it still have automatic payment to me about HKD$309."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is saying it's gonna help people out but it's a moneygrab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's already helping to build better habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Recently started using the app and just saw a review saying the app forced you to pay- you don't have to pay. Just cross off the pop up and continue. It is just an ad for the premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm still on my first week of trying this app, and I'm hella impressed by how well designed and how helpful it is. I've been taking meditation and mindfulness classes for almost a year now, and this app is a really great complementary companion. Thank you team Fabulous for putting this out there. I appreciate you."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"sexy asf"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was a little dissapointed that moat of the features you have to pay for but even wirhout them I use this as a tracker. I love the stories it tells after completing a daily challenge and the arent very long and leave you wanting to complete your challenge the next day to see where the story goes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to start with healthy habits. Strongly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The idea is good but I turned off the sound. Visually very attractive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app for motivating change. Easy to use and lots of challenges to take part in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Did 30 day free trial and in the fine print I'd signed up for an upfront annual membership of $62.99AU."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I am grateful for Fabulous and look forward to delving deeper. It takes some getting used to the interface. But I dig it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is very hard to cancle it charged my $55 I delete it the app customer service is hard to come by I regret the free trial so much. Why did I put my information ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't tell you about the cost until you install and give your email and first name. Then you are hit up for the cost. Whether it's $40 or a hundred dollars, I'm so tired of these types of deceitful apps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really great. Helping me achieve my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I knew I shouldn't have asked for a free 7 day trial, but I tried it anyways. I tried to cancel the subscription before the week ended and thought I canceled. I was charged $40 anyways. I tried to refund the charge, but the refund policy refused to reimburse me. Others have had this exact same issue. I will continue to fight this charge. This app was meant to help anxiety, and now it's the cause of it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive, uplifting and motivating. Leading to positive life changes after a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is really helping me stay on track during the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still new to the app but it's simple & vibrant with a good variety of graphics. I love the idea of it helping you to create routines & just better yourself all around with some real basic steps, making it easily achievable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many notifications throughout the day. Don't like the habit tracker. Not very flexible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great idea for an app, but i get probably about 30 notifications daily. F that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only had the app installed for about a week, but so far it's fun & uplifting, as well as very well designed and user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have changed my mindset and my lifestyle with Fabulous and I am So much Happier. I can actually smell the roses and enjoy life each day. It makes me feel a sense of accomplishment everyday knowing I can put the use of this app to my daily life!!! Absolutely Love It!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me even though I canceled the free trial a week before it was over. And they haven't answered any emails. Need I say more?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pwoli sanam P"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Warm up exercise please add."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty nice, helps me do things in habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Me gusta como esta dise√±ada la app y es muy barata. Me Ayuda mucho a motivarme :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and calming. Full of amazing self care resources."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app to make a schedule for myself and work on having more regular routines. It asked me to select areas to work on and I didn't select anything regarding health or diet, yet the first activities it pulled up were about drinking more water and eating healthier. Others were about intermittent fasting and other dietary changes. As someone with a history of an eating disorder, I was very annoyed that a planner app wanted to get involved in my food habits without a skip option."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AWESOME‚ö°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying the app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally beneficial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription on September 5 but they are still trying to get money from my account. I sent them an email on September 6 but didn't answer me yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"doesn't let you unsubscribe via app (does let you subscribe via app), and does not give you a link to the page where you can unsubscribe. Once you find that page, it is still a pain to unsubscribe. This is not the way to keep customers. This is the way to frustrate your customers. I'm not going to comment on anything else the app does, this behaviour is unacceptable. edit: it doesn't even ask for feedback when you say you're not enjoying the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP! They took an unauthorised payment from me for a yearly subscription I cancelled after a trial over a year ago. Impossible to get in contact with them to get my money back without out reactivating my subscription!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has helped me in making healthy and positive small steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app, jist a but of a ui mess/streak animations take to long sometimes, but thise are just nitpick"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome. I really love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think this app is my new bff!üíùüíñüíì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It change my habit little by little and i feel energized with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is expensive, ugly and unintuitive. Definitely not recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to improve lifestyleüëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Long winded and linear with no customer service AVOID. APP DEVELOPER NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH - JUST MAKING PROFIT! Downloaded the app and it takes you down a fixed multiple question route for set up. You have to add your card details onto the app as not taken via play so if you do not like the app after the trial you have to log onto the website and find out how to cancel your card details as removing the app via play store does not work. Never respond to support emails. AVOID!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fun so far but difficult to work around shift work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you're not add your payment details, you can't use app. You can use it free for 7 days. That's all. After you add your payment method."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I changed my cell phone and I can't log into my profile, the app insists that I start from scratch again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Basicly a scam. So i paiyed after the trial week, bc i felt like the app helped me. But then they chareged me twice in the app and my complaint was just ignored. (We will get to you within 10 days... Its been a month since that.) So unless you want to spend 90‚Ç¨ on an app that you ignore after two weeks I do not recommend fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a little weird at first. Difficult for me to navigate the app. I like the one step at a time to change personal habits. Then creating new ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really loved this app. But I would love to use it when it is free. The team is doing great job, but it must should not have that large amount for premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another info harvester looking to cash in on your personal info."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a fan that if you mark it off later because you didn't get around to it earlier it says you didn't do it I'm not sure if the timing is based on gmt 0 or your local time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammed! Unhappy with the service. I tried to subscribe to their free monthly trial. It shown an error message so I tried three times and I emailed their support service. Guess what? I had three times 54.99$ out of my bank account so over 150$. I asked again to please refund and fix this. No answers. I have been ghosted! I NEVER wrote a bad review but after 3 emails sent this feels like a scam to me. Please fix this and refund me the 164.97$ CAD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"subscription is *not* through google play, but an in-app credit card or paypal... not even on option for google play. i'm not comfortable handing my cc/pp info over to a random app, especially when google play is right there. i might uninstall because without paid version, it's very limited, and i'm not interested in handling financial data and credentials directly to fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! As a person who struggles with self care this has changed that for me! I'm still in the starting stage of learning self care but this app has definitely helped me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really exactly what I need to get myself out of a rut. Practical tasks, easy goals, gentle reminders. Great stuff, this app is actually making me happier in life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been helpful for me so far! I'll probably check in when I've been using it longer, I'm still on week one, but I like it! There are stories that I think are kinda nice to see, and the goals build up in an acheiveable way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very nice app, it would remind ypu to drink water and many others i love it! There are so many features that are so cool!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Outstanding performance, this helps me to increase my abilities, and much more. Really thanks for making this type of app.üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy going goal setting and habit forming. I have been waiting a long time for this App!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great great great!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think it is great if you struggle with every day things. I did it for a while and I am just getting back into it. The app is a little bit all over the place and confusing however."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great app except if you do intermittent fasting this app can't accommodate it. You have to do the breakfast challenge or you cannot progress... Doesn't make sense at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very help full for people that have bad routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's different, uncomfortable from the familiar, but it's worth escaping the comfort zone to overcome and become someone new"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Patience is a virtue. I downloaded Fabulous many many times looking for a planner where I could cram everything I wanted to do at once, not understanding how the app really works. I finally gave it a chance and followed the program, and it made so much more sense. The gradual habit changin method is just perfect, you might not achieve as much as you'd like immediately but if you are persistent, changes will surely be long-term! Worth giving it a try, even the free version is a very good tool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seens to be 1 week free, but if you don't pay you can't try some features. Even if you don't subscribe, it'll start sending emails anyway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good step by step self improvement tool. I just wish I could give a free guest pass to myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'd recommend this app to every single person!!!ü§©üòç Love the idea...if I could, I would have downloaded this app in your devices 2.üòÉ looking forward for more applications like these..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Anything that says they'll give you a free trial, and then requests your credit card information is a turn off for me. If you do like to give people a chance to try it out for a week, do so, without them giving away valuable information. Let people decide if they want to continue and purchase after the trial or not. Usually they practice catching you with the ""free"" trial with the hopes that you'd forget to cancel it and they'll charge you anyway. Nah, ain't doing this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's definitely a good app to make u feel positive about yourself and motivates you to achieve your goals of the day . I like this app ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is such a great addition to my lifestyle changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved the app, the animation and features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy, simple and profound."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging and easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been really practical for now, though the free version has a limit to the amount of tasks you can have, which is annoying but its overall a good app to keep track of your basic tasks during your day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"J'ai install√© l'app il y a qlqs jours pour voir et au final je n'√©tais pas decid√©e √† m'y abonner. J'ai donc annul√© la version d'essai avant l'√©ch√©ance et surprise, on me facture quand m√™me et on me laisse sur la version gratuite. J'ai donc envoy√© des mails de reclam, 2 pour √™tre pr√©cise. J'ai regard√© un peu les avis n√©gatifs sur l'app et surprise encore, il y a bcp de gens qui sont dans le m√™me cas en ce moment. J'√©sp√®re qu'ils me rembourseront mais en attendant, je laisse qu'une √©toile"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I would have never expected such an app to actually help me face my heavy procrastination issues. It realized i'm a procrastinator and gently pushed me to face it. Perfectionism is not a virtue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Because of the app I developed a habit of drinking water after waking up by my bottle which I love! ( I think that's have being for like 5 year when I first time use it and haha times go away really fast!) Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app for better you... As long as you do the routine... It'll help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using the app for almost 2 weeks now, and so far I really like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worked great to help me get routines down and get to the place I wanted to be physically and mentally. Now, I'm fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My experience has been going great because of the breakfast routine i feel more energetic when learning and the wayer routine is also great for ur routine and if u complete it they will make u feel so good about urself but if u dont complete it they will Encourage you to do it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app does start out slow, but don't let that fool you!! As I've learned, it's tiny steps over time. This app has successfully gotten me through a major life change I wasn't sure I could make. Thanks to Fabulous, i got through the other end. For that alone, this app was worth every penny. Now, it's helping me form better habits. Thank you so much, Fabulous. Thank you, thank you! The only feedback i can give is there are too many notifications. I blocked app notifications on day 1."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Always encouraging. Small steps at a time. App is just what I needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started and I'm excited to change my lazy life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its a good app and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun app Easy to understand and do"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have use it for 3 days and I see the potential. I am unsure I am using it correctly as my routine changes depends on what's gonna be the day like and pre-plan is done on paper and pen. Also the challenges like drinking water is somethi g I already did and it is time consuming not being able to skip these or plan the days accordingly. But probably it is me not getting the hand of it yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice ui and ways to get into new habits, I've been using it since 2 weeks now and I am already loving it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes feel better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is definitely motivating me a lot. It does take a long time to go through the full journey so it is a big commitment. If you were like me; depressed, unmotivated, not social or active, often sick etc. Give it a shot because you have next to nothing to lose from building this step by step. I enjoy it, and recommend this to my friends aswell."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app's quite motivative as well as appealing but I guess more free- accessible options would be useful. I think increasing the number of habits that can be accessed without any subscription or payment in each routine would be helpful. I also recommend for the perfect routine suggestions to be free of cost for the betterment of the people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought the journeys were free. But oh well. I wouldn't have even gave it 1 star, if there was an option of doing so. Like bro, i have concentrating issues, i thought i can finally learn that journey, but no. You gave that behind the pay wall. Only 2 journeys are able free, for others you need to pay for it. Like bruh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Un timo! Ped√≠ la prueba gratis de un mes porque quer√≠a probar la app (y todo dentro de ella es de pago pr√°cticamente) la cual cancel√© a la semana y ahora me encuentro en mi cuenta que me cargaron 40‚Ç¨ cuando claramente LO CANCEL√â. Fatal. Y el soporte en fin, ni hablar de √©l."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"4 days in and I love it so far. I'm a mom of a 3 year old and a new born, needless to say my habits have gone down the drain! This is helping me get back on track!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is ...well... Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very helpful as a reminder during the day, good tips about habits, easy to use. Just be aware that if you don't like a lot of notifications, this app may be annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cant even use properly. I tried just for 1 task, a simple one (drink water in the morning) and i got annoyed above limits with the qestion *do you want a reminder?*.. if i dont, which I dont want a reminder for drinking water, the app asks me for a feedback *why i dont want to drink water in the morning*... I DONT WANT A REMINDER... üò°üò°üò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"NOT FREE! App informs you about ridiculous subscription fees AFTER you provide all personal data and email, dumb scam, find the power to change your life within, not through an app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üö® PLEASE BEWARE üö® Billing Nightmare I was billed $130 worth of Fabulous in a 1 month span and have received no help, lead, or support from the Fabulous Team. If you scroll down enough of the 4 or 5 stars, you'll see the issue I face pop up with many other people. If you go to Reddit, you see this billing issue as a big topic as well. Please please please DO NOT download or get the premium (which they force on you in order to use the app anyway). Please head my warning and save yourself stress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wants you to pay, not very good tracking"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! App is helpful in creating positive habits. Encouraging!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app. Helps to keep me alert and focused on my goals!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Never got to try it. It looks good but I'm not really paying ¬£4.00 a month. I thought it was free. If you made it ¬£4.00 for extra things I would use it. This app works but its focus seems to be on money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helped"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Can change lifes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I used to use this app in college and I loved it, it was great to help me on my journey to success. Somewhere along the line I reverted to old habits and I wanted to start again. They have made changes to this app and honestly, it doesn't help like it used to. They use to have more habits and walk through videos of stretches and stuff. That was really useful. The custom habits aren't that user friendly and I can seem to edit the amount if time I spend on a custom habit. Im just not as interested"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. Really helps to improve so far. And also a best companion"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Logical, planned steps you can follow. Positive energy and non-judgemental. No over promises. Very good, stimulating design. Very good coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not gonna lie, at first when I paid premium I neglected the app a little, but it's my money so I needed to make it worthy, I love this, I don't have quite a long time in it but let me tell you that I have seen progress in so many areas in my life, I started to feeling better about myself and having better relationship with others, my view of my life have change and I couldn't be more grateful, is and extraordinary tool, I highly recommend the premium Iackage, you will adore it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its simply beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually effective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Me ayuda bastante a ser autodisciplinado y de una forma bastante sencilla..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It seems a good app for me. The design is interactive and colourful. The best for me is that it gives you routine for each part of our day: morning, working day, bed time. The worst is that there is a standard for everyone, like ""drink water"" , I'm already a drinking enough water person, but the software has this standardized. The poems are not good in my opinion. A poem is an art that comes from inside people to connect with the inside of others. Maybe you should bring some artists poems."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Attractive easy to use screen display... Fitness activities... Goals... Letters... Then appreciattion in very positive way... It makes me happy. Helps me to think out of the box.. I ammmmmmm so much satisfied to have this master piece in my mobile.. I am not giving five star but yes offcourse it deserves 7 shining star‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great! The best productive app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Why is this app not on the news ? This app literally helps me change so much its unbelievable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started using this app but it's great so far. I really like how it has routines instead of just a basic check off list, it makes it easier for me to do more. Would definitely recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It works if you work it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly an amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The process and steps the app takes definitely works, but the customer service is non-existent. I've contacted support in the app about 3-4 times about a technical issue that's preventing me from moving to my next step, even though I've completed the previous and the app has marked it completed. Yet the next step is still locked. It is hard to rate the service high when you get to a point but cannot progress due to technical errors & no one who will help resolve it. Edit: Lowered to a 1 star."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App Is Really Great And Helped Me Get Everything Organized And Clean"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. So many wonderful ways of learning how to create new healthy habits in place of the old ones. I like the gentle nodges this app gives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This is for healthy people who are in 9-5 jobs, who haven't thought of their wellness before. Good introduction. The advice is very general and if it doesn't help you - nothing you can do, the app can't take to account personal differences and doesn't take feedback. I thought with the app I would create routines that fit and support ME - that's not how this works. App already has set routines that it forces you into, and if you don't do them, your journey doesn't progress. No skip button."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free! Misleading and I was signed up for the subscription without the option to click if I wanted it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, interesting story"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"From app itself, there's a good quality content there, pleasant design and approach. But it actually failed in motivating me so I stopped opening it after 3-4 days and notifications simply started irritating meü§∑. What killed my drive was that it creates you a schedule and when I just missed some part of it due to any reason it created some kind of a plan failure or unproductive day feeling. It's not an app's fault, it's just not for people who have a flexible schedule."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life once before. Im trying again and so far its working! Thank you Fabulous team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"after using the app for 1 week it says i need to pay, the app isn't even that good to spend money on i can just put reminders but i wanted something fancy üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Adds on more knowledge and health benefits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very gooooood"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only on my third day using this app, but I can tell it is really helpful already. It uses several techniques - letters, tracking your progress, meeting goals, scientific research, storytelling, music, reminders - and you start off small and easy, with just one thing at a time. Behavior change does seem possible and they've got the evidence to back up what they're selling. Now if I can keep this up, I'll be living proof as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can never sign in. When I sign in with my Google account it just sends me back to the log in page. I'm not even getting to fully use my trial to see if this will truly work for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Rip off. If you are looking for surprise billings look no further and download the app! Half a year without using the app but still being billed for the next year? No problem! They will take your money and argue with you if you dare to ask for a refund. They give no such things as notices or refunds. Before this incident I used to think the app was nice, but now I feel straight up scammed by tiny letters in their terms and conditions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is okay but one thing about the app is the alarm. Pls it should have a reminder of things to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't expected much from this app but i guess that is from bad experiences. This app is wonderfully built and gives you a lot of space to share things, helps you to connect with yourself and make a healthy routine. üß°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a SCAM! Run away! I don't know how they did it, but I worked it out, if you're trying to cancel, too! They linked my account to an email address in my deadname that I haven't used for at least 6 years, when I changed my name. How?!?! That's where the subscription was! It's a very sneaky underhanded disgisting scam, but I bet they have a line in contract somewhere for Google to let them get away with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helpfull app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seems like a good app. But really is just great marketing and terrible customer service. Maybe if they put in some work into making the app worth the high price point it would be a good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't open the app on Android! Doesn't give the options on blue screen and can't press the ""continue"" button. Says ""contents can't be autofilled"". I bought subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My experience has been interesting, fabulous and awesome. It's a good and meticulously planned app. I give you 5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good concept for an app but not enough that I would use it often and daily.Also hate the yearly subscription. I had forgotten to unsubscribe and now have been billed a full year, couldn't the app developers have designed something that could be billed monthly so that it makes it more flexible for users? Simply extortion . Awful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WATCH OUT! They will scam you w/ the free trial. I downloaded from Google play & from w/in the app signed up for the free trial. When I went to my Google play ""subscriptions"" to cancel the free trial it wasn't there. I had no idea they had me listed as starting the free trial from the web which has a whole other cancellation process!! How would I know to look for that?! Then I of course got charged so now I'm disputing it with them (difficult to find) & next my bank for fraud if they refuse!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I do really love this app, It helps me stay motivated ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great, it gives me guidance and good tips for staying on track with my goals. It actually works yall, and it's super cute to navigate. They give you a little daily meditation or encouragement piece to take with you into the day. Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is cool but too much restrictions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Started a free trial, and decided to cancel before the commencement of a yearly subscription. Charged ¬£34.99. Emailed them with proof of cancellation, and asked to be refunded. Not one single reply or acknowledgement. It's now been 16 days and I'm forced to write this message to warn others. I have no review of the app itself because I didn't need or use it for long enough. It's ironic the app tries to help our mental health but then takes customers' money and won't reply when questioned."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating app. It is really changing me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is full of positivity but very expensive don't download this everyone....REMEMBER WHEN THERE IS HIGH DEMAND FOR THIS THEN THEY WILL ALWAYS GRAB THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE MONEY...THIS APP IS SCAM!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't mention anything about premium until you're fully registered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very badüëé app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Does not always respond to daily tasks, like drinking water each morning. The app is only acknowledging the one day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good for creating a solid foundation for self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Looks like it could be a great app, unfortunately as soon as I give up my email address I am asked to subscribe to the app for a monthly fee, and even the free trial requires giving up my credit card number (to the app developers, not to google..). I managed to skip those prompts and setup a ""drink water"" routine, but after a morning routine quizz, I am again asked to subscribe. To what? Show me the value of your product before you ask for my money or my email address."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love üíï this app & injoy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app; very helpful for building habits. UX is generally pretty good across the board, but some of the UI scaling is definitely a little off, some elements intersect one another unintentionally, some don't load properly; in an app like this I feel it's important to try and get that aspect right. Also some of the pop ups in app are a little overwhelming at times and maybe limiting it to one story element at a time would be a positive move."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful art, nice music with the routine reminders for different parts of the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used to use this app and tried again today. The app is mostly fine, except it's a bit cluttered and they've DOUBLED the price since I last used it! I had to check my old receipts to be sure. Not sure how they can possibly justify doubling the subscription fee when the app is largely the same. Also I'm trying to cope with anxiety and one of the first things the app did was remind me I'm going to die someday? No thank you!! Immediately uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've done nothing for years, finally able to get myself sorted out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great way to start each day !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great! I have been pushed out of my comfort zone and crushing goals day by day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app got me to drink my water first thing in the morning...that's a huge win!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I hope to provide an Arabic version, or add language options in the application ü§çüíü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Habits are easy to follow and gets me motivated to stay on track and get things done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love iT!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps you become your true self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Recommend to all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me a ton. It's so motivational and really hypes you up. You are able to see the changes in you. Definitely works and i don't have a single complain. Great app and great people i have met there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even after cancelling subscription the amount of subscription got deducted from my credit card. No refund support available."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app, seems newer and refreshing and mindful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great way to change your patterns I am back after a year and see a big difference"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! Best by far! Changed my life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi , i have an issue with this app....i cancelled my free subscription pack before the end date and was stil charged the entire fee...i even contacted the contact us option through the app and still no help was given....i need a refund..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great apps that make me productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been a lil life saver. I've had a bad patch with my mental health. Using this app (maybe not completly in the way fully meant too, extra custom habits off the bat for work and to be more custom to myself) Its helped me get back on my feet with organising myself and being productive with my day. Probably more so than I was prior to my events. As well as adding additional things to my daily life that are beneficial and making it a regular routine/habit. Honestly brilliant üëè <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I really recommend it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"AVOID AT ALL COST: Even if I paid for a one year plan, when I tried to contact them so they can fix my subscription to the correct email, they were nowhere to be found. The 3rd time I contacted them, it said they would reply in 72h. Almost a week passed and haven't been contacted yet, just getting spammed with emails to subscribe. That's a disgrace really and an HUGE IRONY-> This app intention is to build discipline and do things in time, when they themselves aren't doing so!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Behavioral science without the clinical coldness of typical behavioral modification"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want to be more intentional about effecting changes in your life, this is the app to install. It will leave you happier, healthier, and more fulfilled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asked the customer service ro cancell my account and refund, no reply whatsoever, so disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has been amazing so far I'm really enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"only used the free version, it's more useful than other apps I've known."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very good but try add remove if we accidentally touched that right button we can just remove it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is useless unless you pay. Why even offer the free option if you're gonna try to scam us out of our money if we sign up anyway. This is honestly messed up how you e treated people with, ironically, a health and self care app. Grow a heart, scum."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am going through a really hard time with my father in hospice and it is reminding me of me. Would recommend this to everyone üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gives me a path to follow so I'm not overwhelmed by making changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, everything is going well. It's not the only app I use (I also use Finch) but they synergize well and reinforce each other. I like the slower, steady build this system has to creating good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks mates! For building such a nice app . Thanks to you many people are going to become their best selfs (me included)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love how motivating this app is, lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a hell of a app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is helping me to be productive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is GREAT!!!! I absolutely love this app it helps me make great habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app and easy to follow and understand"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I haven't used it enough to say too much, but unfortunately I don't think it's worth the high cost of the subscription to the app. Sorry guys..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I HAVE CANCELLED MY SUBSCRIPTION YET YOU ARE REPEATEDLY TRYING TO CHARGE ME EVERY SINGLE MONTH!!!! I WANT MY INFORMATION REMOVED FROM YOU RUBBISH SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY. I OWE YOU NOTHING!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app so far, , i have been using it fr three days now and i am glad i downloaded it. It sure can help create healthy habits for a healthy living if one stays true to themselves. Ps: this is the first apl i've rated a 5üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Haven't been using that long so I'll come back and rate it properly in time but right now. It's amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to help start new habits and routines!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everything was good but beware. I paid premium plan, but if you change devices, this will delete everything you have done, is not true that the backup journey plan occurs whenever the device is connected to wifi, this is a lie, a shame, and an awful user experiencie enough to throw away 4 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"First wasn't sure how this was going to go.... I am loving it!!! Just hated how much it cost!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems to be helpful but the app is hard to understand for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far it's been a mostly positive experience. One feature that I'm finding annoying is I'm unable to add things after the fact. Say I attend an event and don't get home until after midnight. I do my nightly routine and flop into bed but forget to log into the app: now it says my habit streak is broken. This is annoying because I did do my habits. I wish Fabulous would check instead of just assuming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far helping me manage my anxiety"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Extremely shady payment process. Doesn't allow you to manage your subscription within the app, doesn't make it clear how much youll get charged and when."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Easy steps and I like the daily letters."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Yeah The app is really fantastic but the subscribtion price could be low"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great concept, bad execution. Cannot customize alarms and reminders to not make any noise and be badge icons only. There's no way to 'sleep in' and the app has woken me up too many times. It needs to fit into my life for me to begin using routinely, not the other way around."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Try it and believe it..., It's really Fabulous...!!! It would be better if they have more features for free users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's fabulous app and it's really great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"a great start so far looks like it will a good journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Buy it or don't use it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only been using this app for about a week and I am already noticing change for the better in my day to day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is amazing and making my life put together again for year I been out of a schedule and this really helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Peace guaranteed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Improving my life physical health ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome so far I'm loving it, already got my to do list and all. Even got me more time to work more on my twitch streamingü§ôü§ôüí™üòé. Checkout Postedcuzull on twitch, and thank you FDRP. This is an awesome appü§ôü§ô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"√â pago..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im actually loving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Enjoyed the app for more than a year, and it helped instill good habits. However, they ended a routine today with a sexist message that also perpetuates the discredited wage gap myth. A quick trip to their Instagram revealed posts celebrating only one gender. I cannot in good conscious support the soft misandry on display. You can uplift everyone without punching down."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sets reminders for you to complete your goals. Easy to get motivated and set goals. Great way to kick start your daily routine if your having a hard time finding the energy to do so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is simply amazingüòÇü•∞it connects with the soul and tells you the truth about yourself in a comforting way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. Reminds me to drink water, excercise and stuff. 8/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely helps if you commit. I am only about a week in and already feel better. Putting my faith in God first, and using this app to help reshape my daily habbits/routine is working wonders for me. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing, brings joy, happiness, hope"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a great app for kids and adults"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great untill now. Within a week.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me alot!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have just started this program, and its cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks so so much for doing this app! It has organized my life so much! I feel really good every day with this app! Again, thank you so so so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A truly wonderful experience in helping you create better and healthier habits. This App is a must!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free app Limited Habit number for free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app just makes me happy ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçIn love with the interface. Everytime it sends me notifications i will be very curious to see what it has for me üôÇIt's like someone is really caring üòçJust love it Kudos to the entire team, who built this ü§óü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have a premium membership and my next bill is Sep 10, 2023. But today I got a notification from my bank about Fabulous tried to ""steal"" another 39.99$ from me? What's wrong with you guys?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a helpful app at reminding us to follow through on very small habits that are good for us. The reminders are encouraging and never burdensome. The meditations and morning/ evening coaching is very relaxing. I think it's worth every penny so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Helps.ypu start a good routine!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wastes your time with a long quiz only to reveal it's a subscription. Based on behavioral science indeed - only with the goal to extract as much money as possible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app, love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app very useful.And fantastic.i love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If i have money i won't need an app to improve my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging and motivating! Wish I had this app sooner! It really gets you doing healthy things without complaints!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Go through a long survey before finding it only costs money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is great. I've been using it for a year and the only irritating thing is the everyday request to share it with others. Understands the desire from Fabulous, but I stopped using it for a while because of this constant poking of sharing it with others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never received the two day reminder for canceling before trial ends. I canceled on the day it was set for renew and was still charged. Customer service is non existent. Didn't even get reminders for the tasks while I used it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could live 0 stars I would...no one from customer service has answered my numerous emails. I've canceled the free trial and the app is still attempting to charge me $39.99. Right after I had signed up for the free trial I received a very misleading email to try for 30 days instead, so I did. Turns out it's still only 7 and I only found out because they were trying to charge me. Be careful if you sign up, they obviously don't care about the customer after they get their card information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This ks nice, because it can help me organized my schedule or task properly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Easy and Simple!! I Love It"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've never felt like an app could give you a hug until I downloaded Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it is helpful to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's really nice app but can't I use it for freeüòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I have been using it for a week now, but I feel like I can stick to the habits for long periods of time. The habits start small, but can have big impact."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Please make the achievement sound quieter! It's disturbing, especially during night time routine. For some reason it's like three times louder than anything else, it makes me flinch every time and that's the opposite of what i plan to achieve with this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good aap"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gave me more insight and helped me realize thing I didn't before and it's only the first day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have canceled and yet you continue to try to charge my card. This is a scam. Your phones default app can do what this app does. Don't even try it! You can't cancel in app or cancel the subscription through google play. They make it almost impossible to cancel and then charge you anyway. I dont how is benefiting from this app, its a scam. Avoid avoid avoid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even let me use a free week without getting my bank account info. üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a paid app, only your first week is free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"üòé üÜíÔ∏è üòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My life is gradually becoming fabulous‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüòä"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam :(( I was charged for the one year subscription and lost access to my premium membership randomly. I tried multiple times to get my membership restored and was never successful. Update! 1 year later and they charge me again! I don't have any accounts that show I own the service and can't get help to figure out why I'm being charged for something I don't have amd haven't had for over a year. The customer service is horrible. It's impossible to get in contact with a real person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would like to add more of my personal habits but that's alll"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow, just wow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! It's got some interesting content that embraces tiny wins. Still figuring out how everything works though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely easy and inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ok this app is the best app I have ever added to my phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing routine planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the app tho some options are a bit pricey for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps a lot with habit forming. I love the motivational content I can listen to or read, including workout activities, mental reminders, meditation and healthy challenges. It has you set daily routines and you feel rewarded for forming habits. I do feel kinda bad if I skip a habit every once in awhile but idk if you can fix that for me lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"cant afford membership but i think the app is fine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"TRIGGER WARNING: if you have ever struggled with disordered eating, this app is full of triggering language, which cannot be avoided, even if you do not choose any goals related to eating or dieting. This is the only habit builder app I could find that fit my budget. But I do not anticipate resubscribing and cannot recommend it. If you can afford a more expensive app, do not use Fabulous. If more traditional ways of habit building and tracking have not failed you recently, do not use Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's cute, it does get me a little bit by talking to me like how I talk to clients...I guess I'm a sucker a little bit lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the gentle coaching. I WANT to do the things requested and feel comfortable adding to it gradually. Thank you, Best Purchase All Year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just seems so confusing and full cheap ploys that get you to do their advertising for them. Constantly asking you to send stuff to get data off of you contacts. Get rest and take care of yourself and you won't need this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lost my time to fill in blanks and at the end they tell you its paid just start with that and don't waste our time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app .I recommend every one because you can find yourself better than before."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! The user experience is great. I love the graphics üòç"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app truely changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing! It does so much and has really kept me on track with my routines. I canceled the trial and afterwards, I felt lost. My mornings or evenings weren't the same without my routines. I didn't know how much I needed it up until this happened. I appreciate this app so much more now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's a decent app but it's a bit slow to get through all the screens and very notification heavy. The 2 stars is mostly because of how awkward and obtuse unsubscribing is. I'd have given it 4 stars if only unsubscribing could be done in the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has such beautiful art üòç in love with how it helps you take baby steps to better & help find your best self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app. It isn't in your face about the goals you set and the story it tells as you go along is really engaging. I also find it motivating because to see the next part tomorrow I have to do all my tasks. And you are allowed to manage how many tasks you have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interactive and promising at this point."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought it is free with some premium features but it is not. It jas only a 7-day trial period. I just uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my free trial, still got charged. Contact customer support about the refund still didn't get any reply. Later edit: got a few late replys like As mentioned by my Teammate, we can see that the subscription renewed on May 18, 2022 5:55 AM EDT, and you cancelled until May 18, 2022 10:07 AM EDT. It didn't say anything about specific time but specific date. Bummer..."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Exploitative scumbags. Doing everything in their power to get you to buy an yearly subscription because they're not confident in the product keeping you for that long, and making it as hard as possible to cancel the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth buying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was SO excited to use this app. I downloaded it and clicked on it a while later and of course it's all about money. I couldn't even get a free trial without my payment information. Why is it that all the apps that can hurt you are free and the ones that are supposed to help you cost money. If people are struggling enough to download this app they are probably also struggling financially. But you don't care about that right ? I know it's 40$ a year but come on. You don't actually care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like it so far going into it slow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is lovely.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is so mentally uplifting which I didn't expect, it helps me achieve goals gradually so I don't get too overwhelmed. The app functions really well, I can tell a lot of thought goes into keeping it working well. I love it! I'm on day 3 and I'm going to keep going when the 7 day free trail is up. Its $39 for a year if you're wondering. Just do it. Get the App. Do the thing, you'll love it ‚òï‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's pretty damn cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has soothing voices that read pieces of information should you choose not to read it solo. It has so mnay easy habit building skills that are useful in sustaing real growth and change. The cost is low and the benefits have already proven ro make a difference."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It truly makes adding new routine things easy. The voices doing the readings are wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it actually helped me build up habits and feel more energized and better about myself. I usually couldnt stay motivated and do my goals, but this app really pushed me and Im happy with the results."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Lovely app the paid features are amazing keep it up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Overall it's good when you want to keep things simple but also consistent. More complexities though are hard to create and not a lot of customization to tailor it to my specific needs, such as a routine on a Tuesday morning only instead of every morning automatically. It's a good app but there is a lot of room for improvement and I haven't seen them make much progress from the feedback their members have been saying both in and out of the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was hestitant to use the app. Didn't believe it would help. But it actually is fun and a great motivator. I have been using for 2 weeks and it is great! I have been feeling waaaay better and started great habits! My mind is calmer and my body n mind happier"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've just finished my 7 days trial and enjoyed the journey so far. It seems to have a lot of scattered paths and information, but I think I will be able to make use of it. There's one specific thing that annoys me a lot after those 7 days passed and they automatically withdrew the money for a year subscription. I keep receiving notifications that I have 3 months of free subscription left to use, but I can't do anything with it as I've already purchaise a year subscription. Why would you do it??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's quite an amazing app it has changed my life for what I'm hoping the better :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever makes stay focused on my studies and makes me drink water üíû I've never seen a app like this ever in my life thanks for developing this app keep it up <3 :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please consider a monthly payment option, I will then convert to 5 star. 22 month may be hard on some."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bro this app is so sensational. It's so peaceful and leaves a person at peace. It's definitely my new home when I need an escape from reality"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its going good ive improved alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless compared to many other apps, expensive, intrusive videos"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keep up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a total scam!!!!!! $300 for a ""lifetime"" membership.... WHAT???? DO NOT USE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome! I used to be flexible with my wake up time and then I would struggle to get a morning routine in before I had to start the rest of my day. But the very first habit of having water by the bed and drinking some right away when my alarm goes off makes me able to think about and overcome my urge to keep sleeping. The app is helping me keep my commitments to myself. It's making me a new person one small step at a time. I definitely recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Soo good is this app i can finally do my things which I was not able to do even without premium you can use this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has helped me focus for once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is so good as I ever seen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It has helped me. Great tool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not bad. Easy to follow and positive reinforcement. I like it. Okay a week or so in and I think I. Gonna delete the app. This damn thing is so pushy, every time I open the app there is at least one ad to sign up for premium. Just now I had three. The relentless pushy approach has worn off the genuine nature of this app. Sure it'll help.... but for a price. That's not help, that's profit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SIGN UP OR PUT YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION, THIS WILL CHARGE YOU ALMOST A YEAR LATER THEN NOT LET YOU GET A REFUND!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unable to downloading the app onto my phone, already payed. Will not meep it if I have to search for it on Google. I tried to cancel the app then restart, it will not download onto my phone...help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it! It's been a great help with everyday life and just the little things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app it helps create habits in an interactive way for both mental physical and general habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam, don't try the free trial as they will charge you even if you cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to give it a try but I'm not giving my cc just to try the trial to see if I like it. Kind of disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pede muita informa√ß√£o desnecess√°ria"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Starts small and is very structured."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm three days in so far and is hard for me to fault the app at this but it is early days. I'm really enjoying the process so far and the app is really helping to remind of healthy habits and new retuines. I think it's awesome and looks forward to continuing my journey üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"tried to delete/disable my account. it is impossible. the website is absolutely broken and there is no disable account button on the app anymore. even if i did actively use this app it sends you emails every few hours, so you come back home from a day of work and it's all spam. terrible, don't recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the stories...and how it's all built-in üíô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"6 days using it and it's been helpful. As someone with ptsd, the pandemic hit me even in habits so I've been struggling to get back on track, i like that this app encourages you in gentle ways so you don't rush it and enter in anxiousness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Always starting and stopping this journey. The app really helps when I am not bedridden. Anyone who has trouble unsubscribing, do so in the Google Store. It works perfectly there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually is helping me rebuild myself alot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've never been so much better then useal, Helps with sleep,food, motivation,and alot more like breathing LOVE IT."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Sorry many reminders! I've even shut them off and they still go off constantly! Yes, I want the alarm for the wake up routine, NO, I don't want reminders on everything else. I don need to be reminded about finishing a routine when I'm in the middle of finishing the routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app..kind of it let's me focus on the task in hand.. plus gives me mental peace nd I'm satisfied that what I wanted to do so far..is actually getting done... thnx to fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app i ever used it made feel so motivated and consistent and since it starts with small changes it's easy to archive the challenge and i feel so proud even about the smallest things i would totally recommend for those who want to change their lifestyleüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app helps me start becoming a new person and have gained way more than I expected, cool stories each day makes my day better :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable! You have to allow them to download your fingerprint to access the app! Then, even though I clearly stated I didn't want mail, they are already sending me mail. When I try to contact them, I have to give them my fingerprint (allow them to download it) in order to intitiate the contact process. This should be illegal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I dont havr constant access to internet connection so its not as what it should be but its fine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've seen a lot of improvement even I 9nly have this app for a week! I will definitely buy the premium and make it a lifestyle! Before you download the app make sure you are determined to change your life for the better and this app is a great tool for it! Have beautiful day people! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's getting me into my routines ready for the day and the next!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great Application. And Great Me as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app. This is the most consistent I've been in making healthy habits stick."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!! Awesome and unique"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It‚Äôs awesome.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to teach you how you progress slowly towards your habitual zone.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't had it very long but so far I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You can set up your subscription payment in the app, but to cancel it you have to go to the website, which is complete broken. And all you get for your uncancelable subscription is reminders to drink water and have a good breakfast."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bug report: I like the app but since I bought a pixel 6, when the bubble (Facebook's messenger style) notification appears, makes the bottom quarter of the screen completely nonresponsive, and can't use it in any way, I need to close to dismiss the notification and restart the phone to work again. Really annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app is really inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the best app I no other words"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its great. Have 7 day free tiral"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The words don't fit the screen so I can't read half of what it says"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dog water. Can't stand free apps that require a subscription to use. Waste of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app, however... it's frustrating starting from day 1 because I forget to check in. Also the little story/cartoon that was given after each day has just stopped. I'd like to find out what happened after I reached the camel???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the most uplifting app for self-growth I've encountered. The goals are easy, slow, and doable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Though very good, it's enemy of the data. Within 3 hours, it has consumed 430 mb data. Horrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making a difference in my sense of well being. Fabulous is Helping me open my mind and heart, to actually change my mind about myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying the coaching sessions and habit building."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I really like it... It keeps me going on the right direction and where I want to be. I'm a usually person who is losing motivation quickly and with this app I managed to keep going now for almost a week and that means a lot to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is honestly beautiful to say the least but some things within this app are silly to put a limit on if you don't have premium. I just downloaded this as I'm a massive procrastinater and I was making some routines.. I found there's a limit to adding stuff to routines?? I think this is quite silly and it really limits what you can do. This app is meant to help with routines but you can't even personalise one?? Quite a waste of time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good Fabulous app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app was good after a couple of days but after canceling my subscription it keeps charging me, I have no idea why, I removed my card, checked the app store to remove it and the card, emailed, researched, nothings worked, what do I do?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terribly annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I honestly really like this app. I'm terrible at making a plan and sticking to it, and while my ""journey"" had been anything but perfect, it has been way more frequent and consistent than when I used to do it by myself. The only thing I don't like is that there are quite a few notifications and I can't figure out how to mute some of them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the third time to have this app. The first time I was able to pay for a year. I loved it so much. It's not as good this time, only because I'm not able to get the premium right now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this is dogshit ""just pay us and we'll change your life"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app so far! Even convinced my Husband to download it! üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Finally , I found best app for best and optimized habits. Thank you too much! Deserve 5 stars ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helped me. I have paid for version so can't comment on ads in the unpaid one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asks too many questions and it seemed like I have to pay a premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Awesome app, sunshine in my life, absolute must haveüôèüèΩüíó, then it got too much had to get ridüò≥"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asking for money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow I have changed a LOT"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems like just what I've always looked for but it gave the impression of free app until I did the info and fingerprint, only then was told it's ""free trial, payments due bla bla"" don't mind paying if good product, but the shifty way it was done makes it sus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still new to this. Grateful they start out with easy and simple goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled immediately. I did not see that it was going to cost so much after only a week. I can't afford it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far, after 1 week, it's done well to remind me to drink water in the morning. It builds good habits over time, adding new ones when existing ones are repeated a few times, but it doesn't seem to have a way to skip through the basics and aknowledge and incorporate the good habits that someone already has. Because of this, it feels very hand-holdy in the beginning. Maybe I already eat breakfast and go for a morning walk, but now I have to prove that to the app before moving past that point."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute scam! I canceled my subscription in May and yet I was charged again today."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Confusing and spammy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect scientific habit/routine building"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it, pricing in app does not match any place you can actually get billed. And hounds you for $40 commitment off the bat. No free trial without the financial information. Very bad practice. Somehow deleted my journey so didn't get to really utilize that, couldn't find it to restart. Circles look intriguing but don't have much activity to keep me engaged. Reminders are not loud enough to be noticed. Overall I've done everything that this app does through free or one time purchase apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has truly made a difference I'm a short period of time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Doesn't affect your habits at all. Misleading: States a monthly subscription, but charges a yearly one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app ! It's very supportive and helps you to get healthy habits. If I could I would love to subscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is great but as many have said, they have disgusting practices regarding payment and their support team just ignore you. Have been charged twice for a yearly subscription I didn't even want and there's pretty much no way of getting a response from them. Avoid, avoid, avoid"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to cancel. Repeatedly trying to charge my debit card even when I changed the number. Seriously steer clear of inputting any person info. Horrible customer service. No return response from any contact me departments"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Heard about this in a youtube ad and tried it out. Was going to just try the free trial. Everything in the app is scattered and I feel like it's hard to focus on one thing. The motivational videos are cringe. You have to log in on a computer just to cancel the subscription and can't do it through your phone. Uninstalled the app while my 40$ subscription was still going."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just the motivation I needs to create my best life one step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very very good for stressful thing it can help a lot of people üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëêüëêüëê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It will help you achieving your daily goals and soon u will realize you are totally changed into what u want"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't tell you you need to pay for a premium subscription until you've set up all your preferences. If this was part of google play pass I wouldn't mind so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING!! Do not use this app!Absolute disgrace from the app developer. They dont send you a notification that the trial period is ending, as stated the app will do once trial period has ended. The is no way of stopping the subscription or trial run on the app and when you request the refund they make you look bad!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy start with simplest routines, a lot of good background info why those roitines make sense - but the best is whenever you achieve those simolest tasks, the app will lead you to the next step of your personal Growth! My tip (from experience, not intended but helpful): Register and start using the app on a day something really good happened to you. This eay, the enthusiasm will kickstart your motivation. I met a great girl and on that day I comoleted all goals, and now writing the review)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Overengineering if it was an app. If you want to start a habit, just start it and stick with it. These apps are not a hack. Do the work. Trust me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not easy to use and does not motivate you! Also don't sign up they will get you for a year even is you decide not for you in 1 month( wanted to give it a chance). Don't do it!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really motivates you to accomplish your goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very visual and intuitive. Really helps me track my wake up and night routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's very cute, helpful and treats task building like a game with achievements, but i am not a fan of the price just yet, I might give the uear pass a try soon and see if its worth it. The week trial is not enough time to see if it works for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only a week in & have been creating habits so easily. Definitely worth the $40/year if you have trouble staying on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Received an invite for a free 30 days trial, wanted just to see if it's what I want, if it's what I'm looking for.... But I got somehow charged of 39. 99 USD, without being asked or agreed. So I really hope that I'll get the money refunded, applied 2 days ago, still no answer. I feel disappointed to be honest, I see that I'm not the only one that happened this, did anyone get their money back? üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app isn't great and the customer service is bad. I ended up on the free trial and it renewed, so I thought I would give it a shot. was certain I canceled it before yearly auto renewal. I guess it didn't go through because I got charged 40 dollars again. Canceled again. Reached out immediately to customer service and got the T&C speech. Don't give this app a chance because they certainly don't give you any consideration after you've signed up, even if you haven't used it much at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app so far! There's a few things I wish could've been added but other than that its great! Simple easy app. Makes my daily routines easy and enjoyable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"If you use it, I assume it's a good app. Although I didn't commit to the process, I uninstalled it because it repeatedly prevented me from using any other app until I completed an activity. If I didnt manage the activity bubble correctly, I'd have to restart my phone to close the activity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app today and I was offered a free 7 day Premium trial. Once I gave my card details, I was charged the full amount immediately. On their website, my account info says I will be charged in 7 days from now. I tried to speak with someone but I could only send a refund request that can take 10 working days to be answered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app High recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the Best App you can get"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be aware. They charge you 41,99‚Ç¨ per year and the value you get is zero. Too many notifications, lots of clutter, wrong approach. Better to read a book like ""Tiny habits."". Change your behaviour through self-motivation not with your phone that might already dictate your life with notifications. I forgot to cancel and cannot get my money back (Thanks...) I am warning you here. Don't give into whatever motivation spike you're having now that pushes you to buy this app. Be smarter than me. üöÆ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it, gives me the motivation I need to be a better version of me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous üòÑüòÉüëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Soo good app for making routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous eases you into healthy daily habits by offering reminders, encouragement, and helpful suggestions every day. I didn't expect the app to be as useful as it has been. After just one month I'm sleeping better, eating better, and motivated to begin exercising on a daily basis. Fabulous is the perfect app for anyone who struggles with consistency and enthusiasm when it comes to healthy living."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Has potential although hard to follow with multiple things scattered throughout the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it so far, though I am only a few days into it. Prior to using the app I was just putting a task list into my phone but this is a lot more fun and definitely helps me to grow at a pace I can realistically accomplish, even as a single mom, full-time student and part-time freelancer (I just have to ignore any advice around sleep right now üòÇ)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was around in the very beginning, but the goals weren't what I was trying to achieve. Today this app has expanded into nearly all areas of life. It's wonderful to see how much you have grown and helped the world ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The way they have designed the app is amazing, though slow it's sure that you will make eventual progress if u follow as per needed. I'm still jus 4 days in and I can feel that my life has changed in a slight manner. That too jus with the free version, they've even got a premium version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Supporting and genuinely approaching me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Extremely pushy about providing my credit card info (not using a trusted system like Google subscriptions). And way before I'm willing to pay. I can set up a reminder to drink water without this app, and also I do not want a reminder to drink water. I drink ....when I'm thirsty. ü•≤"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful app. I have the ha it to drink water every morning. The app now pushes me to log that (what I already do) to unlock the next thing - breakfast. Guys, I have methabolic syndrome and I am on intermittent fasting past several years to keep on track. Why there is no way to skip the ""challenges"" irrelevant to you?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. It's a wonderful way to build habits and is worth the premium price of around $6.00 a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One if the worst app ever , they charged me 40 $ and didn't upgrade my account, and for over a month still couldn't reach any one from to talk about this problem"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it feels like a fun game that actually helps me stick to my routine üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app but the prices should be low."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying this valuable tool. I am relearning self care and creating new positive habits. Change is a process taken in small steps repeated over time. I love the motivational and educational aspects of the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Placa se, naravno. Besplatno skines posle te naguze za pare üòÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience with a very wide range of fields to help build on resilience, discipline, habits for success, health and wholeness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Life changing üôåüòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good a00"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I actually look forward to using this app each day. The morning and evening readings really speak to me. I've struggled a long time trying to make various life style changes all at once and end up getting overwhelmed and failing. This app has helped me to make consistent baby steps in all the areas I want to make changes and not beat myself up or fall off track completely when I've had a period of inconsistency."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried a trial, didn't like it, can't cancel my trial before I'm billed. Their support team will not get back to me. They better issue refunds for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is great, but... This app is so good above all. It provides any kinds of audio intentions, yoga, even meditation, but there are 3 things it needs to improve : Widget, Ideas (please give us more initiatives of goals), calendar + task in app. So it will be 1 app for all. Others than that, it's just so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using for 4 days so far. Impressive. If you want an all-in-one life coaching app that inspires, teaches, and gives you a habit tracker, very slowly and gradually, taking only a few minutes a day, then this app does a great job. If you just want a supplemental app and want to manage your own habit tracker separately, not sure if this app could be used effectively that way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Rich content, practical advise"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They scammed me out of money after I requested a cancellation. No one from the office ever reached out during that week. Beware you will never see your money if you enter your credit card information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a bait and switch. They ask you a lot of questions and then just tell you to drink water to be healthy. Also you can't cancel in the app, you have to try to find the website, And they don't tell you where it is. Once you get to the website, you can't log in or find your account to cancel. I'm glad I used a disposable credit card and killed it before they could charge it, because there's no way for me to cancel my account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Bit confusing to begin with, hoping to find advice and support finding my purpose"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Quality app with real benifits if u have the will. Great job guys you made a wonderful application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing. I don't use the premium, but even without it, it is still an awesome app. Thank you so much for this app! üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am really experiencing good changes in my life. Becoming more disciplined and schedule adhering person. Hope to do immensely well in the near future in finding a ""new me"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good app but I'm disgusted that a wellness app like this has such a disgustingly difficult method for cancelling subscriptions. I'm building a new habit list for the rest of my life. Task 1. Never subscribe to fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Much work, efford and mind are put in this app. It helped me form several valuable habits. Recommended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app..It has totally helped with my mental health! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The only thing I don't like is the advertising for products. See water bottle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not clear this is an annual subscription. I've not been using this app and now ¬£40 has left my account. No reminder that the subscription will get renewed, no option to cancel, nothing. I'm not happy, I'd like a refund, and to uninstall this app as I'm not using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"excelent follow up in your daily routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I absoulutly love this app though the reason 4 star is because of the premium adds other than that it is excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This game is the best If you forgot something this game will remind youüíïüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"To begin with I thought it was a bit cheesy. Opening the advice and guidance has actually been really useful. I'm learning a lot and I'm starting to enjoy it now rather than rolling my eyes when a notification comes up to check in. It's good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So Far So Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like everything about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried canceling my subscription but the app was making it very difficult to cancel! I had to email for customer support where it would take 10 business days for them to reply. Two weeks passed and never was contacted back. I've sent multiple emails as well. Got charged on my card, and still can't seem to reach them for a refund. Very aggravating!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ü§©...It bring a lot of healthy habit in me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app that has really changed my perception on healthy habits! It starts you off with small goals that you can achieve and over time it gives you the momentum and willpower to conquer more difficult habits. A must try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it, I found a free app to help with a lot of stuff. Worst is I had paid for full year and didn't use the app as it doesn't have anything to use. On multiple requests I am not even getting a refund. Very disappointed. Please don't pay them, find a free app for use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Hard to get your head round at first but habits are forming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's helpful for building good habits with proper guidance and techniques. I hope to have a free version soon."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless. I have no problem maintaining a good diet or exercise routine, those are habits I already have locked down, but despite making that clear in the opening quiz, it still won't let me 'unlock' the habits I actually want to pickup until I spend weeks doing things like 'drinking water' and 'eating breakfast'. Topped off with a patronising 'letter' telling me all the bad habits they assume I have, and how they'll help. Why even have the quiz at the start if it's ignored?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app to help me organize my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, it contains allot of usful information to use to help us traverse this rocky world"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had a good experience initially and paid for the premium membership. But then my premium subscription was cancelled for no reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app i have ever seen this app helps me to be productive and energetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏èü§óüòçüòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app it's really helping me <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Help achieve your set targets"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This has helped me maintained a routine I have fallen off of. The reminders and ways to set the goals for the night and day have been helpful for staying accountable. Don't like the ads though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for creating good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app tried many and for a small fee have found this app keeps me going with different challenges and self power advice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing experience with fabulous , you got what you need like motivations, reminders,information about what you eat and how it affects you , a story all along, i really like this app üëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was charged for a year, nothing showed in Google subscriptions and I thought I had cancelled during trial but apparently not. You have to go on PC and cancel via a bunch of BS. Tried to use chat/support on their website but kept getting the response ""I am sorry - I was not able to understand your request"" even though I was using their responses/links & not writing anything myself. Eventually got in contact via email but after 'careful consideration' they refused a refund. Very unfortunate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It feels like a coach is right next to you, very supportive and continues to challenge me daily"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love having something to keep myself in check also so much helpful advice an programs Love it üòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app will SING the song of it's people LOUDLY as soon as it's installed. Gave my husband sleeping next to me a heart attack and wouldn't stop for quite a while. Yikes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying it so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Must add card smh.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"too all over the place..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems OK but it's over priced, only offers a 7 day free trial and keeps asking you to invite your friends. 4 of the first 7 days are just drinking 1 glass of water. Did not seem like a game changer for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I was a bit skeptical as I have tried similar apps before but this one is the real deal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is beautiful. WELL thought out, but I find it condescending. This app will assume you don't know how to hydrate, eat well, or move your body. It should be made clear in the verbiage about this app that it's for entry level beginners. It's a very good concept & has beautiful art work! Stunning really. I found no way to adjust my ""journey"" It assumes further that I have a poor attitude & so will also tell me how I need to amend my thinking. Honestly it's like being mansplained to!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is amazing !!! I wish it was free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's still the trial period but so far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has given me the steps, guidance and support to make changes for the better. I love the challenges and the coaching. I will be using this app for a long time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far is helping me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good in theory, but super shady subscription wise. I spent ¬£2 on a 14 day premium trial and it took ¬£35 out of my account at the end of it. I had a huge panic attack, emailed the company, and have heard literally nothing back. The subscriptions it shows you when signing up for a cheap TRIAL are super complicated as it's discussing two prices at once - how much you'll pay now AND once your 2 weeks are up. All this self help app has done is make me fearful of other self help style apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a great helper if you want to change your lifestyle!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Con: my free trial expired and it auto paid a membership. That's on me, but companies that see honest mistakes like that and use it for their own gain rub me the wrong way. I tried cancelling the auto pay as soon as I signed up for the trial. Usually that's a good way to actually be able to try the product without worrying about missing the cut off date. I didn't follow through because the wording made it seem like it would cancel the free trial as well. So I gave them a chance anyway."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lifechanger. I've been using the app since 09/2021 and I've made so much progress with it! Very efficient, easy-to-use, simple, yet convenient. My new best friend! Thank You, coaches, developers, and everyone on Fabulous staff!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes habit forming fun, easy, and rewarding!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription before my trial ended and i still got charged! Do not use!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is not working, subscription is hidden to unsubscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I still haven't felt much change, but of course I'm more energetic now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It demands you to put in your credit card to use a free 7 day trial along with your email and asks for a fingerprint. I used my knuckle. None of this is stated upfront when the app loads or in te discription. I want my email and info deleted from your database. Its a scam. For those trying to get refunded ask your bank to do a chargeback."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just started using this app..I thought it would have a way to enter my everyday calendar like 1.get up 2.drink water Morning routine 1.take a shower 2.get ready for your day a. brush teeth, Hair, makeup,get dressed. Ect. 3.eat breakfast 4.meditate And so on. But I'm following along I could use some new healthy habits. I'm game. We'll see what happens. Jacki"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I'm sure it works great but I can't get past that you do all the intro stuff only to find out you have to pay for it. Once I saw that I uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an app that establish habits and suits my tastes for a looong time, and this one is perfect! It has lit everything. It helps you get healthy habits! Just in love with Fabulous üòª"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic motivation app, highly recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, this is *everything* I have been looking for in the journey to upgrade my programming and become a more authentic, productive me. It is highly customizable, with solid science and bit sized bits of information to help you address whatever ""issue"" you want to work on within yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you're looking for something to motivate you, this app is awesome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to start a routine! Ive started a couplr days ago and im loving it! Would reccomend for sure!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really am loving this app more and more every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best self-improvement app ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"LOVE the interface and how it pushes you to get your goals done. Incredible app. 4 stars just because you can't pay monthly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only have been using it for a week but has brought change in my morning almost instantly, but remember only you can do this, the app will make good suggestions but when it comes down to it, you have to choose if your ready to make change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This application make me feel motivated I love ittt"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is not for me want to cancel subscription but they made is so difficult.. sent 2 messages still no reply"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started using the app this week. Love it so far! I do think it needs easier ways to edit routine settings and a way to change the alarm tones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth spending time on this app rather than any other social media... A guide to forming new habits and building a better self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app that helped me get back on the track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is best app for.your healt and routine make install no.problem"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I hate apps that want you to pay for a subscription service when they're already selling our data. Greedy AF"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Will not respond tomy help request s"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the app and am not interested and so I canceled it prior to the end of the free trial. And yet they continue to try to charge me for it, despite me requesting that they stop."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lush and beautifully helpful app üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using for around four days, never drank enough water, this app is definitely useful for self improvement ‚úåÔ∏è tried many others this is one of the best üíØ Took a while but I'm back on the Fabulous Flex üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßñ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëå"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I suggest everyone to install this app its life changing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I feel like I'm being grilled by the FBI. Tons of questions, data collection etc... + the app pretty much just tries to get me to get more sleep. Appeals to ""science"" quick fixes like drink more water are insulting. What am I, a 2 year old?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and good insight love the reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you struggle with negative thoughts, routines or self care this app will help you to build a foundation to healthier choices and new thought patterns. To be transparent I don't always complete the activities. When im anxious I tend to feel fear and avoid even simple tasks. I like that the app provides encouragement and reminders. May seem silly but in the low times little bits of support even from an app can make a difference."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well organized and intuitive as well as genuine benefits delivered. Been using it for over 5 years now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very supportive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I do not recommend this app, they take your money without notifying you... it is really disrespectful... I canceled my subscription and they still took my money... be very careful because when you claim and send emails you do not receive any response....I feel very sad and frustrated at not being able to communicate with it...since they just ignore meüò†üò†"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to use everyday! It helps me set daily routines and sends me inspirational material to reflect on. It really has made me more mindful of my daily life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent for so Far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i actually started crying at the ""future me"" talking to me, explaining that she's healthy thanks to me, all that talk. that really says alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It feels rewarding to complete daily mundane tasks, gives you the science on building that habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great, simple yet comprehensive!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it is very very effective for me, i am being calmed now and focus and motivated, thanks to my friends that give me this apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Decent material, but forces you to go to web to canc premium. Extra unnecessary steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a very well put together program, one of the few I feel will work for me. So far so good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great so far. Simple steps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app itself is ok, but I dislike the company practices/cognitive dissonance. They give you ONLY a 7-day trial. When the trial is over, AFTER YOUR ACCOUNT IS CHARGED, they send you a trial extension & require you to jump through hoops to get your $ back in order to take advantage of the ""extended trial"". A bunch of bollocks. Obviously, they should be sending you the email for a trial extension well before your bank account is charged the $44. VERY OFF-PUTTING, to say the least."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app special feature is their story telling daily about hurdles"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is very functional and enjoyable so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 days of good habits so far. This is really helping me take baby steps out of this depression hole I've been in for over a year. Time will tell how far it will help me go. I have great hopes for this tool. Feels like someone is there holding my hand to find the light inside me and help it shine. Sounds so corny, I know, but people really underestimate the power of self care... And the creators of this app get it. 5 STARS! Zero ads. Cheap 3 bucks a month for premium. Very well spent change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Builds you up to be your best self!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good appüòç than other apps. Help to get improvement in your personality. If you use it effectively, then you see changes in your lifeüëç You wanna try this, If you want to see improvement in your lifeüòçüòé‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm very skeptical when it comes to anything marketed toward productivity or self-help. But this is the real deal. It guides you on a long journey of positive habits like staying hydrated, eating breakfast, exercising, etc. And you can mix/match whatever habits you want even if they're not part of the journey (their word) it starts you on. Progress is slow and measured. The steps are based in scientific study. It gives quotes and articles that help you find what's most important to you. Try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíú‚ö°üåû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I took a 7 day trial, however was charged $63 straight away!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not bad, I have lost some bad habits with it, but I like the challange features, but I'd highly recommend buying the ""premium"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"do helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and so helpfulk"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Frustrated from the moment I started. The very first challenge it tried to make me do was something I already did and I had no way to get around it. I wasn't able to explore or customize my challenges at all, just had to follow along with what it told me to do. Not at all what I thought it would be like."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app. But the price tag for a year it's so expensive for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works. I've committed to the process and it's having a positive impact for me. I've continued with the Premium membership after the free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far it's been great motivator"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: DO NOT USE THIS APP, IT IS A SCAM. THERE IS NO WAY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK. If I could give zero stars I would. I bought the hype so I installed this app. After a few days I canceled. It wasn't worth my time or money. But much to my surprise, the app took my pretrial sign up info and charged me after I canceled. And then to put the cherry on top, blocked me from even trying to get into the app again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP IT IS A SCAM FOR MONEY."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its sound track is beautiful leading to a calming journey"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a really useful app. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. And I'm glad I did! üëçüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was excited to use this but has some bugs, e.g. My challenges to drink water and have a healthy breakfast never complete even though I have done them for 3 days - they just show the button to accept the challenge as if I've never started. Some view of calendar days would be helpful to keep track of when we started the journey and where we're at"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app for productivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it but I want to have more habits on the app, but the app its self is nice I like it but I hate that it glitches by showing me that I have a workout routine and yesterday it showed me it on the side of my screen I and I got so mad cuz I couldn't move it out of my screen and the other day I was doing my exercise and then when I finished it started to glitch and it keeped showing me a glitch and the I tried restarting and but I did not work so the I tried deleting and it finally worked üòÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It sounded so promising but I guess just not what I was looking for. A 2 minute quiz maybe can't tell you that no, I'm not waking up at 3am to work out/shower when my baby was waking me up at 2 am. Life isn't one size fits all, I was expecting more actual coaching with premium. Has a lot of groups you could engage with, that wasn't for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you wanna change your life style by doing little effort go for this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the app so far. Early days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Price too high. Found reasonable app for better price."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Update: I did receive customer service and a refund. Terrible customer service. No warning when annual renewal comes up. No phone number. No response to support ticket almost 2 weeks ago. App itself was mediocre."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't subscribed yet but already I can observe positive change in my behavior. Realistic goals and tips."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I adore itüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription before the trial period ends but money still got deducted. Now customer support is not replying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've recently started my journey for good habits and let me tell you this app is a lifesaver. It breaks down everything from explaining why to how to get things done and changing your life for the better with tiny baby steps! Theres so many little reminders and so many ways to help you work throughout the process. It's super interesting, cute, and informational and 5/5 recommend even though I've yet to finish my journey :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a pleasant experience - helpful tips with a steady pace."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Payment at first. Didn't gave me trial as well! Horrible experience.. Edit: I'm using it again and it's beautiful! Though there are payment for some stuff but still appreciate it! ( Íàç·¥óÍàç)"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is very simple to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Keeps trying to steal money ! THIS APP EVEN AFTER CANCELLING THE SUBSCRIPTION still tries TO STEAL MONEY OF YOUR ACOUNT...BE AWARE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Encouraging mental excercises that remind us to make the most of our lives. Live healthy and happy. Aquire goals. If you're feeling uninspired it will help you see that little changes inbehaviour can add up to big changes in your environment."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredibly simple, incredibly effective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful for those struggling with anxiety, depression, tough times, or even just need some motivation to get through the day. My anxiety and depression has been extremely severe, and I just needed to get my life back together in an organized, helpful, and healthy way. This app definitely is helping me do so by checking up on me, and helping me find what works best for me in coping with my anxiety and depression."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's a good app, I'm not gonna lie, but only if you're paying. It has a limited number of challenges, and you can't create customized challenges by yourself. And like I said, you have to pay for most of the features that makes this app useful, if your using it for free is barely a check list."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gold digger üëé"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good motivation to take care of your physical and mental health! I look forward to it every morning!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful program"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Quite a good experience, this team is nursing its product with remarkable care; but I don't think it's worth the sum they ask for a monthly subscription. These fitness and self improvement people are incredibly greedy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love the app it realy dose help with mental health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app for the most part. However, I can only add four tasks to a routine without having to get premium, it would be nice to be able to add more. Other than that, it's really good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have a hard time remembering that my own needs are important. This app is the gentle reminder that i need to get me healthy, inside and out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspiring. This app gives such little tasks but make me feel so accomplished for doing them that I just want to do another task. Then when it gives me more I feel even more Intrested and Inspired to continue. App was broken, Couldnt play coaching. This is fixed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm debating between four and five stars. I initially wanted to give it four, but I think that's because I wish the app moved along with the program faster. However, maybe the developers of this app know better than me. I'm on Premium and the app design is beautiful. User experience is also top notch. I'm only a week in, but I feel like this app is actually making a difference. They lay out the plan, and I just have to take one emenetly achievable step at a time. Definitely recomend."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not customisable App... So i didn't like it. Although, i do like the concept."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app hits the key parts of making good habits that is hard for me to do. I have severe ADHD; so, even tho I was taught by my grandma how to make a good habit, I still struggle to follow thru on steps 3 & 4. {Making a Good Habit: 1. Make it obvious 2. Make it attractive 3. Make it easy 4. Make it satisfying (reinforce) 5. Habit stacking (repeat 1-4) 6. Habit tracking & Habit buddy} This app has elements that support all 6 steps. I don't even have the subscription. Kudos to the developers!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good motivation. You have to be committed to change. If so, it's a good motivator with tons of options for social support"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Less than a week andI already feel the improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DON'T ENTER YOUR CARD DETAILS They will charge your sooner than one month and you cannot ""cancel subscription any time"". Cannot cancel the subscription from the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I tried it. My life is still the same. In fact I am angrier than before thanks to this app. Drink water. OK. Exercise. I am AT Work I can't do that. Exercise. I. Am. At. Work! Exercise!!! They tried so 2 stars but the endless positive nonsense Is making me sick. Might work for Americans but not for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a pay-to-use app now. Why? I was going to use the exercises for my kids this year. The rest of the app is annoying. There's no reason to charge the people who don't subscribe to all the extra nonsense. We only use the exercises. We don't need the routines and letters and pop-ups. They're nothing but a distraction for us."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Does not tell you it's a paid subscription until after 10-15 minutes of loading screens asking for personal info that was only needed to emotionally manipulate people into buying said subscription. I don't care how well the app works, if that's the first impression they're confident about putting out, I can only imagine the rest of the app does similar manipulation for further payments."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very good app. The only things that really spoiles the experience is the constent begging to send a free pass to your friends. Now I am premium and this make me feel like I'm constantly being followed by a salesperson. I don't think I will renew just because of that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping set routines is exactly what I needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app made me feel my life üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I keep trying to upgrade and take advantage of the free month, but it never completes the process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Clunky and money grubbing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Today is 4th day of me using this app and it's quite good. I took a challenge of not using my phone and nowadays I only use phone for this app or another important things(it is determination too thoughüôÑüòÅ). I am finding myself changing because I seriously wanted to improve. So this is up to you but still it is helpful and we'll made as well. So thank you fabulous, I also want to become like you, Wondrous ‚ò∫."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was a great experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a help ,, thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I have cancelled primium subscription still they charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am more active, and do challenges that makes me more suitable and be change of my old style,thanks to fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The science is solid. This app has helped me a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I honestly don't know what you could do better,it's an amazing app and I love using it it's helped me so mutch ( including my trouble remembering to eat) I love this app it's amazing and I definitely recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's so helpful for changing the way you think."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Garbage trying to sell subscription no thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I hate the way they charge for premium, i don't want to try something that's going to change my life with a week free trial. And I also don't want to pay a lot of money right after for the whole year i wanna pay every month, cuz i would rather want to use premium for one month and than see if ill keep paying. Now im never gonna get premium. But it's a great app its awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a really good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"too much ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I need to cancel and can't"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoyed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want 7 days free trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my membership after a two week trial because I did not like the app. I was still charged the full amount for a year AFTER I cancelled my membership. Put in a request for refund but there is no reply. It seems that customer support does not exist at all. Would not recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I changed the rating from 5 to 4 stars because the bubble reminder that displays over other apps caused my entire phone to not function. Iget a message that the app is not optimized for Android. I was able to turn that function off but now it's less useful to me. If that is fixed I'll put the rating back up. Otherwise I really like it. I used to use HomeRoutines on ios but when I switched to android I had to find a new app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me get through the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has had a very positive impact on my day! Every day! Please do not listen to bad reviews. The app is designed for you to make all the decisions. Also, create healthy habits that work for you. It is not a quick fix!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Short but I really appreciate it very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"There's really great and really bad things about the ap. Overall it's it has the potential to be one of the best 'get your life together' aps available. I've haven't seen anything that compares. The user experience needs tweaking and the ap isn't yet compatible with latest phone updates so it causes phone to freeze and usually this happens when I'm in the middle of something important. Extremely frustrating. Not sure how long I will put up with this. It turns something great into a lemon."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it! Great app and it makes me more motivated than ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"As the name says, Fabulous...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me with my anxiety, depression and panic attacks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is good but i don't the free trial anymore because i can't pay when it ends , i there any way to stop it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the inspirational messages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"a little complicated but you'll reap the rewards later"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks for such a wonderful app with wonderful guidance. I started iy using just 4 days before and I can see changes in my behaviour. And I can have long productive sessions along with my other works. I really appreciage this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this! It really encourages me to complete goals and habits. I love the daily devotional stories and that it reads out loud to you. I would DEF recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very DISAPPOINTED!!! YOU AUTO CHARGED ME FOR RENEWAL WHEN IT'S NOT YET MY DUE DATE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did NOT subscribe to this app & apparently had $39.99 taken out of my account yesterday!! I don't even have this app on my phone! So, how can I get refunded if I don't have the app!?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Update 2: I managed to pay for this (again), so why not try it again and after a week, I now remember why I left. If you just want to read philosophical articles about how you get better in life, okay, (and do you have to pay for that??), but the challenges and journeys are SO CONFUSING to ""get done"" that I just give up and leave, as I am doing again. I just paid for another year and it's money down the drain. I may keep the app, but if I start stressing out over it, it will get deleted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The worst app in term of cancelation. I emailed them, chat with them to cancel my trial way before it's end and they basically just ignored it and take my money! If I can give 0 I give 0"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most remarkable app to keep you motivated on having a healthy routine. Truly amazing app, i highly recommend it to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"lots of great content - i feel like i'm in the right place to support my growth!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yuhhh it's awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Muito bom, n√£o vejo problemas nele at√© agora."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. Like anything it takes a little getting used to, but my life really has become much more structured and my mental health is so much more stable down to this plus a lot of meditation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a great app ! Love every part of it !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm merely just beginning, but I feel so inspired and motivated. I'm excited to see what I will become with this app. Highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent app, no way to cancel the subscription. Please help, no way to talk to support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. It helped a lot in forming new habits. I'm using the free version, which I understand has limits, but it's still a great way to start making new habits. I like the concept of having an unfinished story everytime I finish my routine, and that I need to do my routine tomorrow in order to get the other half of the story. This has really helped me a lot in my CBT journey. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome to completely transform your life, one step at a time, and at your own pace, it encourages you to keep moving forward, even in the face of difficult life circumstances that may hinder your progress at times...highly recommened"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Becoming who I want to be."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Like the app, but no instructions on what to do if user misses a day on their journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Going well so far- there's so much included it can b a bit daunting but super excited to launch in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not let them have your credit card details or you will regret it. They took money without authorization and without contacting me. When I tried contacting them I just got an automated response. I had to report them to theYouTube channel that recommended them to get any response. They obviously didn't want to get on the bad side of the channel. The app itself is pretty but fussy and sends way too many notifications. I don't need a long video when I do something the app told me to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive affirmation. Lovely"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"everything is under pay wall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far... Great help as I navigate adult life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very nice but may I know that I just downloaded this app and just entered some answers to the question and my email id would I have to pay for it please tell As fast as possible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was a huge unmotivational bummer to upload and notice it was not a free app. I understand making money from extra content but would be cool to try some features without a pay-trap (""try for free, you'll easily forget to cancel"")"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good Quite well made and tailored"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was not easy at the start but now am so confident and mind free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I realy dont know who can use this...OFCOURSE u need GOOGLE account to do whatever...so 0 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an amazing App which join you and encourage you to complete your duties in an efficient way in order to keep time for yourself as well. A perfect balanceüßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®üçÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"All parts and all things of a fabulous app is a very good but there is no schedule management for and housewife. Best thing of this app is to improve meditation and feel good for whole day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just getting started, but this app works well. No glitches, and it has useful and informative content. I've already built my first habit, which is drinking water every morning when I get up, and it has really made a difference in my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got scammed too ‚òπÔ∏è please read reviews before installing. Very well designed scam, app is super nice and all, and then surprise! You just signed up for infinite payments and charges that can't be officially canceled (thank God for credit card scam protection). They start a premium account automatically upon download and there is no button or other way to cancel the membership. App tells you to visit website, and website does not recognize accounts created in app. Look at all recent reviews..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Rly rly good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had no motiivation. I now am making good realist goals for myself. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App reminds me to Practice Self Care it makes me Feel Good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is horrible for ADHD too many notifications and upgrade suggestions. Very confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üòíüòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is different from most daily planners. It not only has helped so much in keeping my life organized, but mental health and physical health too. It has meditation, buy unlike other apps, some are actually free. great app, has helped soo much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It wont let me cancel. I think its really bad business practice to rsilrosd your customers into paying for a membership they dont want and cant afford."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a perfect app for new habits. I like every process of learning and it's so much fun and beautiful too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've tried a few programs like this one before. I could tell before their free trials were over that they weren't going to work. Fabulous got to the root of my issues from the start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For most of the part I was fine with Fabulous locking a few features behind a paywall, but then I got hit with the fact that there's even a limit for how many habits you can have at once with a free plan and that instantly ruined my experience with the app and made me seek an alternative. Giving it two stars though, because it did help me form new, healthy habits still."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app. Be aware, they will take your money 42,99 EUR for premium without warning. And it not easy to find where to cancel premium. It was last money to me for few days, so now I'm with stupid app and no money. Be not like me.)) Only good thing what you can learn from this app - not to use app, live your live."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is literally the only thing that gets my through my day. I have multiple learning disabilities that make staying in a routine almost impossible. I had tried almost everything. I even created my own custom routine dry erase template, and I couldn't fulfill that need. With this app, I've been able to change the entire game. I'm in control of my entire day. It's a whole new world and I feel accomplished! Thank you so much üôåüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app, starts with small steps so it isn't to overwhelming but I believe it's slowly starting to help me become a better version of myself, mentally and physically. Thank you fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app easy to use. Excited for new habits and the journey is illustrated and developed in a way that is engaging And motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is a 7 day free trial pay wall to see the app, and when I downloaded it and did the free trial, I quickly realized this app was not for me. Too many notifications, very overwhelming, and it functions by your phone telling you everything you need to do at all hours of the day. (Seems antithetical to mindfulness to me.) They do not send an email about ending your trial and I forgot to cancel and they charged me a non-refundable years worth of the app. Waste of over $40, don't wasteyour money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is just something that will make you someone fabulous who you're proud of him ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåºüêù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged my account even without an active subscription, now taking me in circles when I asked for a refund. It's been over 2 weeks since I asked them to refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using the app a couple of weeks, and I love it. It has such a gentle way of adding good habits. It's very motivating. I keep telling friends about it. I definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very cool features"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It changed my life to the better, plus it has some very entertaining little stories every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing App! Currently on my 8th day streak with my morning routine, just started a night routine. Before fabulous I was a chronic addict of nicotine. I decided to change my perspective and initiate the change needed to grow. This app has made that process 100x easier, highly recommended!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After trying to unsubscribe from the app .I was unsuccessful and have now been charged 55 dollars I don't have ..this isn't cool .o signed up for a one week trail and again was clear that I didn't want to renew this and asked to be taken off .but nope charged me any how . Not happy at all!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hi man! I am finding trouble using your application, it's not operating well enough, it asked me for my email-id but the continue button is not working and bcz of that I unable to use your application... I can even send you the screenshot of it! Hope you could do sth about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel. I cancelled over a year ago (and received confirmation) and they're still trying to charge me to this day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just another quick cash grab app, meh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. Gently motivates & encourages you to be your best.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a blessing I think"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the daily stories of motivation&focus. When I listen I close my eyes & breathe in that moment of listening. Like music to my ears."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Thank you keep up the good work ü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Please listen to your users' experiences! It is not suited for people w/unconventional or odd shift hours/changing timeframes. The user interface needs to be more easily navigateable. Cx's need to be able to go back and edit their past tasks etc. You should be able to clear or ignore the notification without it affecting your ability to respond to a text, or finish emails, etc. We should be able to edit the amount of notifications for each task and edit their times (odd hours included)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good but the subscription is not cheapüôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just so amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very engaging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing and worth it üëå ‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's such a challenge to make a routine. I love the motivation it keeps me coming back. No judgment, no bullying reminders. It helps me think about my day, improve it, enjoy it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow it's a great app now I can set my routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Initial questionnaire does not show the questions, only the answers/options"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want it to work, it will"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app to inculcate good behaviour."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm actually reinforcing healthy habits thanks to this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really interesting app it has got me going and doing stuff that I wouldn't do by myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I agreed to the free trial period to explore the app before investing full steam. When I realized there was a pending expense I tried to Disable and Deregister. Even uninstalled, since there were no subscriptions logged in Play. But a few days later my PayPal was debited- leading to bank account debit. Now I can't get my meds for my MS. I logged my query on their site and emailed, and waiting for a reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesnt say you need to pay money at start, but you have to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money being deducted even without subscribing. Fabulous deducted 39.99 USD without any notification and subscription request. Pls refund the amount immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its just lists you could easily make yourself, with a bunch of BS quotes and pics you can get on Instagram for free. Also gameification tactics which just waste your time and annoy. As someone interested in behavioural change via design etc I'm very disappointed. Definitely not for anyone who doesn't feel inspired by a pic of a beach with 'you can Do it' scrawled in caps over it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DISHONESTY BUSINESS PRACTICES: STAY AWAY! Went to sign up and got an error. Then I could never login because of an app error and I can't reset the password since it says I must use Google OAuth but their app doesn't let me use. Tried multiple ways and even contacted support twice and never responded. Now I find out they have been charging my account the whole time despite it never actually showing me the trial started. I have no way to cancel and am still being charged. Support is non-existent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I like the app.I feel like I have a pal or a buddy who is helping me stay on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Have been struggling for over 12 months to get myself back into a routine and am really enjoying the way Fabulous is slowly getting me back into a routine! Am loving the daily coaching and being able to discover other ways and other people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Neat app but it charged me way before it said it would. Not cool. Dropped stars for that shady move."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"me gusta la aplicaci√≥n, me hace recordar mis h√°bitos o los h√°bitos que quiero implementar en mi vida, da algunos mensajes de motivaci√≥n como ""excelente sigue as√≠"", me gustar√≠a que dejara poner m√°s de 4 h√°bitos pero de ah√≠ todo bien :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Quick simple and helpful make the whole process easier"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app make my life more better and i am feeling great after using this wonderful application üíñ love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I mean in just over a week I'm drinking water daily and have dropped the extra coffee and redbull and feel great. I've re assesed my goals new and past and I'm looking forward to the next 9 months just to see where I am next year . It's a great app and I've barely explored it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the whole concept. There should be like an emergency button or something when it blocks your phone. My days aren't all exactly the same so today I had a zoom meeting and couldn't access to it from my phone and had to restart it. But love the fact that it basically makes you stop what you're doing to commit or block distractions. I've used it for 5 days, so far I really enjoy it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Comprei o premium. Vale cada centavo! Eu amo esse app. Mesmo muitas vezes n√£o conseguindo ter consist√™ncia nas cria√ß√µes dos meus h√°bitos"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like a lot of their approaches to adding small habits but some of the motivational stuff feels crazy fake deep. Also they're obsessed with making people eat breakfast. It is not the most important meal of the day, your first meal is, and some people just aren't hungry in the morning so they shouldn't push themselves to eat. That's the dumbest part."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app! So far I'm happy with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app no ads or anything love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm loving the app. Now that I figured out how to add routines and edit which day of the week certain routines are I'm very excited to get more on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I want to thank fabulous cause you change my life so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing and motivatining"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware of even having this on your device! It was on my phone- I don't even recall downloading it- and they STOLE $62.00 from me! I didn't even start a trial- it isn't listed on my subscriptions & I'm very careful about free trials- I never use them- They somehow just took my money! I'm disputing the transaction as I did not subscribe to it -so be very careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its actually just what I needed to refocus my chaotic art brain"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Mindfull app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've stopped using this app as of now but I want to thank the ever living heck out of this app for giving the tools to start my journey. Thank you for saving my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lame"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been absolutely wonderful and fantastic to have the aid of this app to help day day happiness üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is extremely bad for people with ADHD even though it had be recommended to me on ADHD channel. Why? WAY TOO MANY NOTIFICATIONS!! And a lot of BS messages that don't feel meaningful or useful at all, just like fillers of ""I'm trying to sound like a bad self-help book"". If you have ADHD, stay away from it as it will make everything worse as your phone will always be set in ""don't disturb"" and you will be filled with anxiety and prevented from checking out the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really aggressive scammy app the way it forces you to subscribe. Can't 'not do' silly challenges. After using a while still hard to figure out its value proposition. Reviews probably bought from a bot farm. Regret giving them my info"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Paid App. Works free for a week and then it's paid subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's is a very motivational app and it encouraged me to change myself for the better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like using this app and it has helped me develop some great habits. The only reason I did not sign up for the premium account is because I don't want to pay yearly. If the option to pay monthly is given, I will happily join premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a wonderful resource! Its helping me find time to do the things I've wanted to do for a while, like journaling and drinking a glass of water every morning, etc. Invaluable!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stay away! They secretly charge you and don't respond to any emails. Scammers!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to start putting new habits and goals in affect."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been huge help in motivating me to change my daily habits and building myself up to become the kind of person I ultimately want to be. That person is no longer somebody else or a dream, that person is me and this is reality now. TLDR If you're deciding whether or not you should get this app and if it's worth the your time and space on your phone, just do it. What have you really got to lose by doing this? :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You guys are awesome!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've just started using the app, and I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not of any use without buying subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great all round tool that helps me stay motivated and centered"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its great! - but it has it quirks. It would be better if you could have semi daily goals aswell (eg. 3days a week for gym) instead of solely daily goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its a bit different to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how it's helping build routines!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im really enjoying the app so far, its inspiring me to take control of my life through habit change, slowly, replacing habits peice by piece, hopefully the pace will help me stick to the routines more consistently, rather than getting overwhelmed. The app itself is very well done, i think some people have had issue with the pricing, but i think the benefit is outweighing the cost so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"free trial then charged. It's also incredibly overwhelming. Loads of information with not a lot of direction. There is a bit of a balls ache cancellation process that I find a little old school mitchel brothers! (always puts me off a little) Why can't you cancel from the app or app store? I know I sound like 47 year old Karen but It should be as easy to cancel as it is to join right? Anywhooo... Great potential. Love the idea of headspace vibes having a baby with bullet journal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good for remembering to simplify your life. Living in gratitude reminding is so helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total Chaos. I have been wrongly charged for a service which I never use. When I try to cancel the damn subscription, none of their options work. If i am charged again I'll issue a televised lawsuit against whoever is behind this app. They are just about your $39.99"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it very helpful!! Ty!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After a week this app will bill your Google Play account $39.99 if you don't cancel. I had installed this app on a previous phone and forgot about it, only to find I have been charged twice for an app I never used."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Increased my productivity as well as my confidence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I didn't bought any premium subscription but still I am charged an amount of Rs. 3193.6($39.99) from my credit card . Moreover , despite of the payment I didn't get any subscription. I mailed regarding this to your support on Aug 3 rd but still no reply from your side .

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for better lifestyle changes. Amazing story telling animation and groups community. I loved this app. Nice reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving this experience so far they have great advice, great daily habits that are really great when put into a challenge, and there are loads of them that I love!! It helps me stay on track, and provides great information for those who are after a FREE experience üí™"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't believe the day light robbery they are doing even when I've not started using the app. They show 'get fabulous premium membership 3.33 INR/month billed every 12 months' and 'join free for a week' But doesn't allow to join for free unless I choose a plan which would be billed after a free week at $39.99 billed every 3 months. I wish there was a scope of uploading a pic, would've put screenshots of the same. Would never join, also ensure my friends n family don't too. Good luck!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Terrible customer service it won't allow you to talk to a real person, you get an online bot. Then the bot doesn't understand you so they submit a ""request"" in which it'll take 7-10 days just for human to contact me?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible I tried the 7 day trial, the alarms in the app didn't work, it was just bad all around tried canceling my subscription 4 days before trial ended no way to cancel they tell you go to website and can't do anything from website either customer support says it will take 10 days to respond to message to try to cancel so they charged me for the premium subscription I didn't want I will be disputing this with my bank they are just trying to rob you don't even do the trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, I would like it to have the option to restart journeys/goals because life happens, especially when you have 3 year old twins. Sometimes I just don't have a chance to do what I'm supposed to do for the journey a day or two at a time. But other than that, it's pretty good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app, scummy payment system. I registered a premium account yesterday for the free 7 day free trial and got an email for a code to get a 30 day free trial. When I redeemed the code it said I didn't have an account so I logged in with Google account that was linked and then when I checked my subscription status it showed I had two subscriptions to the same thing, which potentially would've cost me double if I hadn't noticed. It's bad enough you have to check on the website. Scummy practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HELP! I tried to cancel after my free trial ended and wouldn't let me. Charged me $40 that I don't have to spend on an app. You can see I've never used it. Please!!! Cancel and refund me!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Manipulative membership practices. Should be illegal. Great app, but not worth the money. Cancelling requires desktop mode on their website and then you need to click on a needless menu. The button isn't hidden, but it is subtle. Then they ask if your sure. Then they ask again if you're sure, readvwrtise their product, and basically hide the button to continue to cancel. Then they ask all over again. No thanks. This kind of membership practice should be illegal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I need more time to fully take in everything that this app offer's or it would have a 5"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash app. Doesn't let you know whilst signing up that they're forcing you to the premium service then make it super difficult to cancel your subscription before the trail ends making you pay ¬£30+ for 3 months. If you search on Google for this app one of the top suggestions is ""cancel subscription"" and I see why. Will never recommend this to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really fabulous"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will not talk to you if you want a refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too damn expensive they should tell you that they want 50 bucks yearly prior to downloading the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm new to fabulous. So far I really enjoy the stories it tells, and the inspirational narratives it gives you. I am glad I bought the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been on my journey now for 36 years and I've tried many things but on this fabulous journey only a week and I will tell you I have found my fabulous path and for the first time I can see and feel the change and love for myself growing. I can't tell you how many times I passed up this app thinking it wouldn't be the one for me but now I can say please love yourself enough to give it a go. You can do it. You just have to start. Now. Love you."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Haven't been able to use this app because as soon as the Q/A session ends, the app just blacks out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's a great app, but I have been tricked into buying it. I took the 7 days free to check how it is and the next thing I know is that I payed 40‚Ç¨ for the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App utilissima"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"phenomenal"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it actually is fun to use and in turn it makes it easier to actually learn these new habits you are trying to make for yourself. The free version is just fine for anyone just starting out but I find if you pay for it that it is so much more fun and interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"(Update) Today it charched 79.99 after charging 39.99 just a week ago. No respond at all from customer service at all. My card company unauthorized the transaction and started investigation. I don't know what happened to this app company and why it started to scam. /Be careful. It can be scam when you have an issue. I was charged during the free trial like others complained here. I sent a request for refund but no one responded and hard to contact them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app so far, it's sad that you have to pay when not having a credit card for more features tho. Still it does everything it says. So 5 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a fabulous life saver."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely and bright graphics. Nice, friendly, gentle reminders of good lifestyle habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Could not find an account setting on the sites in order to cancel any subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far the app is very good. it helps me keep my mental health in check. I can highly recommend the app."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is amazing so far, I feel so grateful that I found it, and I haven't tried yet the paid version! Can't wait to explore it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've used a lot of habit tracking apps and this is the first one that actually got me to stick with it. Highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is Fabulous! Pun intended lol I love this app for helping me create, keep track & maintain daily healthy life habits. AND they have many to choose from or create your own to customize just what YOU need in your daily life to accomplish what you desire!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't unsubscribe. Says you can unsubscribe on their webpage, but the tab you're meant to access doesn't exist"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has really improved my mood and drive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is something to depend on .....a guide and a companion on ur journey to success. The only issue I have is in getting the premium membership as it always tells internal server error and doesn't subscribes me. Please look into it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience. Customer Service non existent, the app is buggy and I cannot contact them through it. Had to use the website and still after 4 messages no answer. I cancelled my trial and I was still charged. For an app that is buggy and has no customer service whatsoever. I want my money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"BEST"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to stay on track if you stay consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I recently started using this and have found it really good for setting better daily habits, especially since mine were terrible beforehand."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*BUYER BEWARE* Need to cancel subscription if you want to trial. There is no obvious way to cancel and when you do, they charge you anyway and in my case TWICE. Not worth ¬£35 let alone ¬£70. The only way you may contact complaints team is via an online form to and they stone wall you. *EDIT* My bank reversed charges immediately, anyone caught by this, go to your bank within 120 days of payment. *EDIT2* Flag as inappropriate in Google apps - this company needs to loose it's editors recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's quite good and fun actually"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It isn't free, let's you set everything up then informs you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is just what I needed. Can't wait to explore more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the experience and it actually is easy to navigate"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is my second time installing this app because im a doofis. I am in great need of something to hold my hand and guide me to do better with myself. Im so glad this app exists"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Greedy and exploitative of desperation. I feel SO MUCH WORSE about myself after getting sucked into premium and still getting nowhere. Looking at the tasks and not finishing them just wrecked my self esteem over the last 2 months. I need to just forget I ever got this app and just be happy with who I am. I hope I can forget I ever saw this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a app, which would contain both scheduling features and also would look after my mental health and this is one of the best apps i have found so far. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible service levels downloaded application and deleted. Offered 3 month trial but have had two attempts to take money from my card. When contacting them they say 10 days wait for a response. Terrible service and reason enough to have nothing to do with this company. That service level with an application designed to entice money from its users tells you all you need to know about these money grabbers. Please delete my card details from your systems immediately - third request!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought I would try it but you absolutely have to give it only your payment details but they take your finger print as well. BEWARE! I uninstalled immediately."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hearing from my future self was very motivational for me. Also as someone neurodiverse the reminders, interactive checklists, and stories keep me engaged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent motivator!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It helps me build better habits and stick with a routine! I recommend it to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfeito!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for motivation and behavioral direction."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulously effective!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional, would recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great effort. I find it unnerving to have only white male/female voices included in this app. If you really want to create a non judgmental environment as your app suggests, then you may want to include a non binary option as well as voices from a range of cultural backgrounds. Even if your main target group is just the US at the very least include voices that reflect the Latino and Black wisdom you can draw on. üñêÔ∏èüñêüèΩüñêüèø"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The idea is awesome but it bothers me that the app keeps asking for a review (even after writing one) and to share it with friends. Distracting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disappointing After about 45 minutes of filling out my profile and everything, turns out they want a credit card. It's not cheap either. Don't waste your time with this app. It's very misleading and disappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app but nobody responds to requests for support..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is amazing!! It is really helping me make some better choices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THE FREE TRAIL- THEY CHARGE! I reached out to the business on their Instagram because they charged me on the last day of my FREE TRIAL. 7 DAY FREE TRIAL. I canceled on the last day due to the app being way too much for me. Poorly executed and confusing for someone who wants something user friendly. THEY CHARGED ME. I was told by someone on their Instagram I can get a refund, so I emailed the proof of charge & they said I was supposed to cancel 24 hours before the last day. What?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good but story narrator sounds a little like kaiser Permanente ads"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Changed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome... All in one self help guide... Kudos to the makers üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even the free program is worthwhile to start and a credit card is not required."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the app. It is pleasant to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped a lot in changing my habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Has done a great job helping me to make better life choices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is great but I don't understand why you can't skip/fast forward some exercises. Only the basic ones have a skip button. If you're in the middle of a workout and the app crashes, you're forced to start from the very beginning and wait. It's a very basic feature that is simply missing. It makes the user experience very frustrating sometimes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't remember signing up for app, was charged $40 and requested a refund within minutes of getting notification from bank. Didn't even have this app downloaded to my phone. Refused refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam regarding subscriptions. Total cash grab. I paid twice because I was given a ""personalised coaching set up"" which I had no idea would cost $67 to answer some questions. When I asked for my money back they said they had to spend time and effort for the personalised coaching which is a joke as it's all automated. I'm sure they billed me earlier than the agreed trial too. The help centre got back to me eventually saying they cannot refund me because it's in the contract. Regret using this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app I enjoy it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It looked very pretty and I'm sure that some people will find it beneficial but as a shift worker the last thing I need is something else that tells me to ""wake up at the same time everyday"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been a week and it's fantastic. Makes it easy for you and reminders actually work. Helps to build positve habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really good for tracking your morning routine and and many more things it is actually helping my day routine to be back on track again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app, wonderful motivation and story."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Pretty pointless. Just becomes an another annoying notification app. I am not compelled to open it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a functional way to help keep me on track with starting better routines and healthier choices. Its simple and easy to use. I enjoy it a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My subscription was canceled, and ended in April but I was charged in July for the renewal? More than 10 days and no response, email, or refund. Don't pay for this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what I've been looking for to help me create better habits and a more stable daily routine. It's so motivational and I love all the graphics, stories and encouragement. I can't recommend this app enough."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome qp so far. I'm loving it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subscription based app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a good app to change your life üß¨"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is my favorite wellness app because it lets me choose different categories of well being to focus on. I can choose practicing something, healthier food choices or short exercise breaks. The Fabulous app is like having a friend with good habits to help me. I like the science based approach too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's keeping me on track better than I have been and it's actually making my mindset much more calm and not so overwhelmed. I appreciate you guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would literally give it a one star cause...like i was feeding all my opinions and after that the app said some motivation and in the last step it was paid....for real i wasn't expecting that..... I recommend don't download the app‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I was subscribed but did not renew to save money. I kept the app because i liked the positivity and ability to be mindful. But now I am going to uninstall because app has become inconvenient and obnoxious. Music comes on during the most inconvenient times: in a meeting, watching a movie, talking to an associate... And am unable to turn off! I have to silence my phone and then end up missing notifications. Sorry but do not want bullies on my phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You can push yourself to do any habit/routine but most times you forget and end up failing. This app has helped me tremendously in keeping up with my new, healthy routines and helps me find myself a lot of the times I'm lost. Recommending to everyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I did Noom for 2 years - but I have Adhd. I kept searching for ""Noom for adhd"". This is exactly what I was looking for!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I used to absolutely love this app! It's beautiful, works well, and really inspired me to open it up in the morning and stick with my routine. However, the free version is now totally non functional. You can only add 4 habits per routine and ads for premium pop up during your routine which kind of ruins the point. I redownloaded it recently to see if things had changed, but unfortunately this is still essentially paid-only."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is incredible - it was recommended to me by a friend. Alot of time and effort went into this app and it's hard not to see and appreciate it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just getting started so I can't give 5 stars. But so far this app is really helping me get back into good habits I fell out of."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, it's great! No complaints. I had a light exercise, took a shower, and worked on some of my laundry. Keep in mind, I'm almost 15, and not many 15 year olds would do any of the chores that I've done, let alone exercise. Wunderbar!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Need Refund Now Please. I don't know why I was charged when I have already canceled my account- months ago. I had to re-download the app to see if I could contact help and gave up trying to find it. Please refund my money. This app does not work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far i like the lay put. I only wish I could add my own custom routines to my day more easily"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have only been at this for a week, it seems okay, but I will keep an open mind and see how it goes in a few months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great! I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for the free trial. Tried to cancel it on the last day of the trial but it had already charged my card. I don't find any of the features helpful (I am ADHD inattentive type). Really disappointed that I was forced to pay for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great concept but too repetitive which makes me just tune out all the notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I've been very impressed with the software, the graphics, the research & the ease of use of Fabulous. Only on my 2nd day but loving it so far & had to get the premium !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app so far. Made with a lot of thought."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"That one star rating is for the annoying sounds during setup, as well as for the non skipable idle times until these useless animations come to an end. Seriously, I was super close to just remove this app untested because of that. Might update this rating after getting it up, silent and running."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like the app. It helps me to feel better about myself by setting up small goals. Big things starts with small steps. üíô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Time spent on this app should be spent reading and exercising. Slow and wasteful implementation of common psychological tricks. Read a book on good habbits... use your daily calendar..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app for building good habits and routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the stories and soothing reminders. A chore turns to habit turns to life"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want to create long lasting things start here, everyday I wake up to a glass of water, eat a big breakfast and excercise And I'm only at the start!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is straight garbage and a money grab. They make it impossible to find and cancel your subscription, and even if you do, they will still charge you. Don't fall for the ""free premium trial"" nonsense. Horrible customer service, there are no live people to talk to, you will be referred to a bot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are running a scam for trial version. They will charge you before the period ends and then will not refund the money. Don't sign up for the trial if you just want to try the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, makes building habits fun and has lot's if great methods. Many of the ideas you get in Fabulous are the same ones I learned from expensive business coaches (which are worth the price too if you're in the right industry) I'd highly recommend Fabulous for getting started with accountability and self improvement and turning it into a full time habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful App. Great motivational resources all in one place. Simple and fun way to build and maintain new habits. I've been using it for 6 days and so far I am more calm on a daily basis, alcohol free for 5 days, down 3 pounds and finding it easier to break away from old toxic crutches."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to unsubscribe! It is impossible to cancel the subscription via the app. The only way is to sign in via the internet browser. It doesn't make any sense to subscribe easily in one place and to unsubscribe on a different platform."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A practical and thoughtful app that has helped me immensely in getting back to a beneficial routine after years of upheaval."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic program for mental health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app more and more each day! Yay, Go Team Sarah!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Use full"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"it's an amazing app, but not free in everything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very helpful in implementing new habits and very user friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great virtual life coach"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps with RECOVERY! New healthy good habits! Baby steps work if u take them.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great guidance and motivation for making positive changes in your life in small steps. Working on making lifestyle habits instead of temporary change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Speachless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a very good app to use tbh but the thing is that u have to pay and join the premium to get the best experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deceiving. The free trial must be cancelled on the app website and not through your google subscriptions. When I asked for a refund as I was mistaken and had looked in google apps to cancel, I was told it was in their agreement and too bad, so sad. Not impressed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried out premium for free then cancelled because I wasn't using it. They proceeded to charge me $39.99 out of the blue, you also can't cancel subscription on the app you have to do it on the web."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so amazing it helps alot and I finally got my life back I love it please get the app and you will love itüëÅüëÅ üëÖ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE! I am continually being charged for this even after cancelling. I'm taking $39 every fortnight. It's ridiculous & unethical. I've emailed support multiple times with no response. Extremely dissatisfied. The app itself is extremely cluttered & confusing to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Cant sign that contract at the start but looks neat just dont feel comfortable making oaths"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Couldn't try it, it still wants me to subscribe. I would be happy to pay for that if it's good, but first I want to try it, not first subscribe. I know I can cancel it, but I don't know how and don't want to try it and loose so much money. I would be willing pay monthly subscription, but yearly it's lot of money at once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy to follow steps and lots of positive encouragement to help you along your journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"After just 3 days it starts to help me so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Is not an option to cancel the free trial therefore I will need to cancel my debit card to stop the payment. App wasn't great nor the service"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought the app would let me choose more of habits I want to build myself but it just puts habits on you, kinda disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for new journeys recommend to family members"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You get the free 3 day trial and then after that, the app just wont show on your subscriptions, youll then think it's all good, and then bam youll just be shocked to see a charge on your card. Amazing. You cant ask for a refund from Google Play because again, it does not show on your subscriptions. So please, do yourselves a favor and do not even try the free 3 day trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazingly perfect app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very very nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hoping I don't get billed for this just installed it and after giving my address found out it's a monthly subscription. Not good guys!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was ready to remove distractions and found I had time for more. I needed new habits to take control of the chaos. This app is guiding me through completing small goals towards bigger successes in forming motivating habits. This app has added to the peace I needed. Thanks creators!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app of its kind I would suggest it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You have to invest time to understand how the app works but its 100% worth it. The app helps you build habits you choose. You can create morning, daily and nightly routines, you can start journeys which help you with for example mental training or addiction management. The option i enjoy most is the 8 minute coachings. I got way more productive by battling procrastination. I am getting fitter physically and mentally and i learned how to manage my time effectively. I also stopped smoking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb app...made my day !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I really like that they started you off by giving you small challenges to Jumpstart a habit, gradually increasing activities that make up a routine. it feels like getting your life organized is actually within reach."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a beautifully designed app thats helped me get my old habits back on track. My only complaints are (1) you can't have more than 4 goals in the free version. Thats not super helpful, so unless I get a lot out of this app, I'll be canceling my free trial soon. And (2) I can't keep my times tasks going unless my phone screen is on and actively on the app. So if I'm having breakfast and want to respond to a text, I can't continue the task timer. Other than that its a nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't have time to do any routines because it won't shut up. 1st thing listed on my bedtime routine is ""unplug"", then ""tidy"" and ""read"". Second I hit unplug, it starts reminding me to tidy and read. ""Ding, ding, ding. Haven't read yet? Here's a full color reminder with a 4 minute video telling you why you should!! Need help tidying? Choose from these 9 options! Don't forget you can stop smoking w/us too!"" Y'day, it sent 3 emails, 3 coaching sessions and dinged ""reminders"" 22 times."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"3rd day of using this app and I think it's very effective. I feel productive each day. I really appreciate it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just starting, but it seem easy to help build good habits. It's something there to help keep you accountable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app that makes my habits that are negativity affecting me go away for habits that are good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had a free trial that wasn't supposed to renew or be charged until October. Not only was I charged, but I was charged twice. This put my bank account in the negative and now I can't pay my bills. Thanks. If I could but zero or negative stars, I would. Don't bother with this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life, 5/5"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soulful !! The coaching is by far my favorite component but the overall mission of changemaking thru small realistic habits everyday has been compelling and transformative. Taking vitamins and drinking water every morning is now as much a part of me as making my bed and brushing my teeth. The science behind it is honest and the multitude of resources leaves much to be explored. Night coaching makes me excited for bed !! Thank You, Fabulous ‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really really really useful and it's features are so good,and i loved the sound systems.. enjoy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just try itüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only been on my journey with fabulous for 3 days now. And I'm already forming good habits. Slowly but surely in small baby steps. I would recommend this to anybody. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression. This app has helped with both already. I'm very excited to continue this journey after the first 30 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes me think"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"To get up early Get some time to study some books"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just loved it.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Extremely calming and it works soooooo well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is the best it has helped me get thru my day many many times i think that everyone should have this app it encourages you to get up and do the simplest things it really helps although it seems easy its those little things that help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app because even if you are not on premium there is no annoying ads moreso I feel like this app is a person guiding me throughout my journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I have subscribed the app and now after few days deciding unsubscribe bcz its just not my cup of tea..it beautiful app,but can not unsubscribe with any trying so its make me frustrating....look like Im traped now. Please support team unsubscribe me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"If you don't pay for the upgrade, it isn't all that much. It's quite useless without the upgrade"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The life changing process starts off slow but that's ok. You also have to pay if you want to do any other journey than fabulous night and an unexpected journey and the side stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the motivation to stay hydrated, take my medicine in a timely manner and other good habits to live a long happy life. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very fabulous i have one request for you keep make it free or reduced the cost"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good for a lazy man like me ,its inspiring me to do something instead of just lay on my bed..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a really good app, helps you a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged during free trial. Avoid! Edited to add: doesn't show in Google play subscriptions and very hard to cancel or even find a link to get a refund as unable to do so on website or through app/googleplay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Same as other reviews out there. Great potential, the app comes with pretty animations and colours but as soon as you start using it it gets way too rigid and the pop ups and videos get very annoying. It also feels like the app is collecting as much data about you as possible and I didn't feel 100% reassured about what they are doing with it. It felt a bit like a marketing survey at some points."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app will truely change your life but some others don't remember dont judge it by the cover I have learnt tens of this but for your own curiousity you have to download and find out for yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This really does help motivate you to finish things. I personally see the timer ticking down and so i have to finish that! I really love this i just wish there was a way to set goals for specific days like a calender mode."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You get po√≠nts for finishing challenges and then use the points to get some in-game rewards."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really a great app, Helps keep you motivated and on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeping up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely worth your time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Interesting app, felt scammed in the end. The app looks cool an interesting and even seemed to be working in some ways as I started. However the trial wasn't long enough to really test it, and instead of leading into a 1-month subscription, it defaulted into a non-refundable 1-year subscription. No worries, these things happen. I ask support to change to a 1 month or to refund my 1-year subscription, but they refuse. All sales final, even when our app helps trick you into sub-ing for a year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a fabulous! App this is my third time around and I don't feel like a failure I absolutely love love love love the app it makes me feel like I've accomplished something positive in my day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sneaky.. signed up for the free trial, and like many others I could not find how to cancel it through the play store or through the app itself. Turns out you can only do it through their website - which I didn't even know existed. Just been billed $60 for an annual fee for an app I've never used. So shady"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Huge waste of time just to be forced to a goal that you probably already do. Navigation is a nightmare and almost everything is behind a paywall. How are you supposed to decide if it's worth paying for if you can't even see what it is?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good: The app works really well for me. The habits are scaffolded and the streak system is dynamic and interesting enough for me to actually want to keep growing. In fact, the morning routine has become my daily staple now. Bad: However, I notice that lately, whenever the notifications came up, my phone keyboard will become non-functional. Sometimes, the alarm would not stop ringing even after I have completed the tasks. It has gotten so bad that I have to delete the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the progressive nature.of the changes I am implementing with the help of this application. Well worth the Premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"amazing app literally changed my lifestyle and made it more tidy would recommend it's very easy to use and doesnt have alot of instructions because it is very clear"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Lots of fancy marketing spiel. Really not worth the annual subscription amount they lure you into paying for. Uninstalled, cancelled subscription and not even using what was paid for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Signed up for a free trial, canceled it before the free trial ended, and still got charged over $50. Not happy. I don't even use this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful and makes my days on this planet just so much brighter and fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing like taking advantage of people to buy a subscription to actually be able to use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Their payment system is fraud! Be careful! Never give any information!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's different but nice. I enjoy it a lot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Poor execution. I installed the app and signed up for the premium upgrade with a 30 day free trial. Upon signing up for premium and setting up an account, I was unable to actually log in to the app. I would enter my email and password and would receive a login failed notice. Very disappointing, considering I felt that this would be a helpful app to use to change habits. Only saving grace was being able to cancel the premium upgrade."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not magic well how about the first thing that hits you is vodo music and demonic imagery. No thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üòÉüòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It greatüòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using it for a few days but it's very intuitive and builds slowly so that I don't rush ahead and burn myself out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a very deep app. Its all about the journey into one's self. Plus your interaction with others. There is alot of water drinking, which IS really good for you! Overall its about becoming a better person , being mindful of each other & trying to make it a habit! There are many topics to choose from , if you have a particular area you'd like to work on. There is also plenty of room for journalling. All this and more. so you can bring forth the best possible version of yourself & it Works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really amazing they gave us free trial for everything like we have 1 video to medidate and then other like exercise to weight loss eventually.... This app is awesome definitely use it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"be careful, unsubscribing is done in a scummy way where you need to go on their page on the website, can't do it on the phone and they make it as hard and misleading as possible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It may be helpful for people to know that The Fabulous, in making cancelling their service practically impossible, they continue to reap monthly payments until you're able to figure out EXACTLY HOW to shut them down. They were meant to cancel my subscription as of 5/20/22 but continue to draw monthly fees as I continue to search for the ""magic combination"" to stop the madness! Best not to become involved with this disingenuous company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous App has helped me to boost self-confidence and improved my daily self-care routine. The App is very thoughtfully put together and is helpful for you to go easy on yourself for Mental WELLNESS and then with time you can increase your skill-set and items in your routine. You also have the opportunity to change your routines. It's a Wonderful Tool. Thank you to the creators for all of the inspiration and motivation provided herein."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still getting used to it, learning to pay attention to it's reminders, but it seems to be legit. I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The promo period is a SCAM. Huge barriers to cancellation to get $. The app doesn't even let you set up the routines until after it charges you. I was charged without any warning during a promo period. Can't manage your subscription in-app -- says to go to the website but doesn't give the address then the website says can't open due to cookie policy. Aside from that, app is too flashy and overly complicated. SCAM complete SCAM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I'm having a good time on this app but what fabulous could use is having some widgets for my home screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"If you give free service then it will much better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so amazing!I don't think 'amazing' is it, it fabulous!!!I love my self more now,I'm not stressed out or become out of control anymore!I love it so much!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using the app for a couple of days so far. But I've been impressed with the quality information and the look and feel of the app so far. Only did 5 stars since I haven't been using it long. May change to 5 stars at the end of the month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life Changer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Impressive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying the app so far! I love the Fabulous insight and motivation section. Has some interesting reads and good insight. I like how the app reminds you not to do too much at one time and to reward yourself. If anything, I would pay the $3 per month just to read the articles! They are short and sweet and very beneficial to me. I only give 4 stars bc I am day 4 and havent been doing the app long enough to give 5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam. I activated a week trial and then got an email from them offering a one month trial, so I clicked the link and went for it. They charged me $40 after 1 week! I emailed their support over a week ago explaining this and asking for a refund and have received no response. Went to go into my subscriptions to cancel and it's not listed in there. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! On top of that's it's way too busy and not very intuitive. Going to be calling my credit card company on these guys."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is better than I thought , EXCELLENT üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had to rate it to get rid of the annoying prompt to rate it. I'll rerate it later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I subscribed for the premium because it says 3.33 Zar a month. That is rands. This is dishonest pricing because when you go furtber you realise its 3.33 dollars. Is this app 3. 33 rands or not? If not, please remove that false advertisement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good a little pricey but worth the cop"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you literally do nothing to prepare for your day now this may be a good app. If you need an app to prompt you to drink water this may be a good app. If you have a problem with the app you will have zero support and trouble unsubscribing. I do not recommend this app to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun, motivating, and very insightful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This really helped me to gat back on track with life . Thank you so much Fabulous for making this app !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Don't like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing self changing exp."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too many unwanted notifications"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app.. But once you've shaped yourself, delete it coz the norifications may annoy.. loved the app btw"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Introduction was great. I felt like the app was genuinely trying to get to know me in order to personalize my experience. Then it asked for payment information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"that app has something to do with praise kink ngl"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will send you numerous ""deals"" and ""bargains"" to confuse you to pay more and more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The amount of time and commitment you'll need to provide to this is almost counter productive to most peoples reasons for downloading it. The notifications are anxiety building in that they are so constant. Please check timings for payment due on after the free trial because time zone comes into affect here and I was charged in the middle of the night where I am so my reminder to cancel the trial was useless."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing application, helps to keep you healthy and focused... I love the fact that the tasks are not too imposing. It's a slow and steady is it's model"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty alright. Slorps are busy folks and this has done a half decent job of curbing procrastination common in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating and inspiring. Users can customise the app to suit their needs and goals. It has helped me feel good about myself and to develop a healthy and happy lifestyle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like how they build the habits one at the time and link them toghether. A lot of people fall into the trap of trying to do to much from the start and get discouraged when they can't keep up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Really frustrating that you can't seem to cancel subscription on Web or in app! Wish I never signed up for this rubbish app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for motivation!! One of the best self coaching app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Email address is required, but so seems the Box check for Motivational email is apparently required, but doesn't state that it is. Easy fix..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sehr gut!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't continue the free-trial I uninstalled the app few minutes I downloaded it does it make charges after 7-weeks ?just inform me so I dont have to get panic when something pop ups out of nowhere."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I feel myself getting better already and it's only been a couple days. The alarms don't work but I guess that's what our phones are for LOL! I love how it gives me little boosts and that I'm able to set challenges at my own pace. I'm currently doing a 7 day journaling challenge. As a teen, my mental health isn't always good and I've been looking for a way to help myself. I've started drinking more water, brushing my teeth better. I very much recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good to start and stick to positive routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Recently purchased the premium plan for this but they say if u want to cancel, you'll find it in your subscriptions area of the Play store. It is not there. So how do I cancel if I want to???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"üëçüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚òÜ‚òÜ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°Fabulously Fabulous‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚òÜ‚òÜ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have no problem with paid apps but its not ok for me to spend my time entering my details to realize at the end that the application is paid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Lovely"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Silently charges you for a 1 year subscription and doesn't show subscription settings in the app. The initial email said there was a '30-day pass' but you will get charged after 2 weeks. Support refuses to issue a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There is no cancelation option for the free trial. They do not reply to your emails at all. So if you subscribe with e.g. paypal they will charge you and will not refund the money. Horrible experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving the app, bit sometimes in a given morning I will get too many notification popping up, which is overwhelming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worked great the first few weeks but then my Samsung did an update and now I get these notifications saying this app isn't optimized for the update and some functions of my phone will not work properly. Then my touch screen quits working and my phone starts glitching so then I have to restart my phone at least once some times a few times tho to get it working normally again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i love it! its such a positive app and gives so much encouragement <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"NICE APP. IT'S HELP TO MAKE SMALL HABITS, AND REMEMBER SMALL HABITS CAN CHANGE FUTURE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app already helped my habits in the first 3 days! Along with helping habits, the ""circles"" (groups) post daily tips with the topic the group is about! 10/10, I would buy premium if I could."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i was charged to a large amount of money even tho i didnt purchase their plan üôÑüòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just an amazing app. The inventor gave all his love in it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great app you do have to pay though it is ¬£35 a year which is pretty good I would definitely recommend it or even just to try out the 30 day trial 100% recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing and life changing. I highly recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THE WORST. Have to PAY for a membership. Literally the worst thing ever. Will not help you from the get go. Makes you go through like 20 random questions and then says ""I know I won't live forever"" in a ""contract""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Far better than other app's but u guys need to buy the primium to enjoy it fully ü•∫ü•≤"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty decent habit builder, although it can be a little too pretentious at times"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't do it!! The app is unnecessarily confusing and the payment system will charge you then never refund you. I was on a free trial from a partner code, an email offered me a free month so I upgraded, then when I hit cancel my card was charged for a year's subscription and now the company refuses to refund me. TERRIBLE customer support, not worth one day of a free trial imo."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Cool and inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app its helped me become a better person!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app so far. I have enjoyed the insights and mindful tips, tools, and motivational quotes. It has been a great experience to date"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app, when you have a hard time holding yourself accountable. It's a nice reminder of how to live your beat life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"cute app and really motivating!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been trying to cancel this app but no luck. Can someone please help me? I looked at another review where the person was asking the same thing, followed instructions given, but could never find contact info. I was just charged another $55 on my credit card. Ive had this app for a year or more. I don't use it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"My experience in the Fabulous app offered me some peaceful time and effort to finish the tasks. Sometimes, I was not willing to check the tasks periodically at some point of the day. However, with every task perfectly and carefully planned in my mind, I was able to construct a simple routine for my morning ritual. Thanks to the amazing animation and design of Fabulous, it was able to encourage me to start a new era of my life as a teenager. Keep it going and good job to the Fabulous creators!‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the voiceover, and the readings as well. I just feel bad that I cannot subscribe despite several attempts. Thanks to whoever created this necessary app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app if you want to better your life?!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good training app for consistent work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I found the app useful at first and bought it for a year. I quit using it within months and deactivated my subscription through the play store. Apparently that doesn't work, you have to contact them in order to get them to cancel your subscription. I still have no idea how to do it and if I get charged another year after emailing and contacting them and telling them I cancelled, I will be reporting fraud charges to my credit card company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app really gives you the hard sell to upgrade to premium before you even get to try the basic version. I did try it out for a few days. It seemed like it was not very customizable. The first week, you are supposed to log in the app every day when you drink water in the morning. The next week (which I didn't get to), you are supposed to log when you eat breakfast. I already eat breakfast and drink water in the morning every day...I don't need help building a habit around this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app that is easy to use and so helpful. It's kept me accountable and on track with small habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why to pay before trying ?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"one step at a time i am moving..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm liking this app a lot. It actually helps more than I thought it would. Who knew starting with small goals that almost anybody can do and then moving up to big ones is actually effective? This app says it's back by scientific studies on behavioral activities and it definitely shows. I would highly recommend this app to anybody that wants to improve their self or their life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice innovative app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun way to keep progressing and/or keep track of ur habits, ^_^ thankyou Fabulous ‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"seems really good. definitely worth giving it a try. basically a life coach. Edit: it's gotten a bit clunky. I wouldn't use it anymore for this reason. Honestly think it's gotten harder to use after the initial beta, it's quite pushy for subscriptions and it's not exactly cheap so I've gone away on it. Previously it was a very good simple morning routine planned. But that'd gone away and now it's got far more features but is harder to use imo. Love the idea, just hope it's polished up a bit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Couldn't stop free trial and cancel before charge on my card. The subscription didn't show up in my Google playstore page. The charge is not refundable. Never happened to me before. It's like dealing with a ghost that took my money!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Used to be amazing, super customisable and helpful, until they added subscription. This made it way less accessible and felt like it was forcing you into someone else's routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"These methods are extremely doable for me and I am now confident of making desired changes in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam, I get billed more than it's written"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Value for money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so good! It helped me every day and it has so much routine to do and even that you can also write your routine for the day! I love it so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good start of you want to start building your habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You will also gonna love this appüñ§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the app and i think it is helping me but it does take some time to learn to navigate it. I dont think i have found all of it yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Interesting app. Very informative"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I appreciate that it holds me accountable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't manage your sub in the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Had this app when it was in beta as a teen and it helped me out a lot but uninstalled for some reason. Now as a grown woman it's already helping me with a great morning (actually afternoon, since I work night shift) start that keeps me going!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been rewarding to wake up and be consistent with my small bite size goals, after all consistency is key!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's fine but I don't like it when you need to pay for a schedule like...what's the point üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's upsetting that I have yet to have someone respond to me about upgrading from the free to a trial period and losing my progress. Imagine moving over from having significant progress and when I log in I'm back at drinking water? I'm hoping someone can help with this because what is the purpose of using the free 30 day premium if I have lost all my progress?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory. Horrible. Non-stop annoying alerts but I don't have time in the middle of my day to watch all these generic videos. I signed up for a free trial, but there's no way to cancel from the app itself. It tells you to go to the website but doesn't tell you what the website is and it doesn't come up easily in a web search. How do I unsubscribe before they start charging me??? EDIT: the website is the fabulous.co if you need to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very functional and straightforward"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Soo good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP! I used to make my own schedules but I never could really kick-start it. Fabulous has really helped me go in routine and my life feels more organized now. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is very polished and gives us structure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app with gamification and great story to track with every day you achieve your better self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app plays a big role in my life and I can't have a productive day without it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great way to gain motivation and beat procrastination if you make the choice to commit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a good app but it's not for me, i just want to cancel before i get charged, any idea on how to do it?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous not only gave me hope, showed me the way, helped me at every step of the way, but it also changed me (or should I say that it is constantly changing me) entirely. I am no longer irritable, groggy, unmindful, procrastinator. This is a new me which feels great at every moment. I had seen my life change, I was able to do what I think was not possible. No words can express my gratitude towards 'Fabulous'. THANK YOU!, THANK YOU FABULOUS! THANK YOU!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had tried habit stacking on my own unsuccessfully but with fabulous I have a daily guide to habit stacking and I'm loving it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is gentle and nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Same issue as described by someone else. Activated a trial and a promo -- was uncertain if it even took. I was charged without any warning during a promo period. Can't manage your subscription in app -- says to go to the website but doesn't give the address. Super sketch, very disappointed that they create confusion with their many offers, put barriers to cancellation, don't apply the promo they offer, and don't warn of trial ending."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spent the $15 to try it out, was not a fan. Deleted app not knowing they would continue me on to a plan that was 55$ without even knowing! A lot of money to be out for nothing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has become my new best friend. Has helped me stay focused, on my day to day routine üòåand has so much more to offer.. just love this application..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"**RED FLAG** THEY DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO REMOVE YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS FROM THEIR SYSTEM and they keep attempting to take payment even if you cancel the free trial. Also their customer support is just an email address which does not respond. Just be careful is all I can say."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good but it could be a bit better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app customised for the westerners. So the motivational stories etc comes when I am in deep work/studies. Other than that It's great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They tricked me into paying a premium membership and took 40 USD from me, even though I cancelled during trial period (20+ days before it ended). They are not answering my tickets, I waited 10+ days for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good and doesn't try and take your money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy app to use Very helpful,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm still getting used to the app again I quit the first time. Now I want to stay for keeps because I know pointers that was given to me worked. Highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I signed up and was charged for a year. I canceled my membership within the first week and submitted for a refund and the company said they would get back to me and I still have not heard from anyone almost 3 weeks after."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Better than I expected"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best üëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really fun and great tracker for mindset habit."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still learning ton use it. But it's fun experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and it's help me a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For anyone that is looking for actual change and feels a need to recenter themselves in their life, whether your life is out of control or you're just looking for a fresh start, this is the app for you and the only app I recommend. It's $40 for a year, but it's worth every penny. I've only been using it for a few days and I've already seen active change in my day to day, plus I'm more energized than I've ever been in the last 12 years. Give this app a try and you won't regret it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing app. I have been struggling with starting and maintaining healthy habits for years. I love how the app breaks it down for you and gives you tips on how to get it done. My longest street was over 70 which is the most consistent I've ever been in my life. Thank you Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the slow approach, it makes all the difference. There are some little things they say they are working out, like being able to update your profile picture and accessing recordings from past challenges. Customer service is very responsive. The app is helping me make important lifestyle changes, one step at a time without overwhelming me with more than I can handle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app to keep you on track!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Far too many notifications. There is nothing about begging for my attention that is endearing nor does it make me feel inclined to use this app, less so paying for it. I have no idea if it would even have done what it was supposed to, it was far too needy for me to find out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good self-help app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm helping myself and having fun without feeling judged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"TRIAL PERIOD NON-EXISTENT, THEY'LL STEAL YOUR MONEY WITHOUT CONSENT The caption is self explanatory. Upon launching, the app states you have a 7-day free trial. I calendar'd 1 week in advance to know when I have to decide upon paying for the full version. Well that was useless because I was charged $58.75 CAD on day 1 of downloading. This app is not worth that money, let alone the devious way they bill you unknowingly. I know I am not the first person to complain about this. Buyer beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This helps me a lot!! I focus better and hold myself accountable more! The morning, focus, and nighttime coaching is phenomenal!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am hopefully that I will finally, after many attempts, create the change I am desiring thanks to Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not safe to use. After I cancelled my subscription, they charged me for 34.99$ and when I emailed them they said it is not refundable. For everyone, IT IS NOT SAFE....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app ever, escpecially for the lazy people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My experience with Fabulous is the most fulfilling and rewarding"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app some times the things are tetras, but I do need to start small and build myself up as when I take big leaps I fall back down"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pretty cool app... However, it'd real damn nice if it didn't completely kill my screen every time... You know I could be in the middle of something important too...it's absolutely infuriating when the screen refuses to sense touch or when my phone just doesn't open any other app until I finish the damn routine..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I installed and took premium membership. But I didn't understand its usage and how was it trying to help. It didn't give any notification neither asked me to do anything unless I remember to open the app myself. This is stupid and cannot even fulfill as an alarm. I installed it in few days only."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really cool it makes feel better about me thank you üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really does help me set new goals for life and even helps me get my life back on track. It is so simple to use and the stories and messages they give are super inspiring!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this app! It has helped keep me motivated and on track with any and all goals I have in mind. My head and heart and body feel relaxed and on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app is great and encouraging but it will take some time to really tell its a slow builder"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A Fabulous App. to start your Day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thus app is so annoying! I stopped using the service but it kept trying to charge my card. It never got authorized but yesterday it just magically charge my Paypal! I didn't even do this! What are you guys doing!? Please please please refund. I haven't used this service and I want a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can you just add a link to the manage subscriptions button? I'm looking to cancel and you are making it very difficult."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best looking"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's way too expensive for these days. the dev of the app probably makes alot of money, but for many people they would think twice to pay just for the app like this when you actually get for free even cheaper in other app. IMO. Be wise to spend your money guys. Hyper inflation is happening. Choose wisely!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best and favorite app for mental health and building habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Careful! They make way to difficult to cancel the trial subscription. So difficult that I had to pay the $39 i didn't want. I want my money back! You can't cancel the subscription on Google play, but you have 5o go through the website. Very disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's best way to know yourself.... I am loving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Osm app and good For teenager"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great but you will pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Firstly, I was offered a 7 day trial to explore the app. After connecting my PayPal, I was charged immediately and not after 7 days as promised. This would not have been a problem if the app had the potential it promised. It does not. If you wished to be notification spammed into oblivion, recommended outdated science or be read magical bedtime stories - this app is for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE..I canceled the free trail and I was still charged...I better get a refund!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Offered premium and then just charged me when the free period was over. Very deceitful and sad way to make money off people. No notifications or emails that they were going to start charging me. It's fraud and we all know this and I am pursuing it through PayPal to try and get my money back. No surprises tho that their policy is NO REFUNDS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i love it but every game I downlode you have to buy some tril and i think it is dumb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App itself is pretty good but they make finding where cancel your subscription extremely and I'm myself searching for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I've been gotten increasingly better at managing my anxiety by maintaining a morning routine that makes me feel good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping me change my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, but just has too much going on"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's very interactive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its amazing üòç They have best features and it's looking great....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app to help me fix Things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"i have been using this app for a while now, and its very useful and cute, but to unlock many features you do need to pay money (obviously), and the ads are very abrupt and difficult about it (i get them almost 3 times a day, and there is not option to stop it). its rather complicated to navigate because they dont give any details, but they have some nice features. the capability for a free user is very limited. fancy, but limited."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not for me. By reading the comments, looks like there is a free version, absolutely nothing suggests this when they show the premium free trial. Then it's a only yearly sub after 7 days of ""free trial"", asking you to drink water and do breakfast for 6 days. Most of the features aren't enabled by this time. You don't know anything, but you need to pay for a year. Lifetime subscription at 350‚Ç¨ (8 years sub). Terrible UX, intrusive notifications. I tried Habits Now for 3.50 and it worked better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing it really made me improve myself and my daily routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They claim to give you a trial, make you subscribe (without being clear) by passing Google Play, send you no warning that trial is expiring and charge you. I had uninstalled the app half through the trial because it's a bubbly-fluffy annoying app for my taste. Cancelling the subscription was another confusing and frustrating process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This seems useful and doesnt intrude too much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its motivational without being hype. Soothes my soul at night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful because it help me to turn from sad, depressed and hurting to happy, great full and fit its definitely a life changer I 100% recommend this app to help improve yourself üëçüèºüòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it's a simple and easy way to get motivated and to help get my thoughts clear some of the suggestions are simple but effective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to like this app, however I feel like I was taken advantage of. I was charged over forty dollars , for what I'm not sure. I signed up for a trial offer, but was charged before the trial should have ended . I don't know why it charged me all at once, gave no option2 pay a monthly. I've contacted help page, requested a refund . I let them know I've been pretty distraught since my son died, as well as homeless and on Social Security only. I can't control anything from the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I know what to do and how to do. I was planning to shift a few columns of google sheets into some applications better suited for tracking. Don't call a ""coach"" app a planner app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Already helping so much and its only been three days"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I loved this application help me to improve so much üëç new habits and to live a better life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thumbs up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is super. I like the stories. It's super and it's definitely help me. This application it's easy to use. The app have everything what you need to your life be better. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Estou tendo uma incrivel experiencia com o Fabolous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is it! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing! I was literally so lazy but fabulous helped me to glow up mentally and physically step by step!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nicely done for your wonderful work experience and I hope you have a great time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I started new but I think it's really helpful app for regulate your brain and your habits. Also the interface with chosen animation are really easier to use and cute."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"very pretty app but you cant do basically anything in it unless you pay for premium üòê"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"LOL. Another scam that gets highly promoted with high paid advertising and fake positive reviews. I feel sorry for people who fall for these scams."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really a great application for habit building. This just not build your habit instead it gives you guidence on each step of achievement. If anyone of you want to change your life with very very less effort, I will definitely recommend this application. This is just like rehabilitation center for your mind and body."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"100% recomendada, en serio esto les cambia la vida si se comprometen a realizar los cambios que se van proponiendo pero la app est√° tan bien hecha que es sencillo seguir motivado"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Fabulous app is changing the way I view life expectantly I am Truly grateful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good start in new way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Needs a free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is good at keeping your attention on fulfilling your goals with constant reminders. This may irritate some but I find it very helpful to keep me in track. The OS is also very encouraging which helps me to want to keep using it. All in all I'm very happy with this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have so many good habits now but it's annoying you have to pay üòí"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice idea, but the subscription model is scetchy at best and I cannot find a function to delete my account (not just unsubscribe) anywhere. No one responded to me email regarding this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I ever tried"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled IMMEDIATELY!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just had to uninstall fabulous because the notification sound wouldn't stop no matter what I did. I've had to restart my phone several times since installing fabulous because fabulous was displaying over other apps and even when I disabled that feature I still couldn't use anything else until I restarted my phone. It is also not optimized for the newest Android software, so what is the use? I should get a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is not compatible with my chaotic lifestyle. I have a really unpredictable job with random day and night shifts. I sometimes sleep durring the day and sometimes durring the night, never the same wake up time. Also I don't do all routines every day like for example exercise and I can't set that up. I wish it was way more customizable. Also one other thing that doesn't sit right with me is those inspirational quotes and ""toxic"" positivity, I just like factual realism and stats."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It was a nice app tho, but charging customers even though we cancelled the free trial is a NO."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating. I truly enjoy every step of my journey with this app :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A brilliant app that really helps inspire and keeps you motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been loving it so far, I really feel hopeful I can actually make a change and better myself. Especially having Fabulous to help push me in the right direction and let's you take baby steps so you don't get overwhelmed like I usually do when I Try to go at making a good change in my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a headache"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good at helping me improve my productivity I've never been this tech savvy in years!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Wish there was no paywall everything else is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great application but very expensive to bear."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is a great app I have become productive and motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's paid app üò∂"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving the fabulous experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's well-made but you can lose your streak of you don't wake up at the same time and do your routine and a lot of the important tools are locked behind a paywall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle reminders in a non aggressive way or wording."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"All features are premium, there's no way to just try out a few things and see how it works before committing to payment. Yes there's a 1 week trial, but we all know how that works. Design an app around people who struggle keeping track of stuff, knowing they'll forget to cancel the trial, enjoy your profit. Cool. No thanks. App itself is BEAUTIFUL though. A+ design work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Totally positive experience!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Shamefull business ethics They will give you so many pop ups with offers for premium free trials that you will not be able to keep up. Eventually they only announce when payment is declined, of course after the commencement date of the new subscription, and no email taht money have been withdrawn from your account as every other serious developer does. No to say than on free trial only few options are available so you are guided to have the premium trial. Whatever. Just so disgusting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using the app for a couple of days. I'm still working on my productivity but none the less i love the consistent coaching. I love how it helps me be more optimistic. Thank you to the developers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I do love this app so much! Very interesting. Not boring. Much fun and very exciting for my brain."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy step by step take to build new positive habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helps me to stay motivated, keep me on track on every habit and brings me hapiness whenever it congratulates me after finishing my tasks. Bravo Fabulous App, you guys are awesome ^^"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to clear your mind as soon as you wake up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app for personal care and improvement of yourselfüî•üî•üî•üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞ü•∞It has brought great changes in my lifestyle and habits. Thank you team Fabulous üòçüëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good way to form healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful and has changed my life. It helps with positive goal setting and has changed how I view the world and my life. I'm in my 50's and for the first time in decades I now exercise everyday (and love doing it) due to the habits formed with the help of fabulous, and have consistently slowly lost a lot of weight. But the weight loss isn't the goal, living my best life is the goal. It works if you work at it, for me it is worth the subscription fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used this for one month. It didn't allow me to choose my own goals. Too many notifications--can't pick and choose which you want. Not very reinforcing. Missed notifications because they come during school and can't be scheduled at your convenience. Took a lot of time. *Had to cancel my debit card to stop the charges.* I had high hopes this would work and paid for subscriptions for my family, but I have ADHD. This did not work for me, my two adult kids with ADHD, or my teenager with autism."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I was skeptical. I am looking to change my life, instill better habits, and habit tracking. I have tried a few other apps. Its only a free week trial but I think I will subscribe and become a premium member. It has motivated me so far to drink more water and eat healthier (which I had been trying to do on my own inconsistently and unsuccessfully). I have some health challenges (physical- sleep apnea, overcome cancer & mental- depression/ PTSD). Also,struggle with clutter. Future looking better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app isn't for me. I'm trying to cancel my 7 day free trial before I get charged but for some reason I can't log in on desktop to be able to do so. I tried contacting support about this issue and the system said they would get back to me in 10 business days. So I'm going to get charged for a whole year for a product I don't want. I don't understand why they make this so difficult. This is a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible user experience, and almost impossible to cancel, don't download this app there are much better habit trackers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't even bother they quoted me a price of $5.99 a month which I thought was quite reasonable for of subscription only to find out that they took a yearly subscription amount out of my account in one hit $69 I went on their website to cancel and get a refund not only was the price of $5.99 a month a lie you can't get a refund you are stuck with it for the entire year that you've paid for do not download this app they are thieves."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Customer support got back to me much slower for a refund than I was told they would, it made me worry if anyone would ever get back to me. I haven't tried the app yet due to worries about not getting a refund, so my review is for the customer service. But it is very easy to accidentally purchase a premium plan as I made the mistake of clicking ""continue"" on a pop up thinking I would be getting more info on a plan but my card was immediately charged without asking for clear confirmation at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seemed interesting until I reached the Black Screen Of Uninstall This App."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is UNREAL. It's for anyone and everyone. Definitely a MUST !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The worst experience. They charged me $40 because it takes 10 days to return an email if at all to cancel this subscription (not able to cancel via google). I am livid that after asking and being granted a refund it never showed and no response. Horrible company !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Once most who do download the app are introduced by the free trial same as me. After the free trial was up I've tried unsubscribing and yet Fabulous Co. continues to bill me monthly for a subscription I don't want. Even more than that, why wouldn't they make it accessible to unsubsidized or manage your subscription through the app especially when most other apps that have a subscription do this?! Behavior like this proves that they only want ur money :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great interface!ƒ±"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am furious that my card was charged after I canceled my free trial membership Not only did they take $40 but they took my last $40"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled subscription and won't give refund"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged for a one month subscription, I canceled it a day after trying the app. Yet two weeks later they still billed my bank account 54$ I'm also keep in mind low income with kids, this company hasn't responded to my emails and I think other app users should be aware of this problem. Every sure loves to pay for something they don't have rite ?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great program"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is truly helping me to see a path forward to work through my ADHD and not let life just happen to me. No therapy I have done has helped me in this area of my life like this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very positive experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous..Loving it ..It would be nice to store our photos while following new pratices or habits under daily routine"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a really helpful app without paying a prescription,so if you we're to pay for prescription you would be even happier with your experience,so definitely recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I came from CHAD CHAD and omg this is the best üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too much engaging..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good place to develop yourself to be the better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"i tried the free trial and it didn't meet up to the expiereince, so i uninstalled it and the trail diddnt appear on my Google subscriptions so i thought it was taken off my expenses only to be charged ¬£40, when I didn't have the app anymore. Other than that the graphics are nice and if i had the time and finances i would try it out more seriously.Mechanics are a bit confusing.I have been trying to contact the team for over a week and i have not heard a word form them, every day my anxieties grow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beginner friendly goal setting!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not useful. The only clear recommendation for me was to drink water once I wake up. Don't think it wort the money I paid for a subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've been using the app for yoars on IOS. Switching from Apple to Google Pixel had a couple of kinks in the process. But I guess that competing monopolies wouldn't want it any othet way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A very encouraging app to help you establish healthy routines. I'm liking it so far. The only issue I had was a glitch were I completed a 3 day goal and it did not recognize it till I completed day 4. Otherwise, it has a lot of encouragement and science to help you on your way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Started a trial for 7 days but they did not send any notification before charging the amount and it was deducted before 7 days completed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please don't get this app, unsubscribing from the free trial is a nightmare. They say you're unsubscribed then charge you after the free period is over."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Would like to upgrade to premium, but no option to use Google Play to pay. Why is that?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works if you work it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulous is fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think this is an amazing app very useful for people like me who struggle with motivation this app has given me a reason to get out of bed in the morning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome , i love so much . Please make it free üôÅ here in my country we don't have what is required for buying it ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Promising but one of the first things it asked was what time I usually wake up, then says something along the lines of 'to start with a successful morning routine wake up at the same time every day', impossible when working shifts. Uninstalled as I feel it will be too rigid for shiftwork life, would be good to see a flexible version for people working variable shifts"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb Where has this app been all my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a wonderful self care coaching ap!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP!!!!! I have struggled with all sorts of bad things mental and physical my whole life and I finaly decided to get the help I deserve and need this app is a great help building and helping me follow schedules. It encourages me to be healthier and see myself as someone who is worthy, it has surrounded me by people who understand me and what I am going through and give so much positivity to help keep you reaching your goals. 1000/10 I HIGHLY recommend this app to allüíóüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåªOne Love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app is too good it's helps me to set my routeen ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too streak-focussed for someone with a chronic illness. Being intermittently derailed by an IBS flare and reset to zero repeatedly is demoralising. Also moves too fast, pushing you to add new habits after only a few days. I've tried restarting several times but this system just doesn't work for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable. Someone posted a picture of a horrific wreck they were in. I said, ""Thank God you're okay!"" It wouldn't allow me to post it because I typed a word that some may find ""offensive."" Good grief! I'm glad I didn't pay for the premium. I'm canceling my free trial right now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying this app as an aid to improve my well-being and self care! I love how it game-ifies building good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was so close to suicide and a link on my YouTube showed up while I was procrastinating. The link sent me to this app. Thank you so much! There are no words to thank you for saving my life! I have ADHD, depression, anxiety and physical disabilities. I was getting tired of it. Thank God this app stepped in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Three days in. So far I've found the app to be very helpful. Lots of great content. And the habit tracker is designed to nurture your ability to build habits. I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app had billed me twice for a yearly subscription. They don't do refunds so it really feels like they are stealing money and running. Also when you go to cancel it isn't in the app to cancel it which should be illegal, anyway so I went to the app. The app tells me to go online, and all that pops up is their terms of sevrice so I had to go through the terms of sevrice and find it and all it says is here is an email and you can do it on the app so idk what to do or if they will respond."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ye this app is great. ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èüí∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Takes forever to get in, video intros for everything. Toxic positivity 'encouragement' feels patronizing. The restriction & hand holding feels paternalistic. Creates non-stop pop-ups, interruptions, and 'Just one more thing'. Pop-ups are terrible, they're worse when they're patronizing... Interruptions should pop in from the bottom of the screen, should not disrupt you from doing what you're doing in the app. They can be dismissed, or read in a moment when you choose to."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great and inspirational. Great description and help me to build great habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My life has changed and the circles are helping me see the future me . Thank you Fabulous üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"These people are scammers and spammers. They email you every single day until you sign up. Then I signed up for premium, and they charged me twice in one month. Contacted them for support multiple times, never heard back. Going to have to talk to my bank."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This App is wonderful! It goes slow so be patient and stick with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gosto do aplicativo mas a partir do momento que me faz perder tempo procurando tarefas que eu devo fazer perde todo o sentido do app. A falta de uma comunidade para tirar d√∫vidas e um suporte descente que nao me deixe 10 dias √∫teis aguardando tamb√©m me fez dar essa nota."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has helped me maintain healthy habits, a positive attitude, better approach and has given me a different view towards things. I'm so grateful that I found this app. 08/07/2022 I'm back to this app, a year later and it's still the best."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful app. Difficult to cancel as well. Do not subscribe if you don't wanna get into problem later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very useful! Thanks for it to be. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app locks you out of other apps, isn't customizable at all, and charged me the full annual subscription fee after I had cancelled my subscription, don't waste your time or money. Try Wondr Note if you'd like something helpful, it's a fraction of the price, way more user friendly, and actually customizable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Slowly but surely bringing Fabulous into my day. It brings positivity and I am beginning to establish the necessary habits for a better day. I am happy with the app so far. Let's see what it brings in the future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Seems like it would be good but only after doing this big set up it tells you you have to pay. Really wish it would tell you you need to pay before making you do the set up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sensational....!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Same issue as described by someone else. Activated a trial and a promo -- was uncertain if it even took. I was charged without any warning during a promo period. Can't manage your subscription in app -- says to go to the website but doesn't give the address. Super sketch, very disappointed that they create confusion with their many offers, put barriers to cancellation, don't apply the promo they offer, and don't warn of trial ending. Aside from that, app is too flashy and overly complicated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the first app/system which is working for me. Gentle reminders coming from something not me works wonders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Goor evening, I would like to use tha app unfortunately I can't proceed. I guess there's something wrong with the app right now. There's only blue color that appeared on my screen with the box below. I hope you can give me some guide on how to use it properly. Your fast reply will be much appreciated"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is an excellent app it helped me so much in feeling energized , keep up the good work üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice.and.helpfull"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used to be useful. For the last few days, it refuses to finish anything unless I take a free 7 day upgrade. If it persists I will just uninstall it. I'm 70 yrs old and don't have money for any apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still at the beggining. I've been using the app for two days. Like it so far. Will update eventually"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best aap ... Of all time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app and Nguyen Anh Kiet as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. It has helped me to accomplish so much already and i've only had it for a week. Now every day I wake up the first thing i do is drink a glass of water, meditate, strech and have breakfast. I've tried many habit developing apps and this one is honestly the most effective one yet. I recommend it very much. P.S. Thank you with all my heart to the developers of this great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A great app indeed it but it seems like it's strictly for women, what about the dudes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, I have used it and deleted it multiple times. I'm now using it to improve my mental health more than physical"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It motivates me to be a better me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Beautiful very beautiful app its really relaxing and reliable But still lacks other facilities"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is great app l will feel relax using this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just love everything about the App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is wonderful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It would be 5 stars if they didn't ask for money multiple times a day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am so glad my Coach introduced this app to me. I am enjoying a very robust experience. It is a complete app. I love it so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app and it keeps you accountable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very well made"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I like it. However I would like widgets as a premium subscriber. It would be nice to be able to choose a routine to stick to my home screen without having to always go to the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So lovely"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After every task or somthing like that it's like premium premium premium So much begging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am so grateful for this great application!!!!! it's a Heaven sent application! I was able to monitor my daily habits one at a time and Im so happy!"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Never seen such application before .. Believe me guys fabulous will completely change your life.. Love you fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good application for fixing mental health."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and gives gentle reminders to do things we know we should do but often put off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"$40 A YEAR? You better ask somebody. Thanks for replying, but I was prompted a 7 dayfree trial, and in order to use it or the app, I was automatically prompted for my credit card/PayPal. There are thousands of similar apps that don't ask for a CC/PayPal in order to use ""free features and services"". You emailed me a 30-day trial, which I appreciate as 7 days is not long enough to experience the vast benefits of this app before paying $40 for an app during inflation & impending recession. Yo. üëé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Apparently I subscribed a year ago for a free trial and forgot to cancel. Apparently the app is so underwhelming, I forgot it existed. I don't remember anything about it and don't believe I ever used it. When I saw it on PayPal statment last month, I cancelled it immediately. I see that others get a refund when they cancel. I cancelled a day or two at most and I can't get a refund. Horrible business practices to not refund something not used. I have opened a claim for service not received."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far üëçüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive planner to help focus good intentions x"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"AMAZING, Fabulous is my support system‚ô•Ô∏é"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Agree with multiple reviews. The app gives you every opportunity to join, create and enable a subscription. But no place to view, edit, cancel or remove your complete account. During initial setup I immediately need to choose a subscription and only one week for free. The time is too short to at last try such an app. Really a shame."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fun and easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You are the best in the world."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I have had it for over a year now. I recently started a new EA Job with a Therapy genre YouTube channel and found out they did a sponsorship with the Fabulous team prior to me working there. Coincidence yes, but I swear it is like I was meant to find this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm sorry but I am very unhappy with the app. I was charged 39‚Ç¨ for the premium app options without being asked if I wanted to have the premium services. I payed 5‚Ç¨ to get the app because I wanted to know what I could do with it, but I never got to ""choose"" if I wanted to keep this app or continue to paying the full service. I am disappointed, angry, and feel robbed. . UPDATE July 5th 2022. No refund. Just robbed. DONNOT GET THIS APP it is NOT ADHD friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beyond description. Transformative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app that helps you in guiding you to become a better person. I got a promotion where the premium upgrade is just rm3.33, very cheap, thank God. You dont need to follow the instructions 100% all of the time. Just answer honestly, because this is just like a game, where you are the main character. And you want the main character to get high score"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a fantastic App. It has really motivated me to get the best out of each day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"it's amazing, has been helping me a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A very positive and straightforward app. Fabulous really found a way to be helpful with mindfulness during the day. I've never been very organized but I feel as lot better for it as of right now. I'll continue to use this app. Though I will say I wish more was available without payment. It isn't a reason not to continue using it though. Beautiful artwork plus routine planning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful design and very motivational. I can see it making a difference in my life. A little suggestion, for someone like me who is looking to get better at organisation, there could be a little less messages through the day from the app. I find it to be adding to the stress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Designed very well, gives all the endorphin hits upon completion of tasks. Has helped me to spend less time on socials in the morning and evening, and helped me to develop better habits like brief study before bed and staying focused on the right things during the day. Totally worth paying for it year round, they've done an excellent job creating an app that works for its intended purpose"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Who knew it would be this easy! (so far)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice i hope its help me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èit helps a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i tried to exit the payment right after giving my paymentmethods and its made soo difficult fot you - not a very professional way to sell your app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I WAS loving this app and starting to develop some healthy habits. It was fun to keep track of my progress and I was enjoying the increasing levels. However, something happened and all my data was lost. Now, to get it back I have to subscribe??? I can't afford that. In fact, I cancelled the subscription not too long ago. What use use this to me if I have you stay at the beginning? That's discouraging and will only reinforce idea that I'm inconsistent and can't keep a trend going. Please h"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great it really helped me so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not for me. The interface is beautiful and well designed, however it is hard to navigate. You actually have to spend a lot of time in the app instead of getting things done. It also send ls a lot of notifications some of which, ironically, tell you to disconnect from your phone... I didn't see any benefit that a simple reminder could not replace. Maybe I wasn't able to see the full potential of the app as the 7 day trial was not sufficient but unfortunately it didn't help me at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It helps...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has helped me start up healthy habits that I've been wanting to do for years. I have a handful of autoimmune diseases, so it's nice to have small, fun tasks to take my mind off them, all while making a better life for myself. It's a great journey so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good to be honest. I've had no trouble with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's clear the owners of the app are only after money, taking advantage of us who already have a lot going on in their mind. If they cared about the user, instead of calling it ""a misunderstanding"", they would fix what many are having issues about and send automatic emails like other apps to remind them before charging. Instead, they're taking advantage of people's ""confusion"" to take their money. I wouldn't care if they had charged a few bucks for a month but they charged me for a whole year!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is totally a scam. I first time registered but they charge directly without 7 days of trial. And how can annual plan but I have to pay every month. Can you please refund my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app. Signed up and subscribed for free week via PayPal. Now unable to sign into app without being asked for payment details again. All I want to do is login!! And cancel. I do Not want charging for a year membership. Not impressed. No idea where to get help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing application!!! I learned so much from it and it assisted my in several thing that made my life so much better!!!!! üå§Ô∏èüåª‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÉüçì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"After paid the Premium need to ReInstall the app to update your account status. Why I do not receive any notification email regarding charges on my card even CANNOT USE ANY PREMIUM SERVICES AFTER AGREED TO THE OFFER?! Why the app turn blank after you agreed to trial subscription ?! ..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gamification at its finest! Beautifully designed, produced, delivered. In love!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful with this app! It's cute looking and all, might be the right thing for some persons, but if it did not work for you, You'll get a subscription which won't show up anywhere on your Google account and they will make it close to impossible to cancel it. No heads up about a continuation and even though I started paying after a 7 day free period, they billed me ahead of that time. I'm feeling scammed at this point having to pay annual subscriptions which they just don't make transparent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's life changing go for it!! I deleted other 13 self help apps and I'm keeping this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like having a personal assistant that pushes you and reminds you to be better than the day before"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"To pushing for money not genuine enough for me I can most of this I don't see anything this adds more than anything else"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute SCAM! Took $70 from my account and when I unsubscribed they did not refund. DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS STUPID APP!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fair warning. If you sign up for the 7 day free trial through the WEB BROWSER, it will not show up in the app store for you to cancel if you don't like it. I find that to be incredibly sneaky on their part and they've probably gotten a lot of people's money that way. If you sign up for the subscription ANYWHERE it should show up in your subscription list. Period. I did not want to pay for this app and now I have due to manipulative design and marketing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a paid app only - has 1 week free trial but not a free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app might look a little confusing in the glance, but once you dig into it, you realize your just some how more productive and on the right path towards your goals. I decided to get the premium because this app is literally fabulous. I tried a lot of different apps for productivity but they are not anywhere near to this one, I highly recommend it. And I suggest they should make the free trial longer maybe like 30 days, however 7 days was enough for me to realize how important are my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivational app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love this app but I can't stand all the notifications. The only notifications want reminder and routine notifications. Between the life coaching, quotes and circle things I constantly have notifications that I just delete and then I forget to do the things I need to do. There currently isn't a way to set what you want and there needs to be. It makes the app almost unusable for people with ADHD or ADD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If you decide to unplug from screens for a day(or go camping), you are unable to keep your records. Also, a 7 day trial is not long enough to see if this app is good for your lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Poor customer service! I can't get through to anyone, and the app won't let me upload an image on the help section so I cannot submit a ticket!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it! It's so user-friendly and it allows me to track my habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Now way to cancle subscription. I wanted to check the app out before considering a subscription. You have to select a plan to start you trial. But then in the app there is no way to cancel to subscription at all period. Going to the website is a joke there is no way to access your account at all so canceling you subscription they is non existent. I contacted them to cancel with no reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Positive vibes, maybe adding some ideas about parents with children because sometimes it hard for to keep a track of things because I have to do my children my children are no hassle just wish there was away I could do it with them and track them as well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the stories. The narrator isn't very soothing for me and I like it if there was some ambience music like rainfall. Or relaxing tones. Also being able to adjust the pace of speech or change to different cultural voices makes a difference. But I absolutely love the cute narrative that is what made me gave you 5 out 5. Well done buddy üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is very bad app mene jab is me apna email dala to vo continu hi nahi ho raha tha"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"i enjoy this thing, doing it a second time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really helped me to improve myself.I realised that I didn't give myself much time to reflect .But as soon as I started proceeding with the challenges and tasks presented to me by fabulous,I realised within a week that I was getting fabulous! Thankyou so much the makers of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the app and it has helped me create a morning and night routine but I wish I could see my previous months progress on the progress tab. I want to be able to go back and see a real outline of my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Niceüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You are holding my refund! You suddenly charged my card!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it, a little helper to keep you on a positive path"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life! Thank you so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find it very admirable. Seeing just some simple routine make me believe i can have routine, a healthy one. It's not even a week but I'll have subscription after this free week, for sure!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great App! Helps keep you focused with out being to annoying. One suggestion would be to make repeat function for certain routines. example every other day or every other Saturday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It needs to have more ""habit icon"" for adding new habits or if there was an option for adding our own photo would be better. The alarm is limited to week and hour. I love doing a few types of habits more than once a day and I don't want to create new routine for each time and there isn't also biweekly, every two days and so on... If we could edit habits that were created by challenge, it'd be better too. I like we could create our own challenge, too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It made me motivated. I like it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for improving your life by building good habits. I've only been using it a week, but already seeing the results and future potential üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, pretty good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It make me feel good about myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too complicated. I lost track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome .. ü§©ü§© Please provide for indians too and available for banks like canara ,Andhra,SBI Banks.i should say takes less amount for planning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"this app is stuck at the step where it asks wether to send emails or not i am not able to continue it please help!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only early days but feeling a flutter of hope in my being about my journey forward üåªüåª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the best App ever,so perfect and Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I started using this app when it first came out years ago. Loved it and what it was designed to do. Don't see myself going back to it because you have to start the same way every time. I'd like to start with a night routine, or midday routine, but you always have to start in the morning with their journeys and work your way up. Maybe one day they'll change it and I'll come back as a customer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really really really really really really appreciate you guys... it's really worth installing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is ABSURB. I got charged AUD 67.99 first for an annual subscription that was advertised for 75%off (AUD 49.99 AUD). Then I get charged AUD 62.99, 7 days after that! Edit: The issue was quickly handled after the response to my review. Thanks for that!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got offerred 7 day trial and then they extended the trial to 30 days buy after 7 days they tried to charge me for 1 year subcription which I tried to cancel the same day, because I got tricked. I cant seem to cancel the current subcription even after sending them an email asking to stop tryjng to charge my card for a subscriptuon I didnt even use. At least if you trick customers with 30 days trial, dont try to charge after 7 days or at least offer a refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very relatable and helpful guide to daily improvement . Love the sounds and rythms"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App for building a solid foundation for healthy routines! This app starts you off slow to prevent you from being overwhelmed. Give it a few weeks and the next thing you know: you've developed a healthy foundation to keep you Healthy, and Happy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"A predatory mess. I have ADHD, so I decided to check it out. The app itself is horrible; buggy, with a user interface that constantly hides features and no customization. The worst offender is the billing by far, it's an outright scam, after the trial it renew and tried to charge me even though I had already cancelled the account, the billing department is non-existant and I keep getting pay requests sent to my card. I sent a support ticket and of course, no response. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me on track, reminds me of how the ""little things"" add up to a big, happy impact on life. It is also encouraging and the motivations make me smile."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So confusing! Can't delete routines. When I open the app, the chances of me sticking around when so much is going on, is highly unlikely. When listening to a downloaded audio segment, there is no option to just read it, you have to play it and listen to it. If you missed something, you can't rewind or fast forward. You have to listen to it all over again. Trying to make a change is difficult and uncomfortable. making things even worse, is not helpful. I have more, but runnin out of space..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a life saver. I have a horrendous time staying in the moment of today and this app helps me be in the now, instead of the horrible past I've had or the future that I want to happen. This app reminds you that this day hasn't existed yet, ever, so make the choose to make it a good day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I want to upgrade to premium but there is no G-cash payment option."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, very fabulous indeed also very motivational, inspiring and beautiful. This app just makes productivity fun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It almost do list for daily. But it contains many quotes and science facts about willpower and habit. Those would be biggest impact on your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good to make habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription on day 1 as wanted to test the app and wasn't suited for me. Despite email proof of this cancellation, I was still charged $62.99 AUD a week after I signed up, even though the initial sign up suggested a 30 day free trial. Having seen various other reviews outlining the payments being taken despite cancelling, I sent them 2 emails after receiving my cancellation email to confirm no charges would be made. I've yet to receive a response to either of these messages."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using it for a week. I really enjoy the daily coaching the best. I don't have time to exercise in the morning because I work split shifts, I would like to move it to the afternoon which is when I have time. But there is no afternoon routine yet"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waste of money and similar to amazon in terms of cancelling membership - purposely difficult to leak you dry."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Feel really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the 7 day free trial, obviously to see if I liked it, but was immediately charged $54.99. I canceled right away and emailed customer service, they haven't been helpful at all. No refund or anything as of yet. Customer service is abysmal. They claimed they would contact me and STILL haven't"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yeah this app is worths the money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its nice to get some reminders to make things a habit. That's all what I wanted from this app. Also there is some good advice. Though there are some customization options for the alarm (or rather routines) missing that I personally would like to have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. But I can no longer access the coaching sessions. A voice announces session. But there is no button to click to play the session. How to fix this? Do you have a help telephone line?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"not bad, not bad. its not as selfintrousive like the other motivational apps, i might keep this one until i feel like i have improved my daily life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm doing the two week trial and the app is gorgeous and super well made. There are lots of ""journeys"" you can take to create better habits and routines. Just wish you could do more than one at a time without having to pause them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love everything about this app I highly recommend it üëåüèæ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has changed my life like literally."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hard to navigate even though I'm tech savvy. Signed up for 14 day trial for free, canceled same day..offered 30 day trial for $1. Signed up & canceled same day so it will auto stop after 30 days. But got charged $39.99 after 13 days. Even though I canceled both the same day. It's been several days & not getting any response from refund request. Got reply from General support telling me to do refund form...when I told them I did it already, they stopped responding to me. They are horrible!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love this app it actually motivated me to exercise I also downloaded another app that's related to fabulous called Reverie and its even better!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"So far so good. I have only been using this app. For three days. Will definitely update."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You stole my money!!! I want it back immediately!!! I'm on a 30 day free pass a couple of days in you try and deduct over R600 from my card ( no where near 30 days!!!) Then I try and cancel and uninstall this app because clearly the loop he's are there to steal your money and now you deduct my money for the app I've already gotten rid of. And guess what were still no where near the 30 days. Disgusting!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it's teaching me so much I'm loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app really a life changer"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely a fantastic app. Will surely use it everyday. Found my routine app üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"At first a little hard to get into the zone,but persevere,it becomes really helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is changing my life for the better, at a pace that I can actually cope with. A lot of hard work and care clearly went into making this. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I feel like I'm doing great progress in terms of my diet, fitness, and mental health! I've only been using this for a little over a week but so far it's been working wonders! I started off with small challenges and they've slowly but surely become a part of my daily routine. The app offers many different journeys and provides so many inspirational readings and my favorite part is how the app challenges me to add a new habit into my daily routine and will provide several examples! Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible; they shove the membership down your throat with every opportunity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Motivates one to do a task no matter how lazy they are."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, very supportive and motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled because I didn't like it and here a week later they charged me for the full year anyways very pissed off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far I love it but I have only used it for a few days so I cannot comment on long term use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Keeps me organised, healthy and on track morning, noon and night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Initial purchasing of subscription charged me multiple times, flagged my bank and locked my account. Had to get a new phone and transfer apps, but I can't access my subscription due accidentally clicking on signing on with Google instead of e-mail even though they're based on the same account. I contacted support about cancelling the trial on my app so that I can sign on through email, but support won't reply to my multiple requests for help. I may be forced to flag the charges as fraudulent now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app to find inspiration to keep going. Takes some days getting used to though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been an amazing help to my ADHD brain. I get easily distracted and Fabulous keeps me on track for my goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has been a great way to treat myself, help manage my anxiety and goals in manageable, realistic steps. I'm looking forward to trying out all the different journeys. The account info was a bit confusing at first when setting up my plan, but I did eventually figure it out and I am happily an annual premium member."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best hab app ever. I can't stick to a routine to save my life. My adhd time blindness is severe and this app is slowly adding to my day in a way that is fun and sustainable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That letter from future me had done so much positive change to my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You must help me more than you have helped me now. But I can not pay by phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely like the app. It's great for me because it takes things at a nice pace and it feels effortless to make minor changes in life that have a great impact."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, I haven't bought the unlocked version but I love the platform and the little messages !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great idea, terrible execution Downloaded the app to get my daily schedule in there and some habits I would like to build. Immediately after onboarding you are bombarded with payment prompts and anything you try to do is locked behind pay wall... They give you 7 day trial saying it costs 3.33czk (about 10cents) a month and when you are like ""sure I can pay that much for a year"" it's suddenly 1100czk for 12 months with 50% off... That is even after 50% off about 30x more than they say in the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great reminders to daily do a little something good for your self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Loved it at first. Paid 1$ and almost two weeks in i get a 39.99 charge to my account from Fabulous I didnt authorize and PayPal won't reverse it because its apparently a subscription Fabulous set up without my permission. I am devastated! I contacted support and have no idea if they even got my ticket! Very upset"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has made such an impact in my life! So much so that my bestie is using her free trial now! And it's already making a huge impact in her life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has changed my life. I more have healthy habits, morning and evening routines that make me more productive and help me manage my anxiety."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This application will help you to take a Changes in your life üòäüå∫"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really helps me to set up a daily routine. I hardly recommend Fabulous App, especially if you already tried to be consistent and motivated, but you keep failing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautifully made, one step at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I actually LOVE this app, and didn't expect to. They're big on not overloading yourself with new habits all at once, and have tools ready to help, which makes each goal that much more attainable. Bad at cleaning? A timer starts, and you only tidy a space for 10 minutes. Dreading your morning workout? A timer starts, and you have premade workouts that guide you through a seven minute workout that is TOTALLY doable. Each small step feels like a huge accomplishment, and helps me go further!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just starting but good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate this app. Especially the daily coaching. It's vibrantly colorful, cute and unique. It's simple yet effective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I hate that long intro when u open app. Good app overall tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Fabolous is the life saviour for me ...I was so stuck and I feel the drak negative clouds around me , but now! Things are changing day by day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app does not work at all well with my tablet. It only works 1/4 directions. It unfortunately only works vertical one way, which is too heavy for my tablet and also won't allow me to charge my tablet, so I cannot use if I am low on battery which I usually am. Not functional!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription to this app last year after a year subscription. Now I get emails that payment didn't go through, of course it won't go through I cancelled it and blocked it from my card. Please stop sending me emails."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't fall for it. It exploits my ADHD and not only tricked me into pain $16 for free trail. yes somehow. I also signed up for reoccurring charges for $40 a month! The worst part is I have not even opened the app since the end of my free""free trail"" if you ever still has the audacity to charge me for an app I have not even downloaded since I concluded my ""free trial"". Save yourself some money and do this: create a goal, work on it for 3 days in a row, rinse and repeat. Add all the goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is beautiful and fairly easy to set-up. I found that the routines were rather basic and it was designed for individuals starting on their self care journey. When I tried to navigate to cancel my subscription, the in-app experience was confusing as it never showed a subscription and kept linking me back to google play. Contacting their support team is a terrible and no one reads their emails. Don't sign up if you aren't 100% sure you want to pay for this bc you wont get your money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App quite slow but well done. Be careful though it's not straight forward at all to opt out of the free trial, quite sly. But after complaining the team refunded me a few days later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have really enjoyed this app. I love the coaching and different interest available. I only wish I knew how to utilize this app to its full potential. It has taken me a while to learn how to use it. Overall, I really recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too simplistic... does not account for younalready accomplishing the goal prior to the app. Not personalized at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great to help declutter your mind and sort out a routine to get you on the right path."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Massive scam. Charges were taken without my consent and getting a refund is impossible. I have been trying to speak to a human for 3 weeks. AVOID!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A real helpful and Cool app to help you creat new habits. I highly recommend it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you üçÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the free trial. After one day I decided I did not like the app. Cool nbd. The app said to cancel my subscription go through google play. I did they said I'm not subscribed through them. I emailed the app no response. A two weeks later I was charged. Still haven't gotten through to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A practical step by step approach to setting and achieving goals, however small, to a better, healthier, motivated and happier you. To enable you to get out of a slump and move forward. Great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Company is only in it for the money. Requested a refund 3 days after I was charged. They took 20 days to get back to me and refused to refund my $. I'll keep the app for my year and will make sure to not recommend the app anymore. I got back on the app today and it froze on me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Deymm broo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liking it so far guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I have nothing to complain about the app =)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When l logged in my email address and tried pressing continue it refused"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful, easy and informative. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I still love it. It's an all around self care/motivator APP that touches everything you need to progress as a human, so you won't need a ton of different, habit making, goal, inspirational, mental health, etc, APPs taking over your device. It's all here! I love that its step by step, going as slow or as fast as you'd like. There's coaching and community available. Multiple journey types that can be personalized. Tons of information and it's really unlimited and worth the money in my opinion!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This has been STRESSFUL and BAD experience. Quite the opposite of what was advertised. I signed up a number of days ago but could not access my account. I emailed support as well as sent a ticket through the website to cancel my subscription to stop ANY charges the same day. I recieved NO RESPONSE until last night. none of the info was helpful at all it just suggestions and links, no contact with someone who can assist or confirm cancellation. I was charged 55 for a service I did not get."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good! üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous worküëå I also recommend reading the book "" Tiny Habits "" written by professor Bj Fogg. The book is a great supplement to this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am in love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Looks good, but it has too many pop-ups (not ads, really pop-ups explaining the app). Extremely annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Organizing the day with no pressures"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app offers a usefull tool to really build amazing habits. Ive yet to really catch on to a new habit but I feel like this app will help me push through."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's awesome app...managed very well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is just amazing and so motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Used it for a week. So far so very very good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A Fabulous Habit building app that offers support and challenges along the way. This caters to your personal approach to goals and gives you additional ideas and motivation to enhance your daily routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Apps like this shouldn't have monthly costs. I don't know about anyone else, but these apps are supposed to be help and support for people with depression and other mental health issues. People that don't/can't work for example, or do but can't afford health care or maybe on lengthy waiting lists for this kind of help. I know it's not a lot of money, but I work full time and the thought of having to pay for another thing monthly/annually only adds to my worries of being able to afford things :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is well made but not my cup of tea. What I really disliked is the is the subscription model. The trial is somewhat forced onto you, and then you're up for a goose chase to cancel is again. Not in the app, nor in the playstore. On their website. And there it's also somewhat hidden. Once you click of ""cancel premium"" you're shown what you'll be missing. Obviously you'll have to scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the small grey text to confirm your decision again. Sketchy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Waiting for a reply to my email,as the app has not restored my data onto my new phone. Would appreciate assist thank you. EDIT: I don't have the time, sorry, you already have emailed me twice and I you. You have my details. Thank you I look forward to hearing again. 27/6 EDIIT: Clearly you're not planning to get in touch to resolve the issue with your app in my account, so ill start again at the beginning. I'm sorry you're not responsive to the issue."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ooo this is very awesome app... I love this.. Plz try it üíïüòçüëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam and makes it purposefully difficult to unsubscribe and does not offer refunds when the time goes over Beware, they have responded to my review as well and I have followed their steps which did not help me cancel their subscription. I have read the response to my review and it does not change my views on how this app aproaches unsubscriptions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Does what I want it too. Feels encouraging. I think a calendar might help for thibgs you don't do daily."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I keep getting an error message that my phone isn't compatible and the touch screen stops working. I usually have to reboot my whole phone in order to be able to use my phone at all after that. However, I don't see an update or any notice when I installed that it wouldn't work with me phone. Otherwise, I am really enjoying the app and want to keep using it, IF I can get it to stop doing that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just one word! AMAZING! You need to spend time on it though and become familiar with it once you got that, boom!! it works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled but they charged me anyway. UPDATE: Refund request had me answer a couple of questions to determine my eligibility for a refund. All responses led to the same stock answer. What terrible client care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best free app I've found!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will steal your money and save your credit card on their database"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely amazing and helps you have a better and healthier life and I recommend people that are having trouble or want something like this all should definitely install it üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As the name suggest its fabulous üòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The main problem with it, is that you can't pay monthly, BUT it is arguably, one of the beat habit creator appa ive used. As someone who gets easily destracted and overwhelmed ive found this app extremely useful to remember what it is i am needing to focus on."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app to spur you on with daily checkin ins so you don't feel that your alone. Gives focus to the goals you set and you can cleay see and celebrate your progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seems like a good app for habit learning, but at times it can be a bit confusing what to do when."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Motivating. Keeps you accountable to yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The billing is a mess. They charged twice posted on the same date. After I disputed one charge with credit card company, they cancelled my premium even though they still charged me once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been charged for an annual membership twice now and canceled both. Stop charging me when I already canceled!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gentle, easy way to build a better me. Beautiful colorful drawings and writings. The coaching makes a staggering impact 3 times a day. The habit and routine process really work for making sense of your day and making room to achieve your goals. They even send personal, easily-understood answers to questions one might email. Reasonably priced FOR A LIFELONG TOOL. Might well be the very best app I've yet to uncover."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"These notifications are ridiculous. They will spam your phone with notifications it makes me not even wanna use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They show love . True simple love ‚ù§ üòç üíñ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is so helpful and it reminds you when u have to do something gives instructions etc. Overall this app I awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good , it's like a magic ü™Ñüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the subscription right away but got billed 2 more times. stay away, dishonest business"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app This app helped me improve my life and make it better. Thanks Fabulous üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"""does not work for the lastest version of Android"" is what I get when I press certain locations on my screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a helpful tool to go back to snd have check up on working out my routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for a week and it's good .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like how the app is made. It helps me doing the tasks in difficult moments just because of the motivation it gives me. It's also nice that there are always coming new ideas of how I could improve my life even better. For me it's worth the money if you really want to improve your life and it's not always that easy. I also checked many other apps like this and none quite like Fabulous. Don't wait with your success and just start changing your life with me :) You will not regret it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscription during the free trial, got a cancellation confirmation and was still charged the full amount and told that the cancellation didnt go through properly. Had to cancel my credit card so that they dont charge my card again. I wish I could give 0 stars. Too many prompts that actually turn a person off"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's been good since I started using it I just hope the notifications come on time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They care and encourage you to do the same."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app! Seemed to really help keep me on track. Sadly don't have the funds in my budget to have a subscription. Maybe sometime in the near future!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"too complex for daily routine app in my opinion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was so ready to improve my habits but this app actually made it harder than doing it myself. I tried for months to make it work but the app experience comes off manipulative and pretentious, unless you fit their profile of someone w no behavior sci education who only likes whimsical art. The ""Fabulous"" theme is forced on you constantly. You're told it works & given daily opportunities to opt out of sharing. If customization exists, it comes with pop-ups discouraging you from using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be aware: So interesting that they only accept payments through the app so subscription is not manageable from Google Store but somehow for cancelation you have to go to ""fabulous web portal"" that i am not sure where it is. These thieves make it difficult to cancel so you end up paying ...and they do not have to refund. Trust me i will cancel my credit card...i dispute the payment and i will take you to court if i have to but you won't get a dime out of me!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did the one week free trial and was no option to cancel my subscription as I did not wish to continue. Despite trying to cancel I have still been charged the full amount for an appt I do not want and have unistalled. Fabulous have not replied to any of my emails and have cancelled my previous reviews. Please Fabulous can you respond."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is pretty good, but the subscription is too expensive and without it you can't do much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fav lol!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Looked good until the free trial. Says free 7 days but requires a card... if it free for 7 days, let me do the 7 days and decide if I want to give you my card number at the end of it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous allows me to set alarms as reminders for the habits I'm trying to build. For me, that is essential."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So disappointed in customer service. Unable to cancel trial (days before it ended) and was charged $54.99 Unable to contact a real person! So disappointed. * edited to add* Thanks for your response. Yes you did state that however, none of the options worked nor did the links that were provided to me. They were also the links that I had found myself. I have reached out to customer service, repeatedly and will continue to do so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was ripped off. I was told i will get a 2 days notice prior charging my card and suddenly my card was charged without a notice. In the first trail day the app was confusing and worst UX. Edit: You did not answer the question why you have charged my credit card without sending the 2 day prior notice within the 7 days trial?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Absolutely amazing and influential app.It helped me to tackle with the habit that I've been trying to banish since 14 and now I'm 18. But the thing which stopped me to rate it 5 stars is that without premium I can only take 2 challenges at a time. When I tried third, my first challenge streak disappeared. Secondly, nearly all of the lessons and videos are featured. One can benefit own self in a limited way. But I highly recommend this app for premium users"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a lot of much fabulous.its a fantastic app and i suggest you all to join this app to make your life worthy.But there is one thing that no one can change you untill you'll try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how I have an amazing schedule now because of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many notifications and distractions"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It seems like a nice app and I would have wanted a subscription and to try it out, but paying for a full year ahead of a time before knowing what Im paying for, feels unreliable and it is. It gives a free week with most functions locked so theres not much to try. So yes, the app *seems* nice, but thats just an impression. Is the app any good, helpfull, usefull, likable? Cant know, most things are locked and its asking for a full subscription of 79$ annually."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is encouraging you to improve and bring wellness into your life but its so discouraging whenever the popup ad comes up, i literally cant do anything besides setting my goals. It has relatively good tips and is very though out, however i cant do anything unless i pay money for it. Maybe try not to take advantage of others vulnerability for money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"PREDATORY! Tried to cancel during trial period but subscription wasn't showing up on my acct so I spent 30 min on chat with Play Store help. They assured me it was cancelled but guess what? Today I was charged the FULL PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION COST! And it STILL doesn't show on my Play account! THIS IS HOW THEY TRICK YOU! There is NO customer service email or phone only a contact form (which I submitted 3x). They reply here saying to contact them but NEVER respond when you do. BEWARE!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app has been phenomenal. I haven't been using it for very long. Not even a week, but even at this point I am seeing changes and improvements in my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Really like some parts of the app, very cute, calming, good advice, but 50% of the interactions ive had with it so far is ""would you like to pay $80 a year to be able to add gratefulness to your morning routine??"" Or other such ""offers"" to get me to buy premium. Ill probably use this more for ideas and then like. Make a checklist of what I Really want in my routines in my notes app. Also I specifically asked for no 'fabulous' emails, and have gotten 3 in the last 12 hours. Ugh."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, daily reminders - very helpful for making changes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great apps!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me alot.thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy and lovely aproach. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Absolute scammers!!! After taking the first payment for the whole year I ran to cancel my subscription online.did it successfully as I got a confirmation however two weeks later they charged me the full price for the whole year AGAIN! SO NOW IVE PAID OVER ¬£70 FOR THIS STUPID APP THAT IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING. I can't contact anyone as they don't have customer service email. Absolute thieves."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its only been 3 days and so far I am loving this app. I look for to checking off my progress. This app is amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the app. I tried recommending it to others because it kinda helps my phone addiction üòÇ. Though I don't really understand some features in it, but it good to see other users (in different groups?‚òπÔ∏è) that post their pictures about their progresses of becoming better ... Really motivatingüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The premium is very forceful with a very manipulative message from ""future you"", I understand and would love to pay for your hard work but a donation system would be far more kind, I'm not well off enough financially to afford the yearly asking price at this time, nor do I appreciate the message it's sending, using my name to target me directly. Can't do much without the premium either so it's unfortunately just a water reminder right now which I can already get for free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great appüî•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"üòî I'm so sad... Why do the best apps have to be paid... My parents don't allow such apps and sometimes i really need guidance in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription but they keep charging me! Beware!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a good app, well planned oit and great options but the fact it's going to make me pay to set specific goals to ACTUALLY better my mental health does not help to better anything. I can't even add ""emotional check-up"" without having to pay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I was excited to use this app, it looked great and held such promise... but then I saw that I was charged immediately - no free trial period - and couldn't find a way to cancel and get my money back, no way to contact anybody not even after searching the internet. Granted this was a number of years ago but it was upsetting thetefore giving it two stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"More than interesting believe if you are looking forward to change your habit download this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I haven't been using The Fabulous for very long, but so far I love it. The only thing I really wish is that I could go back and listen to daily coaching sessions again, but I think that might be something the developers will implement in the future. For now, though, I love the pace. They're all about slow and steady wins the race... because it does! Fabulous focuses on building small habits, little bits at a time, and doesn't move on until you're settled in these small habits. 11/10 recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Confusing app design, no way to manage notifications, no way to manage subscription from the app, and the desktop version is broken and cannot be logged into either. I tried to cancel and got charged $40 for a purchase I didn't even want to make after the trial period. Not impressed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is Very goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nowhere when installing and going through the initial settings does it say this is a paid app. Only when you've set all goals etc. it won't let you continue until you pay. I just wasted my time and got needlessly excited thinking it was free. This is horribly misleading and manipulative. I wouldn't want a ""be your better self"" app from creators who are so obviously manipulative."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great but it won't cancel my subscription keeps trying to take my money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't had a real routine in years. I feel so proud of myself for being able to do this but kinda mad that it had to come from an app lol. But nevertheless I am so much more productive than I was."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. But some of the notifications can be overbearing. But all in all I would still recommend it to get yourself on a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled before the end of the free trial, according to their emailed instructions, and they still charged my account. It was a bombardment of alerts and messages. Not Fabulous experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best habit building app I've ever used, and I've tried a LOT. It teaches you how to make it easy to change your behaviors, and it's honestly made a huge improvement in my life. I think this is the best habit app for people who struggle with mental illness or disorders, like ADHD or depression. It's very gentle and doesn't ""punish"" you for falling off track. The one thing I wish is that there were more mods to ask for advice about the routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not do it the option to cancel doesn't pop up until you've been charged and you can't reimburse so now I'm put 40 dollars for an app that is awful its definitely a scam bc you pay and don't even get premium I'm pretty sure you have to pay more absolutely not ...... reply I've been trying to report and get refund and it doesn't even let you upload the documents it won't let me cancel the app is absolutely flawed... I feel like it's definitely a scam and I am looking into reporting it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app helps me to get started in the morning's and olso got me to eat breakfast in the morning's thanks FabulousüòÅüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware! Scam about the charges! I tried the one week trial period, i unsubscribed after 3 days, and they still tried to charge me for the annualy subscription after 7 days. Luckly, the payment was declined for suspicious activity, i contacted the bank and they knew about those kinds of scams and were very helpful. But i strongly suggest to read the real reviews about the same issue before giving them the bank details! I've lost a few hours of my day to fix this problem! Not so healthy habit..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The prescribed habits are habits I am already doing. There is no way to choose your own habits. The best part are the daily meditations. But even they have gotten boring. I paid for an annual subscription in April, went in to make sure that I didn't get charged again and canceled my account - because I forgot to cancel before the 7 day trial ended. Now they have ended my membership. It should have lasted a whole year. Very disappointed. Reply: did that, all I get is a form that leads nowhere."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really productive and really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for focus"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good, have to remind yourself that you chose to make the change so expect reminders and time needed to read and get involved"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very nice app.It does worth the money of the subscription.It just takes sometime till you get used to navigate it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seems like useful app but everything is hidden behind the pay wall so not much use when free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect. Love you all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just wanted a daily reminder and it asks all this personal information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really interesting content and great little plans to start off with. Minus one star as usability can be a bit confusing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"CAREFUL! THESE PEOPLE WILL CHARGE YOU DESPITE YOU TELLING THEM YOU WANT TO CANCEL! I have now been charged 34.99 because the cancellation link didn't work. I informed Fabulous help desk about this but nothing but repeated ""Go to cancellation link, it's easy"". Full of platitudes and impossible to cancel. I find the app messy and the layout incomprehensible, there is no clarity of the overall strategy beyond the oft repeated ""one little step at a time"" chant."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Lots to explore, still new to it. So still working out how it all works. But liking what I've seen so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üëè helped me get into a daily routine and a rewarding journey ‚ú®Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The pricing is deceptive. It indicates that the annual subscription cost is INR 79.99. However, once the trial package is activated, the page indicates that USD 79.99 will be charged after the trial period. There is no way to contact the fabulous team. Consequently cancelling subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"i hate this up, they charge me for whole year. and i cant refund my money. it didnt help so i uninstall but they still charge my bank account -_-"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very smooth and easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app and programs for self healing and improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helpfull app, can change the personality of human."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for the 7 day trial, and got an email to activate a 30 day pass. Activated it, to try for a month before deciding to go ahead with it. I got charged after 7 days despite the new billing saying that I'll only be charged in July (after the 30 day pass), and I was charged for a whole year's subscription. Immediately requested for a reimbursement and NO REPLY TILL TODAY. This is misinformation and unfair."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried to cancel this app before the free trial ended, so I don't know why I got charged, let alone twice. I've contacted them for help twice so far weeks ago with no response even though the first time was immediate. My bank account went negative because of them and they won't even answer me. I don't recommend this app anymore and I'm never coming back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Better than others like it. The Fabulous app is intuitively designed, enjoyable to use visually and mechanically, and practical verses hyped up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When I first started using the app, I thought it would be great to help me get myself on track. But after awhile, all the notifications became annoying, & I didn't feel like any of it was helping me, especially the daily coaching sessions. Also, I signed up for a specific coaching session on connecting deeply w/ your home, but I found it confusing as to when it popped up & when it didn't. Even though I paid for year, I canceled my subscription & uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible app that charges $50/month without letting you cancel it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's disgusting enough to make unsubscriping as difficult as possible. It's abhorrent if after spending my afternoon figuring out how to you change me anyways. Don't touch this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam!! After my day 3 free day I said to stop my subscription!! They are trying to bill me & thankfully my credit card company called me & I told them I will not pay. I'm contacting Better Business Bureau!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Happy with it, helps me keep up with good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Didn't find the app helpful. They make it difficult to cancel if you make the mistake of signing up outside of the app store. If you want to try it, use it through the app store so you don't have to deal with their cancellation process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the most beautiful apps in the app store with potential to be a truly live changing app instead of just a time wasting entertainment application."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's nearly impossible to cancel the premium for this app. I guess they want to trick you into keep paying. You have to go online, scroll, scroll way down. Four pages later they FINALLY realize I don't want the subscription. Quit making it so hard to cancel our membership. If someone tries to cancel LET THEM. Don't act like you're entitled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The call to incremental and experimental consistency is one of the strong points of this app. I have enjoyed the content, coaching, and task tracking. Sometimes the progression from one journey to another is not fully intuitive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Christ knows I ADORE THIS APP ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I actually like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I find this help full with drinking water and just being mindful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app charged me with a yearly rate. I guess it must be yearly because of the amount, yet I could find no info on the app. It doesn't appear on the play store. There is no way to cancel it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's visually stunning. I didn't take to the app because I found all the constant affirmations overwhelming and intrusive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Nice ideas! But a very confusing app. I was overwhelmed by the complexity, you really have to read every piece of text on the screen (and there's a lot of it) to take the right actions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Have tried it for a few weeks and really like the habits and prompts. The pricing is confusing because I kept getting offers for the level I already have. And Support never responded. But the app itself I'm really enjoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Comprehensive app. At first it's a bit much but variety is the slice of life. Customize your experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really very helpful for setting goals and creating new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Updating from one star: the app itself is great and useful to help support people out of ruts. It's great for ADHD autistic people who need routine but struggle to maintain it. Had issues with payment but was resolved by customer service who are very helpful, just expect a longer delay because they are popular! When I have a job and some money I will definitely subscribe to Fabulous to support them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Taken money out of my account without my permission. When reinstall to sign in it is impossible. Absolute scam. Got a solicitor looking into getting my money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App should be named frustrating not fabulous is fabulous. Loved the 30 day trial so much I paid for a year membership. After I paid my status still appeared as free membership. Emailed for help. Received one reply with no useful information. Requested more help twice. No response. 4 days and hours spent trying to figure it out myself myself, Im out $39.99 later and I've now lost a month worth of my journey progress from trying to reinstallthe app. Feeling frustrated and ripped off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me be sustainable in my progress, small measurable changes. Would recommend to anyone With ND."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tiene que estar tambien en espa√±ol, por lo demas todo bien"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It seemed like a cool idea but it wasn't for me. Low stars for needlessly difficult process of canceling premium subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my sub and got billed anyways. Customer support is non-existent. Seems shady to me. Proceed at your own risk!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another person here to report how hard it is to cancel the trial. Nothing else about the app matters when it's so predatory. Why do I need to use a website to cancel an app subscription? It wouldn't even load the right pages on my phone - I had to use the desktop website."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps keep me focused and to build new habits. Exactly what I needed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! I ended up paying for the premium version but the basic version is definitely worth the download at least."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly this app popped up on a random game, I felt the urge to just download it and I litterally have had an awesome experience with it this past week. A wonderful app if you need to begin new habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"WAY more than just a habit tracking app! This is a full guide to personal change complete with tracking systems, training, coaching, and more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I used a 30 day trial code but I was still charged and because there is no human support I was not able to get a refund. Worst experience of my life, honestly caused me more stress than good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Accidental Yearly membership purchased so thought I should embrace the app seeing as it was already paid for right.?! :):) Seize the day ...... Really is a great app for supporting you in your quest to establish routines that you know will benefit you and your future self. Helps you focus on the small acheivable steps , reinforces the reward of achieving it and ensuring it is established into a habit. It helps makes these desired actions.., second nature and autonomous. Reccomend and many thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm living the positivity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever. Don't believe I subscribed by mistake for this and have to pay not to use it at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great I'm really enjoying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the way this app helps you develop the new habits you want in a way that eases you in and helps them embed into your life. I also really like the way it tells you stories and its graphic illustrations, although I found it a little odd at first I like that it is imaginative in that way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. I only really committed to start the app just about a week ago. I'm impressed. Now I'm challenging myself with the app's suggestions and more routines. Let's see how the Fabolous journey unfolds..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unable to manage premium membership within the app. Says I have to use the website but neglects to provide a link to said website. Charges me for a premium subscription I'm not using without warning me of upcoming charge. Where is the subscription in Google play?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unauthorized payment! It draws money from my bank account without proper authorization. I submitted a request regarding the issue - no response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app has been helping me keep myself in check, tysm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience so far, love the design/aesthetic of the app. Have tried similar apps in the past but this is the first with the quality and engagement that keeps me using it and experiencing concrete lifestyle changes. Thank you, Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was too far into this process when I discovered; this isn't free it's p2p so no thanks for the time waste from me. You have stretched the meaning of in app purchases surely. My suggestion would be to make it clearer on your enforced in app purchases before putting somebody through a pledge!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bad App i hate it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me for another year after I cancelled my sub. Ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!! I'll continue to keep using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a cute app, but kind of frustrating if you want to just knock things out of the way. It's very beautiful and clearly a lot thought and effort went in to the making of it but it's not user friendly and it's difficult to navigate. I used the free version and tried a free 3 month trial, but I was charged before the 3 months were up. There were no notifications about a charge and you can't manage premium in app and the website is equally difficult to navigate for a refund which is sketchy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Have a really hard time jumping right into things and going 0 or 100. This is a good balance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"How do I unsubscrube?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"All though some features are locked behind a paywall the free things that the app offers have helped me a lot, especially during summer break"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS A SCAM!!! I signed up for the 30 day trial and then I was charged $63 but I received three emails in total that my payment was DECLINED. I cancelled my subscription and received email conformation. A WEEK LATER I HAD BEEN CHARGED ANOTHER $63 TO MY ACCOUNT. I am disgusted that there is no way to contact and I am disappointed that I have lost this money. I have now cancelled my card. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for the free trial and I would like my money back please. I canceled the membership before the payment date!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled before the end of my free trial, and I got email confirmation it was cancelled. They charged me $39.99 for a yearly subscription any way a week later. Now I have been waiting for days to hear back after filling out a refund form where they say it can take 10 days to get back to you. TOTAL SCAM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beat app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most motivated app ive come across constantly reminding me to be the better version on myself and helps me stay focused on the little task i have to do on the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good And helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"While you are on the free trial it is easy to add routines and habits. It is a bit harder to add them later without the premium membership. A way is to make a challenge which allows you to add habits to that challenge, up to 4 without the premium. You cant personalize your habits outside of the suggested ones without the premium membership so I would advise to add all the habits you can while on the free trial. Apart from that great and useful app!! It really helped me to develop healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Well designed üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Most stuff are pro features yet some of us our countries haven't reached there"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unable to customize what I want"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've achieved so much since installing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Already making so much progress and it's not even been 1 month üò≠"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My favorite app besides the app that allowed me to get this app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app appears to be built on good self help advice that helps people build positive habitats however the delivery is like fingers down a chalkboard. It is hyper feminine. It's very soft toned. It has no repect for work hours or any kind of reasonable schedule outside of wake up/sleep/weekends/shift workers. The daily letters come a day late in Australia. The motivational lectures bore me instead of pump up and inspire me. Now 2 stars for manipulative marketing campaign and exit emails."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really helping me reach healthy goals for myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is surely a fabulous app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unable to download. Sucks from the download stage looks like it's bugged throughout so I won't bother."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cluttered UI/UX with way too many suggestions, popups, letters, motivators and nudges to buy a subscription. Just a habit tracker/reminder with a backlog of ""suggested"" habits/journeys would be enough. I suggest you nudge people to buy subscription after they have used the app for a while and saw the benefits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I changed to monthly plan and I am so happy‚ù§Ô∏è I am back to fabulous and I am ready to rock my lifeüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is a great movement and wake me up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the emphasis on small goals. It's so achievable and easy to stick and before I knew I was implementing it in other areas of my life because it felt so natural. Cannot recommend enough and truly worth the cost."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app keeps me motivated. Well done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The good things: guided suggestions to set up healthy routines are on point. The letters explaining why new habits help are useful. The bad things: Needs better customisable options. The idea that doing a thing for three days has established a habit is laughable. The coaching and motivation segments are too focused on positive thinking and make you feel weak or failing if you have limitations like health conditions. Forces you into signing up for a paid plan and hard to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! 10 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping me focus on important things and gain confidence"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am giving it 4 stars because I just started using it. I like the easy goals you can accomplish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just set alarms app has nothing worth paying for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have Great expectation on this application its give me peace when i read about how im gonna be successfull one day great job . I saw it on Ad and its a great choice . Thank you fabulous ‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had an issue with the app and payment but the customer service resolved it promptly. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Working pretty well for the first couple of days. Will update if opinion changes üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. I even paid for a year membership. I look forward to the small changes that I'm making. I'm going to be amazing in a year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Tgis app is amazing and recommend tuis for you Helps with all your changes and makes you feel like you are special and unique. Five stars welldone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app really helps you to be productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I unsubscribed and uninstalled, but they are continuing to try to change me!!!! I contacted via the form, no response!! I NEED MY MONEY BACK ASAP, this is a scam!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the experience. It is subtly nudging me towards good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I have been trying for years to make healthy positive changes in myself and my life. I suffer ptsd and lack of self love so I get overwhelmed easy and giveup. This app makes everything simple and organized with a perfect combination of inspiration and common sense to help create healthy insight. Wish I had discovered it sooner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I only gave it one star cause I couldn't give it zero. I did enjoy the app but after canceling my subscription 2 mo the ago they charged my card for my subscription. These devices do not practice business ethically. They stole my money do not enter any card info here they will keep your info on file after you cancel and pester you for payment I got declined notices twice a week until they took my money for a canceled subscription. Currently back and forth with their support about getting money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The amount of hard selling you guys do is insane. I had already signed up for premium, ¬£0.99 for 2 weeks and then ¬£35 monthly afterwards. Between signing up for that last night you have sent me 4 emails trying to hard sell me on something I had already bought, this is nuts. If you guys can't figure out the behavioral science of spamming paying users, how can I trust your psychology and behavioral knowledge to be the best for me? Cancelled and uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a great help for my change, I completely recommend fabulous to anyone who's looking for their better self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Hi I wanted to upgrade however I am seeing two amounts. R79 per year and before entering my card details, it's Usd79. Please clarify. I would hate to purchase now and get debited with unknown amounts at a later stage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I found this very helpful. But I wish I could have more notifications with custom souds (I need something to really kick me to move). Art in this app is amazing, love it so much! Some kind of widgets just for reminding me would be amazing finishing touch. üåº"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing way to logout"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've never seen anything quite like this. It's amazing..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Got this app on a whim. Has really helped me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only a few days and I love it since its easy doesn't force into anything and makes me feel like achieved something everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like it, great for reminding you to do things and good for making habits, but you can only do some of the things from the app as most of it is premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Day 1 works pretty good so far would love if we got a full 2 years free but small things such as adding friends was what cost money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One week in and finding the app useful and helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not install the app - you will be scammed out of your money either by PayPal authorization or by auto renewing subscription (you will be charged before the end of your ""free"" trial), you may also get double charged. The app itself is not good, basically a glorified todo list with neverending barrage of ""motivational"" cringe. Do not waste time and your money, which is also impossible to get refund for from these people, I only got reimbursed by contacting PayPal directly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't use your credit card with this. Big bold warning. The free trial is just a scam because you will end with a $70 charge later. After answering a bunch of question all i was told was to drink water in the morning.. seriously!? I don't think the question matters anyway. This is marketing and money grubbing at its finest. I wish i had read the other reviews first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too pretentious, too opinionated, too patronizing, does not let me edit anything easily. over the top, pretentious slow animations at every step tooting their own horn instead of letting me navigate easily and customize"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why was I charged 39.99? The app is the same."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had canceled, and I was still charged, regardless to say dooky balls"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Soooooo many notifications, signed up for the free trial, and couldn't stop it. So 1 year of an app telling me to drink water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Now that I finally understand and am fully enthusiastic about going from a life of no routine and mayhem, I am so happy I stumbled upon this, which made me realize I don't have to engineer a routine alone, and expert and tailored techniques are to help me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the accountability it provides me and the motivation. It is really helping me to get on track with so many thingsüòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Make me feel better!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I canceled free membership 7 days in advanced but my card was still charged. Nice app though. continued using app premium features. Enjoyed the app while i waited for response for initial issue. Now the app just has a white screen. Has sound for notifications but nothing shows up when open app. üòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM...I cancelled before the free trial was up and I was charged for the year anyway. I didn't realize right away (earlier this month), but now that I tried to get my money back, it's saying I didn't cancel on time. Plus the contact us is easily found (I saw it as a reply for a similar complaint) and it's all computer generated so I couldn't get people to help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app didn't help me like it said. Terribly disappointed at it. It sends me emails even after I said I didn't want them and it's still sending me them after I uninstalled it. I thought apps don't send you emails if you say you don't want it. Fix this please."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Phone freezes every time I open it and I started getting a ton of spam texts the same day I installed it. I'm uninstalling and telling everyone I know what happened."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Content offered is not worth the ¬£35 PER MONTH! System is dependent on tricking becuase all the content on the app is not worth more than ¬£10 MAYBE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes forming good habits fun"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Habits are the things which define who you are and what you will become if you continue to have certain sort of habits.

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So many error, after write my profile the screen went black, and i have restart the app. After restart the app i have to answer some questions, but your background didn't show up, and the text use white color so i can't read the questions.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sofar so good, I've only done one day so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Giving this app a 4 star. Might change later to 5."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a little hard to figure out how it all works, but it's an encouraging way to grow yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great experience so far It takes little steps that help you to be consistent un changing your life little by little."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"BEWARE DON'T EVEN TRY THE FREE TRAIL THEY WILL CHARGE YOU EVEN IF YOU CANCEL. THE FREE TRIAL ONLY LOCKS IN YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION. HUGE FRAUDULENT APP. The website finally contacted me asked me 3 questions and denied a refund. I answered wrongfully charged and without any explanation of the change, they denied the refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a fraud. The Fabulous keeps charging my credit card various amounts even though I have made no in-app purchases. When I try to cancel my subscription in the app, it says I have to do it via the Google Play Store, but Google has no record of my subscription. There is no way to cancel my subscription, the app just keeps me running in circles. I am contacting my bank to charge back all credit card charges. The Fabulous: Shove this app up your arse!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. The free version is cool too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a useless app. Such a time waste. Useless animations, unnecessary loading. I wanted to use it to save time, not waste it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for a procastinating person like me!Started reading 3 pages of book everyday"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not free. Wish apps like these would simply charge at the beginning so that we don't get our hopes up and then run into a pay wall. Way to do the complete opposite of what ur app claims. Just another thing i can't afford. And more negativity..... thanks for nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Haven't even paid yet and it's helping me just stay consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HOW DO I UNSUBSCRIBE? I DELEYED THE APP BEFORE MY 7 DAY FREE TRIAL ENDED AND YOU TRIED TO TAKE $63 FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It makes you feel good and refreshed to start off the day and it keeps you busy throughout the day and night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Offers an array of habits that increase wellness and productivity."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good apps to get good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam alert, do not install! During the so called trial period I attempted to reverse the paid account, and I thought I had. Wouldn't you know a week later I am hit with a nonrefundable charge, and google play does not recognize my purchase. Evil scammers, do not download!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i LoVe It."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to follow yours activities an doing habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very smooth, easy to lesten to and the prompt are gentle."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just charged $39.99 don't know what for...never heard of this site. Can't find number to call and complain. What should I be getting for $39.99?? I am 71 yo..don't want to upset the status quo... $39.99 is a lot of money for me!!! Can I get a refund?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing more than bait and switch. One star is far too generous. NYTIMES approval should be a red flag for anyone..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is amazing I live and already feel better after a few weeks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Genuinely poor UI/UX, and an apparent attempt to discourage users from contacting support. The journeys are honestly great, but this app truly has one of the worst UIs on the market. You're forced to answer about a dozen questions when you launch, as it doesn't allow you to login without completing the new user intro, and the popups are intentionally non-closable. I was charged twice, and one of these non-closable prompts came up whilst trying to contact support, taking a few minutes to finish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A unique approach to self-improvement that won't let you give up easily. Encouragement and positive outlooks are built into the program. We'll worth the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good but it would be better if you could go to the previous day and check the boxes if you did the things but forgot to acknowledge them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"can we use this app free or it take chagersüëÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love this app and recently purchased a premium subscription on the website but it's not showing in my app. I've done all the troubleshooting and sent 3 help requests with no response at all. Very disappointed. Update: I just submitted a service request via the website. We shall see if I actually get a response. Update 2: I received an email, but it just mentioned a refund, not actually linking my account to my subscription. I've emailed back twice now asking for that and no response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had to get a new phone because my old was failing and I had just set this up on my old phone a few days ago. Turns out, I can't transfer data without premium and I won't pay for a feature that most apps do when you sign in. I am uninstalling and annoyed over the wasted time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am being charged for a membership I canceled over a year ago through the actual company. I got the subscription through google so when I canceled I of course didnt expect a charge. The charge put my account into negative. Their website keeps rerouting me to their online way of canceling, but my app doesn't even show a subscription to cancel. I need to speak to an actual employee to take of this, but there is no contact number. I would never get a subscription from this app if I were you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not personalised and it says it is. It doesn't ask where you actually need change. I find it annoying that i get reminders for things i already did anyways along with what i want to. and then still not in ways I need. This one size fits all approach to self improvement is not working. On top of that the when i gave feedback the staff was extremely rude and unprofessional."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have used this app before, and felt amazing change. At first, I thought it was odd that it prompted me to start with a morning routine; it seemed to have morning to do with my goal. But it made a huge difference! That sorry little routine changed my whole mindset for the day. I felt noticably different when I would skip that routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app to get rid of bad habits and get the new ones going to get fit and stay healthy and to stay productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only been using a short time but already I can feel myself relaxing into a new way of being me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Effective üòª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes my transformation journey so easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous for vacation because I usually wake up at 11 so I'm feeling really tired, don't drink enough water and don't make an amazing breakfast to start my day but this app is coaching me and I'm feeling way less tired! Thanks!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simple and encouraging üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It helps you to focus on what's important to you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self improvement"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Hi I have unsubscribed the app before its renewal, but why the app renewed again and I‚Äôm being charged again? Please advise and assist."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A little too much functionality spent on trying to sell premium. I don't have a problem for paying for extra services. Fun extra features are great and good motivators. However, this app has cut/limited some of the core services to sell the premium version. This has been my day one experience so take that into perspective."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app the only thing I don't like I the subscription but you guys have to give it a try"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far, I am loving it. I think this is a perfect way to get myself back on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Better the 2nd time. I tried the app last yr and I don't know if it was because I was not ready or I was lazy but it didn't last long. Now, I feel better and I can't wait to continue to receive challenge. The layout and the motivation is all there. It is so simple to use and I truly believe it has saved me a ton in free therapy! So there's that. I feel better and I look forward towards my future üòå ‚ò∫Ô∏è üôè ‚ú®Ô∏è I just wish they had more routines/being able to make your own."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Too many notifications, started off nice but has become a source of anxiety. Also the refund process is a real headache compared to other apps. I submitted a request the exact same day I was charged, but it is unclear if my request will be honored as I have not received any communication."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Effective because it holds you accountable and motivates you with thought-out graphics and quick articles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Their website makes it very difficult to cancel accounts or payments. I removed my card and canceled my membership on the 8th and they still were able to charge me today. The app has only basic features available unless you pay $40. Ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like having my own personal coach, love Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I've been using Fabulous for a week, and I do like it - but a couple things are problematic for me. One, inability to set your own 24hr cycle. Not everyone is diurnal, lots of people work nights, but if your day is split between ""today"" and ""yesterday"" things get screwy or cut in half. Second, I know the idea behind being unable to UNcheck something is motivation to do it, but what if it's something you can't do anymore? It messes up mastery, especially if you shake or have thick fingers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The service is the worst. I tried contacting support team but all you get is automated responses both on the app and emails. It's been 6 days since I requested my refund and no feedback"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its quite hard to cancel your subscription. Personally think it may help but you need to be on it all the time, its gonna take over your life. Maybe for the better? Not for me tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well layed out and easy to manage. You do still need your own motivation and determination though. Not sure why people think apps can do it all for them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app looks cool but if you work shifts or have any flexibility in your routine it is completely useless. Would be nice to set wake up time daily and have the same goals built from there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far great It's making be more productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great overall Life routine app to keep you accountable!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"ive been at this for one week and like the small goal approach, i feel like i have accomplished something meaningful and made progress, but without overwhelming me. And the style on how you can start small and grow is exciting. The pace has truly helped me not quit! I would tone down on how frequently it asks me to take on a new challenge, its only been a week and still trying to find a good grove. but over i like it :D"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fraud. Signed up for the 50% off deal. Got charged the full amount so cancelled straight away and emailed for a refund. Got told to go to support on the app. Go there and it is a blank page. Tried on multiple devices, just a blank page. Tries their online help centre, again on multiple devices, and it just keeps saying that it needs to verify my browser. And now I get harassed asking me to sign up again. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a good app but it was not for me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Little or no warning of charges after the end of your premium trial. Cost me over $40 for something I didn't want. No thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Extremely prescriptive. Not a habit tracker. Almost immediately makes you sign up. Best for people who are clueless about how to improve their lives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app it's so amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Real great! Very good at taking it slow and teaching an aggregate of marginal gains."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"inspirational app lots of pleasant surprises along the wayüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ther are no answers in ""Contact Us"". Help me please, more than 10 days ago I requested a refund and don't have answer yet. I need that funds urgently"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best mindfulness app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most useful app in my hole life, because of this app my life is so easy now its all planned and all,but i would love if the. morning routine and the afternoon routine and the evening routine. Had more spots to put more habits in. That's all but this app is still 5 stars."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes it a simple process to build habits. But remember that trying to do all the habits you want to have simultaneously is to sudden for your mind and body. Take your time, and with patience comes results."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience helps with procrastination thank you fabulous for doing a fabulous job."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You see a change when your first challenge is completed && it's only a 3 Day challenge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good..Going to give it my best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im slowly developing good habits. Feels like I have a friend giving me advice. Pleasant graphics and sound tips."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I go through all the steps only to hit a pay wall. I add routines... only to hit a pay wall after 3 tasks for each routine. Seriously? Who only has 3 tasks to do in their work day? I thought about signing up for the premium to try for one month but that's not an option. If I knew for certain that I wouldn't be charged upfront for the entire year, I would try it but the security of putting in my CC info right away makes me leary."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice üëåüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far its been super encouraging and helped me take small steps to my goals with no loud adds or spam notifications. Will update later in my journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience. It is too hard to cancel the subscription. Still can not find a way to cancel it. Do not recommend it at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the free Fabulous plan for a 30 day month trial and unsubscribed it on the 2nd of June 2022. However, I was charged for the annual subscription on the 9th June despite cancellation of the subscription. I received an email stating that the app will be free till 2nd July but I was charged early on 9th June despite the cancellation. Requested for refund through multiple channels (Refund request form, email, Twitter, Instagram etc) but got no reply. Please reverse the charges.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app! I just downloaded it the other day, but it's already working. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because some stuff requires a membership/premium, which I am not able to use. But other than that, Fabulous is amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"worth gold for the coaching and habit building structure."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily complicated for a beginner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have never been so overwhelmed by an app before and I've played gacha games. It dumps a lot of various resources on you without giving much thought to what the user wants or individually needs. I wanted to use this app to manage my OCD but It has its own idea what your routine should be and trying to make changes is unnecessarily frustrating. Also it really tries to persuade you into taking their free trial and after seeing the reviews I am so glad I just uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful without being pushy. I've developed habits that will last a lifetime. The encouragement is terrific."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helped to get me started on discipline based tasks so I could get out of a really bad OCD episode."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Thus far experience has been fruitful. Excited to see how it impacts me, moving foward."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"06/29/16: This app has helped me in so many ways. Not only is it encouraging and inspirational but it's educational and all their suggestions are supported by credible sources. I love this app and thank you so much to the creators. Its clear that this was designed to truly help people, not make a buck. It's so amazing though, I wouldn't mind paying for it at all. EDIT on 6/11/22: I still absolutely LOVE this app and love the new additions they've made to it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeping on track & helping me focus better to be in the moment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth the patience, love and kindness. The same one that you're worthy of. If you want to change your life, these are great baby steps to start. Give yourself an opportunity to try"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the idea behind this app, and I found the habit tracking to be helpful. I wish there were more instruction regarding how to best use it, but I'm only a week in, so maybe that will come. Edit: one thing I'm put off by a week in is the pressure to share the app with someone else - I recommend apps to others often, but the reminders to do so have the opposite effect."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like this app but when I have the app open or the chat bubble on my screen the bottom section of my screen does not work. Today I tried to open chrome which is at the bottom of my screen even after closing the app it still wouldn't let me open chrome so I finally deleted the fabulous app and everything started working again. I have a samsung S21."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only a couple weeks in, but Fabulous is making a difference in my life. I have chronic pain and mobility issues, and it's always been really hard to find motivation to get active. I was honestly dreading the exercise portion of the routine when I first started, but Fabulous framed it in a simple way, it doesn't dictate how I move, or worry about mile and calories. It helps me celebrate when I move every morning even in small ways, and that is huge for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Completely took over my phone! Tried to quit, unsubscribe, delete, uninstall. Dont bother. If I could rate and give zero I would."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it helped me a lot and it is filld with amazing challenges."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel like a new person this changed my life i am now calm and my days are in order so i would like to say thank you for changing my life in a good way üòÅüëçüíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I was off to a good start. Unfortunately I had to reinstall the app and I was not able to log back in and recover my progress. Luckily I was still in the trial period, so I could cancel my subscription. It is also quite inconvenient that you are not able to use the play store for payments."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Number 1, research - based recommendations."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is amazing so far, that i've used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceling the premium subscription has been a nightmare. The app is way too busy to be productive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted to test the app over a reasonable time frame see if it was any good. You want my card and a commitment to pay $60 in 7 days. Greedy. Must not be too sure about my outcome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not all content in the screen is displayed, seems there was a question and multiple choice options, but I can only see the options. The same with other screens, only part of the screen/text is displayed. Update: Weirdly the content/text issue is fixed when I switched my phone to Dark mode. üòÖ I'm enjoying the app so far, small goals are very achievable and rewarding ‚òÜ*:. o(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)o .:*‚òÜ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I just got charged three times on the same day for this app. I can't find any contact info to reach anyone?! Can someone please help??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The habits are great and achievable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Aplikasi yang bagus, tapi harganya cukup mahal..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app 10/10 recommend if your the type to person to procrastinate or get motivation from checking things of a list"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is the least user friendly, most confusing app I've ever used. The Home screen is confusing; the challenges are confusing; the notifications are confusing; the emails are confusing; the website is confusing; the plan options are confusing; the cancelation process is confusing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good I think the big thing is that I just need to continue to maintain my progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I've tried the app and don't like it for several reasons. It's too fufu. Another reason is the app is very busy and not very clear. Lastly, there's incorrect information mixed with some good information. One example is the app tries to make it a habit for you to eat in the mornings even when you're not hungry. That's how people get fat; they eat when they're not hungry and this app actually tries to program you to do just that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of subscription based mental wellness apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great for building a consistent routine, wish it was free :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware they will charge you for a year mid free trial and you can't get a direct connection to customer service or call. Update the response I got today from the developer is bull. I have a bunch of emails and proof I cancelled that disputes this . I was looking back through the reviews on the same issue It's almost the exact same thing i am going through in most of them and the developer response is like the generic run around emails you get when you cancel before your trial is up the charge u."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Currently on Day 4 but I already like the materials they are providing along with the statistics from studies to show how these habits have success. Will update after more time passes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encouraging fun app with nice reminders"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping me build great habits and routines one day at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled the subscription and it is so difficult to contact the customer service for refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged after I cancelled my subscription and have no way to remedy this just to prewarn you if you subscribe with the ¬£1 offer and cancel straight away they will go onto charge you for the annual subscription. I've already done that. I'll await your reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Messy app, less configurable what I expected. Not possible to delete account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app charged my card without confirming a subscription or notifying of the end of a 30 day trial period. I want to cancel, but it tells me to go through google play store (where i downloaded the app from), and the google play store has no record of a subscription. You've replied to my review, but not my emails. You don't make the unsubscibe process straightforward. My card details didn't even confirm so I wasn't even aware I was going to be billed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just starting out, but it's been helpful so far. I like how it builds of small success. Even if you know to do that, it's more motivational when you have coaching. I'd love to be able to poke around more, though. I came to the app because there was a ""find your best productive schedule"" quizz link and it's no where to be found."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have never had a intentional habit stick this long. It's a good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Accidentally put the wrong name in and I can't change it. Glad I didn't pay yet, because that's annoying Don't want to use the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app forever I have no words to describe....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give a zero. The app was cumbersome and not easy to use so I deleted it off my phone and never used it. When I cancelled the subscription for the next cycle, they still charged me for a payment cycle that I would not be using. Terrible business model. Worse costumer service ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This made me very productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will charge you for trial and will refuse refund. I am coming back to update my review and I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the same. Beware that if you register for a free trial they might as well charge you and then refuse a refund. Install this app only if you are sure u want to subscribe and use. Terrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's awesome! I just opened it and it already makes me feel better! The only bad thing I have to say os that you can choose just 4habits per routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Look, the app is good. But they don't allow you to cancel your free trial in the actual app, or even through Google Play, you have to go to their website, which is crazy. So I'm out $55 for bad poetry cutscenes, and I am super annoyed. They also don't respond if you contact them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üòòüòòüòòüòòüôè love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Fix the pricing in the Philippines it says 39.99 Php per year which equates to less than a dollar but when you're actually buying it, it shows 39.99$ which is roughly 2000 Php idk man kinda dissapointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been very helpful and it definitely does a great job at keeping you consistent."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have been able to stick to a self care routine üôè‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like a story that opens new pages after you succeed in each goal you select. It's entertaining, and at your own pace"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thought it was free...Duke University doesn't need my 40$"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Through Fabulous, I have learnt that how even after years of bad habits, depression and lack of motivation that through incremental small,sometimes miniscule steps I can change myself and my life for the better. Fabulous and it's community is like nothing else I have come across, ever. I was extremely lonely when I first found La Vie Fabuleuse, that's gone. I subscribed to Fabulous Premium, it's well worth the price, I have gained so much. Thank you Amber and the team. ‚ù£üå∏‚ù£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Five star or nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great to use, beautiful UI. Looks a bit hard to use but is great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Everything you need to improve yourself. I love the celebracions and milestones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"update 9.06.22 Well done to the customer support after much back and forth emails I got a refund and repurchased at $24usd annually. Hold out for their best offer which comes once you ignore the initial offers! I am still waiting for a response from fabulous after paying for a membership deal of $2 USD a month. They said give them 10 days to have everything sorted and I'm still waiting. The thing is i liked their product and want to continue but their follow-up care needs a heap of work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like it but I wish the full version was free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nightmare experience even starting. Not using."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"All good so far - helped me start some healthy habits already. Still really enjoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Follows along with my way of thinking. Helpful to stay accountable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, it gets you thinking, builds healthy habits and doesn't make you feel bad about yourself in the process. Hands down the best of it's kind!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried their premium free trial, but after about a week, decided it wasn't for me and cancelled. A few weeks later, I noticed transactions on my online banking showing that I'd been charged a year's worth of premium, twice on the same day! So they've taken ¬£70 off me for a service that I didn't even want. I contacted their support a week ago and haven't heard back, yet. Edit - 19 days later. Still no response to my support requests. Do not give these people your bank details."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Ffs, This app pissed me off a little. I already finished the task but the music and buzz is still on, can't find anything that will stop it. So I deleted the source itself (Fabolous) and thankfully it did stop. That thing got me having a panick attack for a second, especially when it's your exam today. Like- bro fix it. Other than that tho, the app itself is a good routine planner and have a good graphics, and poems or story whatev you call it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just learned about this app from Jessica McCabe's YouTube channel How To ADHD. I LOVE her content, and she has so much awesome insight on dealing with ADHD. She's someone I trust on the subject, so when she mentioned Fabulous on her channel, I had to try it out. One thing I noticed about Fabulous that stands out over all is that it has helped me with time management in a BIG way! People with ADHD have trouble with that, so, thank you to the developers and to Jessica! I'm loving Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I first tried this app in 2020, and didn't like it. My life coach recently recommended it to me to help me establish daily routines, so I thought I'd give it another shot. I didn't like the interface of it and wasn't motivated to use it. I could only sign up for it by putting in my card info for the free trial and then the yearly subscription after that. I unsubscribed before the free trial was up, but there was still an attempt to charge me for the yearly plan, but my card blocked it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent graphic and inspiring content. Well done!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've used Fabulous a few times now. It's something I try to keep & come back to for either extended periods or little boosts. I think the main function (habit builder) is what I may use the least. I'm obsessed with the coaching, challenges, journeys, & guided stuff. I would like to be able to do more of the habit stuff, but I'm more of a paper person so I tend to forget/neglect that aspect & haven't yet gotten into that side of the app yet. REALLY wish they had more Yoga stuff though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam. They send you around in circles and never let you cancel. Stay away from this app. I'm going to have to close accounts and cancel cards to get away from these con artists and thieves. Update- look at their response! Still no resolution. IT DOES NOT LET YOU CANCEL ON THE APP OR IN THE APP STORE. IT SENDS YOU IN CIRCLES!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The journeys aren't very flexible, if you make your own routines, they easily break with no obvious way to fix them. For example I moved exercise out of my morning routine into a weekly routine, and I was unable to make any progress. It's also constantly sending notifications, maybe 10 a day, each one asking you to read a long fluffy note and sometimes watch a video several minutes long that is again, pure fluff. Some people might like this, not for me. I was using the premium subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They are really trying more to help you than to take your money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"They picked some good sound effects. You can feel the science"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Where do you stop the morning alarm!!! It's driving me insane.i tried everything! Now I need to switch off the phone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good helps me get back on track with all my habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best choice made this year!!! Looking to oganize and be accountable..this app is it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for creating a routine. And I love how it takes 1 habit at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got billled even though I cancelled the subscription. Nice. 6/8/22 yet to hear back from customer service and NO refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total scam ... They Lul you in with a free trial, and include in very small print that after that it's $60 to continue your account. You can't use Google play to manage the subscription like any reputable app allows, and as others have said you cannot cancel the subscription in the app, and you cannot log into the website to do it there, they just keep bouncing you around. Very glad I used PayPal so I can just block their company from taking my money, whatever you do don't give them your CC#!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a very fun and motivational app for setting and achiveing goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The incredible encouragement I needed to target a number of my earnest goals ü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a scam they dont let you unsubscribe and they charge you money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it, but too sad I can't pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying this app very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's helping me change and incorporate small habits into my daily routine in such a way that it's not to overwhelming for me. I'm excited to add and complete my tasks, I like that there's a reminder to pace yourself as all better habits will come naturally so long as the foundation is set strong!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Really loved the aplication, meaning it. I absolute love everything about it is a great routine app, i wish it was free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For an app that claims to use behavioural science, there sure are a lot of spammy notifications that can't be turned off. I just wanted to fix my routine, and it worked at first, but then a swear the notifications got more and more spammy to the point where whenever I see a notification with the rocket icon, I automatically assume it's spam and cross it out. I can't believe that people who claim to understand behavioural science didn't see this coming!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am trying to get a refund, but it's not possible to upload a receipt in the app and there doesn't seem to be any other way to reach out to you. I had to go to the web version to upload the receipt."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it..... This app has been a great help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For me the app is way too instuctive. I prefer doing things on my own terms instead of having to read or listen from every single thing all the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! Being a list maker already its nice to be able to check off my daily goals and the coaching is always the pick me up or thought expanding topic I needed for the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app for the goals I want to do especially with the morning routine. The only thing I wish I could change is the clearness of the goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So good and fun app I just love this ü•∞üåà‚ú® it is productive and fun app but the bad thing is this is in free version it don't have that much features please add more in free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cash"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a pretty good app. I was skeptical that I needed it, as I'm pretty organized and figured I could make lists and follow them by myself. I struggle with depression and anxiety, and this app is a gentle reminder that you can dismiss but it'll come back to coax you onto the right path again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like you're app! It's great! Can you please give more detail in what is required? For instance 'squats' could have a game plan to follow attached to the habbit itself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app i found"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The free version is pretty good. But I bought the Premium version through paypal, and I did lose money but my account never upgraded. Furthermore I contactes their support team but I got 0 response. Do not pay for this app, you might just throw away your money. Edit: It has gotten even WORSE not only is their contact team not responding but today an additional 40 euros has been deducted through my paypal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to help you start a morning routine and to help you stop bad habits. It also is a motivational app to make you more excited to change your life to the better. Also, you can ask other fabulous users questions and answer theirs. I really like fabulous as it helped me shape a better me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Imma be real man.. it was just a cool looking app aesthetically and I used it solely for that LMFAO"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liking it üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Very helpful in getting my life back on track. I didn't know I had such a bad sugary food addiction until I tried the 2 day no sugar challenge. It was tough!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love IT"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app really enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it! I canceled my subscription twice and they still keep trying to take money. I doesn't give you an option to remove your card or even delete your account. Don't waste your time. I've emailed regarding the multiple transactions and no response! 0 stars!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's definitely fabulous ‚òÄÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted a refund because I couldn't really afford the subscription. With these ""self help"" apps, there's always an underlying gimmick. First I was told Google play needs to reimburse me, but someone name Nanu keeps emailing me like I'm lying about the $43.34 stolen from my account. It was stolen because the payment was NOT AUTHORIZED! I don't need to pay 43 to remind me to drink water, etc. I will forever trash talk this company because of the rotten values they have! Thou shalt not steal!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really like it except this conflict with a stock alarm (Samsung Galaxy S10+). Snoozing of the stock alarm is impossible while you haven't turn on the screen and turned off the Fabulous alarm. Other than that - awesome app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Vry goodüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Poor Customer Service! Poor handling of subscription cancellations!! I cant even get in touch with anybody for help. I cancelled my subscription in the beginning of May and they charged my bank account without permission! Their policy prevents you from receiving a refund even in these situations!! I warn you before you proceed to download and get a subscription because they only want your money! Do not install or give them your bank account info. Very disturbing! I have pictures of proof!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing an fabulous app XD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just love how it can help you through like literally everything you need help with so I recommend you get this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Little to no ads so far. Let's you go at your own pace, not too pushy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíïüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you clear your head of any negative thoughts you may have about this app, if you give it a chance, you will find that this app is a wonderful creation. Motivational and helps you throughout the whole day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am pretty new to this app but I thrive with structure and order. This app helps me maintain focus and teaches new skills and useful approaches to life. I am really glad I found this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"39.99, woow insane. Thanks for all those reviews, I dont buy it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Inspired, positive and motivated.. Ot remind me of my daily word and planner"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled before the end of the free trial. I didn't like that I couldn't skip the water drinking part because I already drink copious amounts of water and wanted to really get into changing the rest of my habits. Also, I noticed one of the ""journeys"" is Intermittent Fasting which is basically asking to induce an eating disorder and I think it's disgusting that would even be an option. It makes this app part of the multi-billion dollar diet industry which is deceptive and wrong. Just NO."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It feels like it's really gonna help me in the future. I am going through a very tough time in life right now and I keep waking up and just not wanting to be awake, but each time I look at this app and the notifications and go on it, it makes me feel slightly happier and motivated to do good with my day. Thank you Fabulous, you have been fabulous :) P.S. I've only had the app for 3 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App tracker blocked this app from collecting advertising and location data for third parties. The tracker blocker reports app tracking activity even when the app is not in use. Uninstalled for this reason. My free trial ended and I took advantage of the one year offer for the paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Although I am only 4 days in I am getting on well with the app. The visuals are beautiful and the challenges are tricky enough to feel like progress but easy enough to keep motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You are changing my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Offered free trial I followed instruction on the website And immediately I was charged over ¬£35 from my bank account. These guys are robbers. They Haven't even sent the invoice . They play so caring but in reality they look for vulnerable people to deceive them and make money on them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The Fabulous subscription doesn't appear in Google Play Store subscriptions, so unless you remember you were forced to accept a one year plan, you will be charged with 40‚Ç¨ after the 7 day trial. I expected to see everything in my Subscription plans in the Play Store."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, it's helped me create 2 new habits !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it very hard to stop the subscription payment. And when you go to ""manage subscription"" in settings it tells you to log in online. But then when you log in online they dont present an option to ""manage subscription"" . The program itself is pretty nifty but theyre shady when it comes to trying to end your payment proccess."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, so good..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really keeps you in check and has so many options and choices to truly help you create a healthier routine and to better yourself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app ,i don't have any complain regarding its function but only concern is subscription price , creator can you so something about it?i really wanna experience premium one!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I haven't had this for long, I wanted to have a better life style so i got it, I didnt realize how many bad reviews this got, and I certainly dont think people should pay for a better life style or mental health it's the same Walmart is cheap with more unhealthy stuff but whole foods is great for you but its richer, why do we have to pay more for stuff that makes us healthier? Disgusting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üåà‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüåπ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had to change my once unfavorable comment. This app has helped me tremendously. It helped me establish Rituals and great happens. I enjoy the Journey's and Challenges. Worth every penny. ...One Year Later and I'm still using the App. üòÅI completely restarted my Journey a week agoüìö to get out of my funk after having tragic events üò≠that took me from my Practice üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è , Now, I have more Zest and Zeal than Ever ü§© This App helps you be your Best üèÜ Self and grow everyday. Living My Dreams!!!üòù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really good not just bc it keeps track off all the things but also bc it's very inspiring."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bloated and certainly not worth any money. It is canned platitudes and tired sayings with corporate artwork . Generic motivational quote, and pretty much no customization in the coaching or plans. There is no option to say ""I already do that"", you just have to wait for it to be over to move on to something of value. Nothing is personalized, everyone is on the same journey. The bones of what they want you to do are good, but telling to me drink water and get sleep is not worth any dollar amount."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do you need my fingerprint? To sell on the dark web? Major red flag. Delete."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Some great things about this app, but there are a few problems. - It keeps kicking me out of my journeys! So the main feature of this app, guided self improvement, is buggy and unreliable. - There's no way I can find to add weekly or monthly tasks, only daily ones, so the function of this as a task management app is very limited. - I strongly dislike the big push into intermittent fasting that this app has. Intermittent fasting is not right for every body."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Literally do not download , in my country this is a lot of money & I cancled my free trial late because my son landed up in hospital . They still try to deduct the money from my account every month . I have emailed them begging them to not charge me as I haven't even got the app anymore . They still trying to get this month subscription from me . Ridiculous . I've got a son to take care of I can't afford this . Dont recommend it whatsover !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has definitely helped! Even without paying I have been getting stronger each day and remembering my goals! Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS A SCAM! Fabulous does not allow me to remove my credit card information from my account after my free trial. Don't download this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for a week and a half. At first I found the slow start frustrating, because I've struggled a long time to make permanent changes and wanted everything at once...but this app takes you by the hand and guides you through healthy ways to make small but permanent compounding changes. It makes each day an adventure, and encourages you to celebrate all your victories, no matter how small, so you maintain your momentum toward a better life, changing your perspective as you do so. <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a sweet experience! It's like someone really supportive and dear to your spirit is taking you by the hand. The stories are delightful and feel spiritual in nature. Really loved the app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Terribly annoying. For people like me who don't like having ""too much"" but just the essential, it's extremely annoying. I tried to follow the journey but couldn't stand all of those bullsh*ts and the audios popping out every time. I even disabled the voice coach but there's no way to create your own coach that suits you best... And I felt blasted by all of that colors and illustrations. Just too much of everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps you get there. Wherever your going. But you got to show up and keep going. Still up to you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful app, I feel better as every day goes by"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Feeling lost and unsure, with everyday being unfulfilling and arbitrary? Give FABULOUS a go. What have you got to lose? A+"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a scam. It automatically charges your card after the trial even if it's not on your Play Store subscription. They also made it extremely difficulty to unsubscribe since it's unlisted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the application so far. It sends the notifications at the right moment and keep them on top. I love the motivation and coach messages. I would like to see more habits like Skin Care in the routine as it is well known. Plus i am still discovering how i will add reminders for water for all the day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so good I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app, of course its for helping you to be better, won't make you better without any effort. But don't is job perfectly!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app has everything I need to help me better manage my time, tally my habits, and see my progress as each task is completed. Can't wait to feel real habit forming results. It's user friendly and easy to create my own desired habits, not just pre-existing ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is easy to use and I've made progress using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's cool. But a little confusing to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: i cancelled my dubscription, deleted my info and uninstalled the app and they still trying to charge my card. Can't opt out of premium. The app says to go to the website, the website says to contact customer service. I emailed them to cancel my subscription but got no response and they have been trying to take $40 for days. This was after my 7 day free trial. Luckily I didn't use my main card. This is how they trick people . They also tried to charge me before the 7 days were up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazingly helpful for those at rock bottom"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You go through all the questions then it tells you that you need to pay ¬£8 a month lol immediately uninstall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They stole my money. I canceled the free trial before the payment was due to pull out of my account. It didn't work. I tried contacting support but it's a robot with a form you ha e to fill out. It requires you to give proof but the issue with that is you can't upload a picture from your phone! I found an email to write to but I haven't heard back 43 dollars down the terrain that I couldn't afford to lose. This app should not be called Fabulous but Fraud instead."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's like a techy version of a journal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I wish there was a clear space outlined in the app to go back and reread daily motivations and rewatch the video stories that play in between accomplishing morning goals on journeys. The videos have stopped playing so I've missed almost a week of the storyline. And I see no place in settings to go back and review these items again. It would be nice to have as a motivating reminder. Thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"At first I was skeptical but I absolutely love this app now it gives me consistency and fulfillment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helped me alot I feel more energetic, positive and I started trying to eat breakfast consistently and it has been working I honestly like this app but I just started so my review may change later"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only one week free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for improving discipline."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like that you can make your own tasks and goals and i like the stories behind each goal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Far too complicated. Advertised as something different. Doesn't easily allow you to create your own habits suggests things based on questionaire you have to take. Not my cup of tea"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tries shoving a premium plan right down your throat the moment you install the app. As an alternative it doesn't offer a free plan, but rather a trial of the premium which results in paying a premium within a week. A contract you will be locked in for a year. The vulnerable person does not even know that the free plan exists, only after a decent amount of online searching you will find that there exists a free plan too. It is not clear what exactly the differences are between the plans."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app i love it and it's helping me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is annoying and it stole me $45. Dont even try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice experience up to this point. This point being one week of doing it. We'll see...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great transformation app and what I like is they start small with your transformation and even motivate you you to keep going thank you fabulous team keep doing the good work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Does have technical issue as my screen freeze for no reason. But I can cop it. üëç"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App. I didn't expect much from this but was pleasantly surprised how well this app helps with creating and sticking to healthy habits. I'm now drinking water every morning, eating a healthy breakfast and starting to get more active. This app is very helpful and I'm looking forward to keeping up with the new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought this app was free. It took me about 15 minutes to set up my profile then informed me it was only free for 7 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a worst app which bothers you to purchase their premium plan everytime. If you don't purchase their costly plan then there isn't anything you can ... without premium plan the app is totally waste of time. They had locked acess to everything."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has seriously helped me in my morning routine. I've always found it really hard to keep good habits but this app makes it so easy! I've now had a streak of drinking water, meditating, and saying self-affirmations for about two weeks now and I've seen a noticeable improvement in my mood!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A life coach in your pocket and others around the world sharing with you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"A little disorganized and not the easiest to use. Trying to figure out how to navigate through the app was causing me stress, discontinued membership because of this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just perfection that all it is perfection"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The yearly plan got renewed without prior intimation. I have opted for free trial on 9th May 2022 and the payment was initiated from my husband's credit card on 13th may 2022 itself. The payment was processed on 16th May 2022. Please cancel the plan immediately and process my refund. Edit: As suggested, I contacted support on thefabulous.co, but have not received any reply. Please cancel the plan immediately and process my refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very cute app so far! I love the graphics and I am seeing some differences in my habits already. I love how much they hold your hand through the process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to get more activities and you only get four activities without the premium and I don't have the money for it and it says it's for everyone but the lowest age is 16 and I'm not 16 so the confusing part for me and I don't see why I have to pay to have a ""fabulous life""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nope for me for sure üôÇüòäüôÇüòäüôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm really loving the app . It combines science study and logic and helps you break everything g down so it's not so overwhelming . Almost like ha ING a life coach in my pocket . Definitely love the app and can't wait to achieve more with this tool and learn more about this app ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Great to start healthy habits. Free month pass is definitely worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app is definitely visually appealing but it's frustrating. I wanted something to help me build a stronger routine at night and during the afternoon. It wanted to start me off slow with tasks I already do. I couldn't get the afternoon and evening routine to work almost like I had to unlock them. And it kept giving me alerts that my routine had too many things which was frustrating. The icing was that it wouldn't let me set up a backup or even a login. Do not recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Other than quotes from racist figures, I quite enjoy the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It has been a very aesthetically pleasing and motivating app so far üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just started and so far so good. The story is cute and motivational. The habits are pretty easy just making time for it is the hardest for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It takes really long for habits and the habits options is minimum, I give it 2 Star coz it provides a good check list that Is activated every day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slow steady changes and positive encouragement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Looks very good and is a fairly simple app, but the fact that users have to pay quite a lot to use the full app disapointed me (it is a yearly subscription program, I thought I would only have to buy the app once). Also, it is not very intuitive : it has a lot of pop-up videos, questions, letters and you can't go back to mark your tasks from the day before if you forgot to log them in."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Let me out. I don't want this anymore, I wish to unsubscribe. How do I do it?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Motivational! Obviously we choose our paths, but this acts as a kind, friendly reminder with uplifting & motivational ways to you on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App was just awful, I cancelled the subscription before the free trial ended, this was a month ago, and now they've take ¬£35 out of my account today, I don't even have the app downloaded and haven't for over a month. I cancelled the subscription at the start of may!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app should say upfront that it cost money instead 9f baiting people I uninstalling right away and don't want your 1 week trial good day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great guide and reminder to new habits. Luv the app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"To o controlling and exclusive. Mental health aids should be free (funded by others and not by ads or users) and accessible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A simple, easy way to change your life by building small habit by small habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the hearts and smileys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"UwU"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping me set reminders for healthy habits. I truly love checking them off and the ability to add in habits I need to do along with ones recommended by the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent Content, but ""You have 15 minutes / 24 hours to claim this special price."" isn't true. I waited a couple days and nothing changed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is pretty good but what frustrates me the most is the fact that they will take your subscription but the problem when you trying to cancel it if you don't have access to a web page or computer you will not be able to cancel it you have to use a computer to do so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very fun way of building healthy habits, I'm really enjoying it so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for those who are looking to change their lifestyle but need guidance on what steps to take, you just have to commit to the tasks it gives you. No matter how trivial they might seem, small steps will snowball into big changes :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"that helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unique. Unlike any other app. Customisable. Educates you to understand your mind and body through accessible scientific research. Highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app i would say,the UI is just amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My card was charged for their annual premium when I only agreed for the 7 day trial and have them notified me via email if I want to continue using their app. I already uninstalled the app before the 7-day period and I didn't even get notified that my free trial is about to end and they'll be charging me. Now, I don't even know how to unsubscribed!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I want to try this app, but I don't feel the need to give my fingerprint to ""sign the contract"" I could type my name or create a special signature or something. Idk. So I didn't use it or get past the fingerprint thing. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, maybe I'm just paranoid, but why fingerprint? Oh well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update I got a full refund, but only because I emailed them right away. You still shouldn't be charged for an entire year if you only use it for a week or a month. Signed up for free trial and never had time for it. Planned on canceling it and they charged me for a full year at 7pm on the last day of the trial. It's now 12am and they are making it difficult to cancel subscription. Stay away from this app. A truly good product shouldn't have to trap potential users. Refund my money you crooks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's nothing notable here. A couple of checklists set to times of day. Prefab. There's items to list that are prefabbed. The list has a set time to alert you. You can customize the list, its items, and pick some art or color that goes with it (only from a set). And since you can do that before getting this app, with built in features, it's just the art, the chime, and the prerecorded platitudes that you're paying a non refundable 1 Year subscription for?! Guides and forums not worth $40/y."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great experience without paying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like my experience with this app, I wish it was totally free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. Great visuals. Great features."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hello! Fabulous I'm Faiza I'm from Bangladesh. And I'm a child. I was so lazy. when I found this app I was üò≤üòØüòØüòÖ I was so excited and I start my new life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a app that will guide you to a better path in life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Wag na sa premium, all free haha"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps you form n keep a routine, whatever you choose"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the app runs good with no complications. Invest in yourself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has really helped me set up a better routine for when I wake up in the morning. Having a routine when I wake up has had a significant affect on the rest of the day. I would recommend using this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beware. It's a scam. It was annual subscription for $39.99 after one free trial month. Then they hit you every other months with $39.99, suddenly it's quarterly subscription when my invoice clearly stated ""annual subscription"". When I contacted them for an explanation, they wanted me to submit a refund request with no explanation what so ever. I'm still waiting for their response as why an annual subscription suddenly turned into quarterly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it ‚ù§ üëë"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just starting and finding this app to be very good, very motivational and I like it so far. I am already on my phone, so why not use it to help with the rest of my life and how I feel. Check it out..."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app very easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So first off I removed this app and canceled my subscription and they still charged me for another year anyways. I didn't like it and thought the story line they use was fake woke. I paid for the year and with in a month stopped using it. Canceled my subscription. They charged me again this year even though I only used it for one month last year. Canceled again and they refuse to give me my money back but keep sending me coupons for a free month even though they have charged me for a full year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just started it and already it's coaching me to SLOW DOWN. To me that's amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible review I have been trying to cancel it since I downloaded it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First the app charges twice for annual subscription within 15 days. Next built-in reimbursement request doesn't work. I'm done"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It‚Äôs like social media but healthy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't cancel the subscription via their website for months. The app send me to the website to cancel it. Sent them 2 emails begging them to cancel - no answer. Keep paying 2$ a week for months, for nothing. Haven't used the app even 2 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience Fabulous! Beware! You are charged 40‚Ç¨ after a trial period even if you cancel and do not intend to use the app! very dishonest, no? I have seen other users have this kind of problems. I wrote emails to the assistance, but no constructive replies arrived. So, I guess I will go to the POLICE office."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really a great app. And I already had started picking up new good habits.I have no complains about this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me feel happiness in my day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ooh!! Getting problem in starting the app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Easy to follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"tldr: horrible if you don't subscrube, but good if you do. This app is unusable if you don't subscribe. The full version is very good, but they are not clear on payments (when you get charged nor how much you will be charged). If you don't subscribe, then you are bombarded with unskipable ""cut-scenes"" and ads, you cannot create routines even if you have had an active subscruption in the past. The full-featured app is good and helpful, but very expensive and unclear when payments will occur."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really do feel that Fabulous is a great app! It keeps you focused, on track and gives you a wonderful mindset for the day! It's 110% reliable and keeps you focused! Believe in yourself and anything is possible!!! I love this app! If you are reading my comment, then give Fabulous a try you'll love it just like I do!!!üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has made it so easy for me build habits! If your looking for a way to help with breaking bad habits Fabulous is the way to go! It also helps motivate you by having a story/journey mark point whenever you complete a day of habits. I totally recommend this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing habit i started a few days ago but its amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app with cool features and experiences"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still working through the app but so far very helpful. Im working through my habits. The motivation, letter and community is so helpful. So far my favorite part."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, really well organized, great additional and outside information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well Made app that makes you feel like someone really cares about you. I know, it's hard, but it's free AND you cant lose anything by giving It a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Supports behaviour change slowly for sustainability and in an encouraging way"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is really a great tool to help build new habits and set some realistic goals. Direct and simple to use and it's engaging. Im giving it 4 stars as I wish I had access to everything the app has to offer without paying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I do like this app it's good to start a foundation within yourself by making good habits and challenging yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I never like the free for a week shtick it always feels like a scam and anyone who actually wanted to try it can't without having money on there card first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you just use it. You will change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App has nice functionality but wrapped in a little too much fluff. I feel like it tries too hard with the inspirational imagery and ends up feeling fake. The ""coaching"" content is particularly egregious."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forces you to put in payment info before giving you any indication that the app is worth paying for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I loved the rpg-style storytelling, and the aesthetics. I also liked that the healthy eating section was about giving your body helpful nutrients and demoralizing food, not centered on ""losing weight"". But then it recommended IF, and I had to uninstall. It advised against doing it if you have a history of EDs, but IF *is* an ED and is a quick way to develop one. The scientists publishing the journals on ""benefits"" are making money off of framing the addictive properties of EDs as ""healthy""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so amazing. It makes you become a better version od yourself, improves your mental and physichal health and guides you through tough times. Love it 5/5 :) <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far. Really helpful im gettinge back om track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gamifies good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Expirince is optimal usel things and reads tools are for better expirince and a blog or community connected win ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Did it get worse? I was using the free version a few months ago, and now all of the options for adding tasks to the routine are gone. I can make my own task with an ugly little icon, but for example ""stretch"" used to have lovely artwork and be a default option, same with ""deep focus"". Were these removed totally or does it come with premium now?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took nearly ¬£70 out of my bank. Not happy at all. When I log in it says I'm on the free plan but you still took 2 payments out of my account for 34.99 one after another!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app. I am not able to use it ever since I downloaded it. All the time it shows contents can't be auto filled and a blank blue screen. Pathetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Good idea but decided not to purchase after the trial. I did unsubscribe on day 5 of the 7 day trial only to have attempts made to charge me an amount of $55.95!! Not once but 3 times in the course of a week!! I thought it strange when signing up for the trial they ask you to re-enter your payment info in addition to having permissions through the play store. I guess this is how they were able to access my card details after I unsubscribed. Not cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app with money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me reschedule my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Complicated and too expensive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing?!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It motivates me everyday through the daily/nightly coaching and the story line which relates to how my brain was really thinking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It's adaptable for any lifestyle , has tons of habits to chose from and let my procrastinating butt restart as many times as I needed to get it right."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best habit tracker app!!! So much better than any I have ever used!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the best app for me. üíúThank u for creatin it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good and motivating. But they should be more obnoxious with the reminders. I normally hate to get notifications, but we actually need more of this app cause i like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how kind the app is as I make daily steps towards my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Cluttered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"For me - not worth the subscription fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Motivational words"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam, this won't change you're behaviour as they claim. They also ask your credit card from day one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Wanted more access tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not a free app at all!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful, I cancelled trial and have been charged, seems to be no easy way of contacting about a refund, SCAM!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful with day to day activities"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very high production value. I was going in expecting a run-of-the-mill schedule planner or something of the sort (cause that was really all I needed in the first place). However this app proceeded to completely blow my mind with how high quality every single aspect of it was. Everything from the UI, to the sound design, to the epic poem-adventure that they made. Honestly, it's a bit overkill (in a good way lol). Great job folks, keep it up!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trying to cancel the subscription before the trial ends but it says to do it from the browser version. When I log in from the browser it just says there's no account with that email even though it's the correct one. What a scam. Should be able to cancel from within the app. Now I have to disable my card from the entirety of Google Play."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Woowüëè concentrating in small small details its what make this app distinctive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Good app , but plans are so Costly that 99% of students can't buy itüòî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Once you get to know the app it is amazing and very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great app! But I'm very disappointed. It is the third time you kept trying to make me pay when I've already unsubscribe me. Please stop, you made me delete my cards from Google pay, it is very unrespectful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"1 of the most important app I can say app of life Extremely recommended for growing üíó physically, mentally and spiritually Me, Shafen, is absolutely thankful to team fabulous for this fabulous app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is encouraging and motivational. Small steps develop small habits that help us to achieve to life purpose goals is the promise. A bit hard to navigate at 1st but I think over time I'll figure it out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app!!! So powerful and uplifting. Please download ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So many great helpful things you can easily incorporate into you day!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep you on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It actually feels like progress. It also helps that there are different things for each day, so far. Not just a reminder. It really engages you with your goals instead of just reminding you about them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"First couple of weeks have been beneficial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful UI, weird cost structure, super rigid structure, annoying American accented computer generated voice chiming in all the time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love it and I didn't think I would because the branding appears to be marketed more to women. That said it's been helpful to build up healthy routines slowly and consistently. I feel more relaxed, present and can say I actually enjoy mornings now so that's a big win! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a reminder app or daily planner. Well worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not download this. I took the 7 day trial and was supposed to pay a monthly fee and seems that I was charged for the whole year and I domt even know how to cancel it because nor in google play nor in the app I can cancel. I will get my money back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charged account after I thought it has been cancelled, as Icancelled via the google play store, I even received an email fro Fabulous after the end date asking me to join premium again, which i didn't. They also didn't notify me they were going to be charging my account for the yearly subscription. Edit. I did contact your team, along with proof showing I had cancelled. I haven't received any response. I fail to see how this can be a ""misunderstanding"". Be warned before signing up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Forced to pay for the year. I took the free 7 day trial. And couldn't see myself using this app. I have no option of cancelling the subscription under subscriptions. It didnt even come up and eventually took ¬£34 off me. I would like to get my money back and I do not want a subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is pretty much trying to rob you, first the app will give you very stupid goals to do and if you want to actually set good goals it make you take terial, like everyone said if you don't wanna spend money here don't even bother dowloading or you end up like the rest 90% of users running for you money witch they steal from you. And then you come here to wrote a review maybe they listen and then they tell you the same setence that they writed and they just copy and paste probobly for me now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"No good if actually struggling. Its too hippy dippy positive nonsense when you're actually just trying to be ok. Also I found the structure annoying and too rigid."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"There is a problem in this app, in this app there is no continue button on save your progress after email. Please fix this problem."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Extremely well put together"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is there a possibility that you can allow people to do the 3 a month payment instead of the 35 a year"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app is truly impossible to navigate. It looks great inside, but actually moving around within it is a terrible experience. I accidentally payed for an annual subscry, so I have had a year to try to figure it out, and it never became intuitive. I even looked for YouTube walk-throughs and blog posts about how to use it, and I couldnt find anything helpful...likely because no one else has figured out how to actually use it effectively either."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everyone please be informed that if the free trial is done they will automatically charge you for the premium membership charge. And if they automatically charge you, you can only refund it in less than 48 hrs of the time that the membership is bought. For the devs, please remove the bs of charging automatically for the premium charges."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this apps when they tell a story telling about self development. I love the challenge and the information this apps give proven by someone who is master it. I love this app to improve our habitual that we didn't know become know. This app is amazing..... ü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Disappointed and disgusted. I cancelled my subscription before the free trial was up, and money was still taken. Furious Sub standard app for the money they want. I have visited you page and clicked contact us. Even this is convoluted and long winded. Disappointed, annoyed and fed up with your generic response to ALL the complaints. Funny how the complaints are about the same issues I had. Perhaps you need to take a look at how you can make things easier and less complex."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I truly enjoy this app. I used it a year or two ago and now I'm back. It invites change into my life in a calming manner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivational & inspirational app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty‚ú® well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app loots our money after cancelling our subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great useful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sounded interesting lightweight was looking forward to it until after filling out all the personal questions it tells me for $40 a month I can use this app instantly deleted it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is a really great app that helped me be more productive and it had so many features the I was just amazed that you could meditate, exercise, develop great habits things and it's really great overall. But you have to get premium for just some sessions and small things like that so I'm not too glad about that. But fabulous made me follow some good habits such as drinking water and meditating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hello! I've been charged for annual subscription twice in a matter of few days. Once the discounted rate of $24 and then full price of $39 for the same year. My support requests have not been responded to. Can someone check and get back to me?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy and enjoyable to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After about 20 days, I determined this app wasn't for me. You can't cancel your trial through the app, it has to be done through the website. On the website, you're met with several retention screens. I thought I canceled the subscription, but my card was charged today. I missed clicking a white link on a blue background. This type of customer retention tactic isn't fair to customers hence the 1-star. If you try this app and don't like it pay close attention to the cancelation process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could go lower i would, have not been able to unsubscribe from this abomination, as it continuously tries to charge my account, peace and wellness, more like fraud and insanity"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app looks amazing and has an easy to use interface and easily understandable however I don't think that a 7 day trial is no where near enough time to decide whether I want to pay a full $40. Not only that but the app starts you off by setting a goal for you to drink water every morning for three days so it's actually a four day trial before you get started with the actual app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled and uninstalled after politics reared its ugly head. Makers have an agenda here, which I was happy to discover considering how ineffectual the design is in practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience with app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very thoughtful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good. very motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can tell they put a lot of love and effort into Fabulous as it really works. I'm not sure why but it just works for me when other things haven't. I love that the habits and sticking them to put a spring in my step. Thank you to the Fabulous creators!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't try it cause it cost money and I'm kinda struggling with money and I'm trying to improve my self and start good habits and I feel restricted with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply the best app in the world for getting your life back on track and moving forward on a path of enlightenment! Thank you!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Having to provide payment information before being able to take advantage of the 7 day trial is kind of shady. Cool concept but poor implementation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíïüíóSo Helpfulüíóüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"enjoyed using the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Costs"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is the best routine planner I ever incounterd. It has really transformed my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I still cannot Unsubscribe from the app! Wanted to cancel the subscription after the trial but there is no button to do that. I've emailed the company but still haven't received any response from them! Would not recommend people to try this SCAM as it just debited my money without my consent or notification for a 2nd yr although I had unistalled the App!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years and I love it. Well worth the purchase."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The most exciting adventure üåº No matter if fail - you are welcome to try again! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helped a lot for me..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great up for anyone who wants to start forming healthy habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I like the pacing, starting slow. More so I feel like the messaging and story telling style of motivation helps a lot more. It's not just an app, it's a community with other people trying to do better for themselves in different areas of life. There's a reason they highlight the US in FabuloUS."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Serious, gentle and cute at the same time. Loving and professional app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nunca cre√≠ que una aplicaci√≥n me ayudar√≠a tanto, reci√©n la estoy usando pero me encant√≥ la secci√≥n de consejos ya que te motivan y tambi√©n ves casos de otras personas o puedes pedir ayuda, enserio que me encant√≥ y este comentario deberdad vale la pena por el gran trabajo que hacen, enserio se los recomiendo en la vida no hay que hacer ego√≠sta :>"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for keeping track of and encouraging healthy habits and more mindful behavior."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Update caused my phone to lock up periodically, unable to type or get to my text messages. Good app otherwise, though I wouldn't use the paid version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very easy to follow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great potential, but ruined by overly-rigid execution. Its an app that wants to take you down a path.. its path. Customisation is really difficult so its hard to tailor it to your specific requirements. The cut scenes and pop ups are also quite annoying. I just want to be left alone to use the tools to do my thing without being dragged off task. This is a great app for people who don't really know what they want from their routines. Its not a great app for those that do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No doubt a best app for improvement. Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UPDATE - Still no refund. Have escalated 25/5 - I found this app very complicated to use as I have ADHD and there was too much going on. I unsubscribed, but was tempted back for another try with a 30 day free offer. HOWEVER, as I said, the app is complicated and I accidentally pressed *continue* in the wrong place. ¬£56 was taken from my account!!! I cannot afford this, but I cannot find anywhere to request a refund, so have had to open a dispute with PayPal. I'm really NOT very happy at all!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been pretty helpful but I can't figure out how to navigate yet. I don't know how to access previous things thatve come up that I wasn't able to complete or view in the moment. Also, the golden triangle is very confusing. Also, the little area that insists you pick 3 superpowers for a challenge, again, confusing.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me start simple. As a person with ADHD, routine is my friend. Fabulous is helping me start a simple, easy-to-follow routine that I am able to understand and execute."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"***THIS IS A SCAM APP*** ****DO NOT INSTALL**** They refuse to refund your money even after you've tried to cancel during the trial. I used their steps to cancel on the second day of the trial and was not able to. ****(I showed proof) and they still STOLE the money from me as they refuse to refund me. They are MANIPULATIVE and CONARTIST*****"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it is going well we will see in time how it really goes. It's only day 5 but it has already helped with emotions that usually get me stuck for several days....instead after doing my morning routine it was a few hours instead...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So hard to delete an account no option for this is available. Total joke"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not bad"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a beautiful and helpful app, I feel like I'll use it for a while as a helping hand, but I don't want to get stuck with it, I need to be more flexible, maybe I'll use it as a end-of-the-day check list to see how I'm doing. There is a bug with the permission ""show on top of other apps"" where you can't press the bottom of the screen or some buttons in other apps while Fabulous is in flouting bubble. I had to remove the permission. Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's ok but wants a fairly big yearly fee for premium. No option to pay monthly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not trauma informed. Not addiction informed. The underlying assumption in a lot of the app's statements is that ""you are the problem"". Not a very empathetic app, and it is definitely not the type of subconscious messages I'd like to expose myself to every day. (also white-washed and costs too much)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpfully"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Evasive Advertising- Surprise Paywall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got the premium thing for FREE for a week and I canceled my subscription 4 days in and I'm now charged $40. Me and my homes hate fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty awesome app, starts you out slow building the foundation for change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't find the site and they don't show it anywhere so I can unsubscribe because you're a shady app and can't just make it functional on the app so now I got charged $40 after the trial. Useless app, shady tactics like the usual don't bother with this app it's a messy pile of garbage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gives me the boost I need to get moving."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so reassuring. And so helpful to me. I have never felt more proud of myself lately because of this app. I plan on using this app for as long as possible. It has brought so much positivity and relaxations in my life. I recommend this to everyone. It took me a few days to get the hang of it but just take it nice and slow and you got it. The first time I pushed myself to hard to be great. But if you take it nice and slow I promise you. You will love the results!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving this app so far. It is exactly what I have been looking for. I would of given 5 stars, however I wish there was an option to pay monthly. Other than that an amazing app that I am looking forward to implementing in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I dig it. Sticking to it somewhat .üòè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is truly helping me to be organized in my daily routines, fight over my procrastination and maintain good health.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"You cant cancel your membership after or even before the free trial ends."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivation plus you're going to be on your phone anyways just open up the app lol that eazy !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory billing, minimal support and mediocre app. Multiple different fear of missing out offers and trials with automatic billing. An unmonitored support email which replies with generic links. Different domains and sub domains for account management and login, making it troublesome to find with a search engine. Many dead ends and support feedback loops bouncing you between the app, website and playstore. Unhelpful T&C. You must create a new account on a subdomain to cancel your sub."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really good how it takes you one step.at a time. If I could pay monthly I would upgrade in a second but unfortunately they want you to pay annually and I don't have ¬£40 to use on myself most months üò•"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This fabulous app is really fabulous and fantastic üëçüëç. I like the flow so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good so far idk if I'll pay for a subscription (especially if it's a yearly one but we'll see)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the theme and approach to setting best habits but i dont think it justifies the price but thats probably just me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I thought it was free‚òπÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Won't let me cancel subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"App is great. It's changing my habits in the am and I am starting the decluttering part today. App is worth the money once you learn how to navigate through the app more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helped keep me motivated to improve myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*EDIT: Note the developer's response does not actually address any of my complaints.* Total scam. The people behind this app are predatory and should be ashamed. Cancel ASAP! They make it difficult to cancel. You can't do it in the app (?!?!) and they don't even provide a link to the cancellation page. They are banking on you forgetting or getting frustrated and procrastinating. They're literally using their knowledge of *behavioral science* against you instead of for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfeito! Estou me sentindo bem melhor no meu dia a dia."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app can change your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Isn't necessarily for me. They make it very difficult to cancel and now they have charged my card even though I b have been trying to cancel days before the trial ended."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app. A lot of features and really easy to just and want to keep using. Reasonable cost"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have downloaded the app and deleted after 10 min. They are sending emails to pay the year subscription. An email was sent 3 days ago when received the first email, and now received another email. Please, stop sending emails!! I do not agree on having a subscription!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Great information, but also high cost for a yearly subscription compared to another self-care app I find much more enjoyable and easy-to-navigate (and you can play it for free). I wish I could get a return on the subscription because now I won't be using it for months and the sub will go to waste."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It says 3.33 ILS / month (40 per year) but when i proceed to payment it says 150..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Morning & Night Coaching dialogues alone are enough to keep me motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nindot sya nga app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Want to buy but there is no Google pay option"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So I have ADHD and ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and so sticking to everyday tasks is impossible for me It's a chore and mentally exhausting to remember to brush my teeth or take a shower at the end of every day. And this app really helped me stay on top of that. This app offers quite little if you don't pay for it but it's still alright regardless. I like it anyway. It's got it's uses even if you aren't going to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its helpful if you don't already have an idea on how to change certain things. Its very useful though. Just try for yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Important features are in premium. If you don't pay you will not access to the most of parts. Just simple alarm"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"My main complaint about this app is that they don't allow you to just subscribe month to month. You have to pay for a whole year, and to me that tells me that the developers don't have any confidence that this product is good enough to keep me subscribed for a whole year. I personally would be willing to pay extra for a month to month subscription. I would rather pay $5-$8 a month with no strings attached than to be forced to pay a whole year's worth at $3.33 a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Used this app for a week, it just is too many things, UI part of it feels nice other parts looks sorta out of place, the app feels over the top, Honestly it is a great effort, however at this moment of Time I will rate it 1 star it started to annoy me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is not very user friendly. It's very hard to navigate to do even the simplest tasks. I've been trying to quit my 7 day free trial before it charged me and I can find how to do so!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me being energized and make a good habits ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Is there a family option, if like to use it for me and my kids together and be able to set it for them from my phone?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"overwhelming & over charged me. Confusing and unhelpful for my neuro-divergent brain."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its amazing Helps me set my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app I makes me calm and feel good üëç love it you should try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a good app with lots of great animations to inspire us.. the only thing is it is a paid app. So it has its own limits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been using it for a week. And I can say I am forming good habits and learning to be productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has so many ways to customize your experience with becoming Fabulous! I like that I can face myself right where I'm at, choose the things I feel I need to work on, and do so with great coaching, beautiful backgrounds, no shame or scolding, etc. I recommend getting the paid version so you can have an ad free run at this ""makeover."" You don't want or need ads to distract you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely app, seems well thought out and thoughtfully designed. Excited to see where it goes over the course of my trial period."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asks you a load of questions then wants 35 pounds a year subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful in staying focused and making real behavioral change!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app that caught my attention with great marketing. Thankfully it also provides benefit to my life as promised. Would love to see a dark mode, especially given that during a bedtime routine you might want to use the app in the dark. The bright white screens at night are a dissappointing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm sure it has potential to be a great app but why they gotta make it so gay? Can't we have one for straight dudes?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I rarely give a bad review, but in this case I sadly must. Fabulous charged me twice, once the moment I signed up for the free trial, and then again when I actually decided to go premium. I reached out to their customer support twice, but no one has bothered to respond. Update 21.05.2022: I have now heard back from their customer support and they've refunded the extra charge, which I appreciate. The app is useful, but the trust needs rebuilding. I'll review whether to renew later in the year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've used it for a week. It's kinda different from others. I'm liking the whole personal touch and motivating articles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like that it's very mindful and realistic. It's free to use, but I plan to eventually get the one year upgrade. I think this can really change my life. It's about mind, body, and soul. **edited I have since used the app again and still love it, I just wish they had a monthly option. I have not been able to afford the yearly option. Even if I had to pay 3 months at a time in a cheaper amount. That is the only thing I would change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great encouragement w/ a cool storyline. Wife got me this to help me accomplish my goals. Helps me remember things when I'm busy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I had troubles getting into this but have changed up a few habits/ routines and hope that helps. I do love spending time on the community with everyone. Good stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"CANNOT FIND WHERE TO CANCEL FREE TRIAL BEFORE I AM CHARGED, not showing up in Google play and can't do in the app. beyond that it seems clunky and not very useful for is stated goal as it's trying to get you to engage With your phone first thing in the morning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simple. Easy. Effective. Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving ‚ù§ everything about Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think the apps should ask the user more details questions about our routine. Like my morning routine, I do drink water and have breakfast in the morning but the apps ask me to do so like I didn't practice it in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How to cancel?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is keeping me on track with some positive changes I am wanting to make in my daily routines and life in general."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So it's day three, and I'm enjoying the direction and positivity of this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's incredible & exciting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the application well and see some changes in my daily routine and i will be continue use it. TNx alot Fabulous ,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love an app that prioritizes self care"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy the app, it keeps me on track so that way my day becomes more habitual and intentional as apposed to needing reminders. So when the reminders come, I can choose to journal or just check off the list! Quick, easy, and straight to the point...I love the cliff hanger story time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous feels like having a kind personal assistant to keep you on track ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Unfortunately I have a fractured left arm at the moment so I haven't been able to go for a walk...what I have been doing is working harder to fix my fractured arm by doing more home rehabilitation everyday, I have let myself kinda have days off without caring and with this app I'm starting to care again and reinforce doing my exercises every morning, noon and night. I will never walk of a üåÑ but definitely afternoons! Slowly but surely getting there!!! It feels good to be in control again!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a good app. I'm on day ten and I feel great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"5 star all day üíõüíõ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"No contact from developers. App seemed great but the free pass isn't working so I'm still left not knowing if I want to pay out for premium. I'm keen to use it but just disappointed now that I can't progress. *Edit to respond to comment from developer: I have done that multiple times and no response. Yet, I have done it again. Hope I'll hear soon because the enjoyment/helpfulness is waning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"awesome app. it is changing my life for good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Didnt use it yet because everytime i turn it on (usually while my son is sleeping beside me) it plays music quite loudly while its loading. Remove the annoying opening music and i might investigate it further"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! It's helping keep me in check with many different aspects of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app helped me be motivated towards everything I do in a day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great app I have improved my routine a lot I'm improving myself. Great experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I would strongly recommend this app for anyone struggling with developing healthy habits. I've struggled with the most basic habits over the years: not sleeping enough, exercising, eating healthy, having a messy home, and struggling to manage a full time job whilst studying at uni. Over the past couple of months using this app, I have gradually transformed my personal life from complete chaos to stability. It is not immediate, but is very effective and I look forward to my continual progression."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pretty nice so far! Routines have been helping a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful, easy to use and understand. I love how it breaks down the steps you need to move forward in your life and managing your doubts and self-esteem ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever downloaded! A total game changer if your open to creating change and healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the lay out of it and how it doesn't hit you all at once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's day 2 for me and I find this app inspiring. My morning thought process has changed from one of self doubt and punishment to one of kindness and love for self. I highly recommend this app to everyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptionaly brilliant app! Keep it up,would appreciate more meditation methods."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüéàüéàüéàüéàüéà"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is very useful app, highly recommended if you really want to make a difference in your past and future self (as a beginner on this journey). It keeps you on track by reminding you timely, motivating you and most importantly an appreciation text after completing your task. It is like someone is having a check on you for your own betterment. So if you are struggling in order to make a difference in life than you should download it without a second thought...!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty good job at keeping you on track with the habits you want to get better at doing and gives you a real feeling of self confidence when completing goals or challenges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hard to navigate in the beginning but overall good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Working good so far!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective for the committed individual."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to create mindfullness and goals for yourself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great lil app. Its really easy to follow. Its chock full of health habits. Great tool for getting your mornings afternoons and evenings in order"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very motivating reminder of the routines that build daily habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love the fact that the team who developed the app took into consideration that people wanna hear others stories and wanna be part of communities but also have the option to join whenever they are comfortable. This app is really helping me adjust to my new living environment!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"User friendly and pacted with helpful content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great way to kickstart change in your life by setting personal goals. This comes with a sense of accomplishment."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so much easier to set goals and habits when there's little bursts of motivation and cheering. I get a smile on my face when ever I check off the to do list for routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have only been using this app for a few days but I already love it. It's simple, easy to follow and feels very motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Started 3 days ago and already seeing progress in my daily living"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I have ever had. It litteraly holds your hand as you make consistent positive changes in your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very useful application although I'm still figuring it out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like how the app is tailored to your specific lifestyle, goals, and needs. I've only be using it for a couple days and see a huge difference already. The prompts are very efficient too. They're designed to help you identify what you've been overlooking in a simple yet, very profound way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app so far! I have been using it for a couple weeks now and so far I'm loving it. Only app that I was able to find that has reminders that constantly remind you on your goals. The morning and nightly readings it gives have been very interesting. So if your looking for an app for motivation on yourself and goals this is the app. I have anxiety, sleep problems, procrastinate alot and have hard time focusing on things. I will update my review after using the app longer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful place to start if you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed in life. With gentle guidance, customizable daily actions and routines, affirmations, inspirations and so much more. This app has so much to offer anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simple but effective this app. Making you 1% better each day, as day by day creates the bigger picture"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it. Unfortunately, the best features, require real money but a lot can be done for free. It does help with good habits, it's encouraging and it starts small. When I switched devices, I did lose my progress but that may have been my fault for not backing it up or backing up may have been part of the premium users. Still good tho"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Read the other reviews. Seriously. Not only will you see many repetitive complaints about the HORRIBLE inability to cancel the subscription, you will notice almost every single review about the lack of customer service, promptly followed by a cut-&-paste reply(see below) from what they laughingly call ""customer service"". Sure, the functionality&usefulness of the app during the trial is decent, but think about it....there wouldn't be so many complaints about cancelling if people loved the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not through my first week but there are already aspects of the that I find highly annoying. First is being a premium member and then getting pop ups to advertise for the app by telling friends. Second was it wanting to connect with my face book about to do a pledge ot something? It's frustrating that a paid app is being intrusive in these ways. I am sure for some folks these things don't matter but it really bugs me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great start but repeats after a couple months despite paying for year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was double billed for the subscription and PayPal did nothing about it. I was initially charged $49.99 via PayPal, but then an additional $39.99 charge appeared (both from Fabulous.) This application, the experience, and the busy/confusing interface is not worth an $89.99 annual fee! So if you want to use their service, watch your account for extra charges and fees."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the different audio coaching for morning and night."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I reached out to check I wasn't going to get charged renewal and was assured I wasn't. Only to find my credit card charged for premium subscription. They make it hard to stop the subscription. Stick to the free version. The paid version isn't that amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ± ÿ≠ŸÑŸà ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ŸÉŸÑŸá ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ¨ŸÑŸäÿ≤Ÿä ÿ®ÿ≥ ÿ¨ÿØ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÅÿ© ÿ®ÿπŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿπÿßÿØÿßÿ™ ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ© ŸàŸÇÿµÿµ ŸàÿÆŸäÿßŸÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Just not enough to build an app and bill it 40¬£ a year. The overlay works awefully and you cannot program activities properly, just set the order and youll get bombarded in succession. You just woke up? Cool you should have brushed already while your alarm is ringing. Just not enough this is barely an app and it gets annoying very very quickly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pressures you into starting trial without showing you what the app actually is. Google Play checkout flow showed up first, then only their own via webpage, which looked REALLY scammy (like cmon, you work with behavioural science, ""check out within 15 minutes for your deal!! hurry!! don't think!""... An app like this doesn't deserve the benefit of doubt for things like that). Slow UI interrupting you as you try to navigate the app. Couple of days in and not really getting anything out of it. Meh."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app! The design and stories are gorgeous. And most importantly. It is helping me to build new habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unexpected bills, you can't unsubscribe from the play store"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app I like having a positive minded community to share things with and a check list for the main goals of the day the stories and parables are so great and the graphics showing your own journey is both beautifully done and very motivating!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Relaxing and helpful, I do wish there was a widget to show the routine you are currently working towards"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app back in 2018 to help me get organized for final test preparation. I had all the ambition, motivation, and dreams but I still didn't have the drive and push to start. Fabulous helped me, starting from small change of habits built to stack, that would make the greatest change I could have. Long story short, I got the highest average score in my school. Words cannot describe how helpful this app to me. This app helped organizing my life and it did a great job on doing so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have asked countless times and searched countless times how to cancel the premium subscription before I get paid higher, and this app doesn't care. Do NOT pay money for this app as canceling the subscription will be a near impossible hustle, i guarantee you they will reply to this post like every other saying ""contact the support"" but when you do they never answer you and just wait for you to get charged. Absolutely ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Only just started my journey and loving it so far. However it's only a 3 star because the gifting page is not working, neither are any of the gifting rewards. Just taking me to a blank page. Running the latest version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I have started and it is going well! I like that there is a story element and that I get achievements along the way!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me and I am not even subscribed. And I can't even stop it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Emotionally damaging. It feels like an overbearing parent giving you an overwhelming number of chores to do. No good at all uf you have adhd."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app its amazing!!!! Allrigth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps the unorganized get organized really easy to use and begin"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's not free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the apps. It keep me in the vibe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very sketchy. I was charged to PayPal 7 days after downloading the free version without consent, and I never even got upgraded to premium. Wouldn't have even known if I didn't see a PayPal receipt come through my email. Not sure how this even happened as I never linked the app to my email and there are no subscriptions for it in the Playstore. This is something I might have paid for if I liked the free version enough, but after that, no way. Edit: I did try to contact Fabulous. No response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm very disappointed with this app and their lack of customer service. Only a website that decides from multiple choices if you qualify for a refund and no way to explain your case. READ THEIR FINE PRINT WHEN SETTING UP PAYMENT. IT'S TRICKY! I signed up for the 7 days free with my PayPal to be charged after 7 days for $39.99. Instead, it charged immediately $49.99. I tried to cancel 5 days later (after some serious investigating of how to contact the company) and their website decides I do not qualify for a refund. I'm really surprised there are companies still able to take advantage of customers this way, especially one that touts this mindfulness. So disappointing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you check your phone first thing in the morning this app is for you to change yourself. This is like a guide from the moment you open your eyes and check your phone. This will guide you with your morning rituals, challenge you and keep you engaged with its beautiful storyline and graphics. Bring a very big change in your life by making you take small steps with a very cute way of asking to take steps which you will not be able to deny."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been using Fabulous for just under a week and I can already see the difference in my daily routines and my commitment to them increasing. I will update my review after completing my first month. Stay tuned."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Tried the app 2 times. I really hate the sounds it produces. Its not intuitive. I give it 2 stara becouse the idea is good and probably would work and be helpful if it wasnt offputing. I haven't noticed any bugs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing! Very easy to use, smart, help you make incremental changes in your life and i am very happy with it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Trying for a week and so far I can't go on any of the journeys or use any of the features. Don't bother w the trial. Waste of energy trying to get access to different pages. It just keeps leading me in circles to sign up continuously to 7 day free trial page after I have already logged in using credentials."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app suggest you to some good habits and remind you about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a brilliant app no pressure to build on yourself, but it's working for me and I don't feel overwhelmed. Great work!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing it changed my life and now im becoming the best and better me‚ú®üòç its really amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Actually useful and very user friendly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is like a best friend that puts you before everything and has your back no matter how complicated or distant you are."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulistious"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's nice and I'd dedicated consider buying the plus version if it wasn't so expensive really keeps me in check for my daily routines I love it but I might go find a free version instead"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice design, even in the free version it's really been helping me avoid procrastination, reducing my screen time and waking up early"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"seems pretty good so far. I like that it actually times out the activities as soon as ADHD. that's something I often forget to do üôÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Load of rubbish. Tried the free trial, and I realised I literally could have used my phones 'notes' app. Then I tried to cancel my subscription and it wouldn't reimburse me. Thieves. Just desperate thieves taking your money really quickly and making it hard as possible to give it back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ÂéâÂÆ≥Âïäüíúüíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The App seemed great, however it was impossible to use. I couldn't even get through the set up process it was SO glitchy! Then it caused my phone to get glitches, I has to Uninstall and reset my phone. Too bad because it seemed like it would be great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app makes habit building an rpg video game where you are the main character. It's fun and it keeps you engaged to know what comes next"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good amount of customization makes this habit-former very useful, and it is also motivational and offers a lot of guidance and support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This would be such a great app if it wasn't for the subscription prices, I believe that if the app creators want to help people they should be doing it free of charge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a yearly subscription and immediately attempted to cancel because I haven't used the app for sometime. Using the ""Contact Us"" link on the site as suggested takes me to another form, not a customer service person. Trying to cancel my subscription I'm told I won't be reimbursed, even though no service has been provided to me. Feels pretty scummy for a ""wellness"" app to use a dark pattern like this. BEWARE! EDIT: I was already a paid user, not a trial user."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I get lots of apps like this. This one I actually use and it's becoming a habit, something I've always struggled to set."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"need to purchase a subscription not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its really a cool app and helps you create goodnes in your life, i must say it's you that have to be strong and do what they teach you to do,is not easy but if you follow the steps that they gave you,you can succeed üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I used this app for a year. The reason I chose to not renew is because the app pressures the user to join social media, which I didn't like. Maybe an extrovert would enjoy this feature? Another thing I found grating was hearing the word fabulous, fabulous journey, here in fabulous twice a day during daily coaching. The annoyance added stress in using the app. Overall, it's a great habit building app and I'm grateful for what it offered."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Canceled my subscription to the app long before the free trail end date, they still charged me for the year. I checked the app and I don't even have the subscription features, so they just took my money without even giving me anything in exchange. I emailed the sellers weeks ago, still no response, still working on getting my refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app so far. So much effort has been put into this to give you the motivation you need. It has its own social forums, motivational sound clips, and customizable challenges and journeys. I'm very happy so far. I think it's worth the annual fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't really have a problem."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam. I am disappointed, dissatisfied, and angry with the fact that users unwillingly get charged for a service that is not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very smooth interface and graphics. The plans and tasks are simple and helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to quit and Uninstaller. Not for me anyway. Day 3 on premium and all it does is tell me to drink water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app, wow. I have been trying to work on myself. And to build on loving myself. When I first started my journey I had no idea where to go or how to move towards it.The way Fabulous works is enlightening. It teaches you how to build habits and an environment to build out good habits. It's been so easy to follow and calming. I am still unbelievably impressed by the way its designed to the short content video and audio clips that helps center my day clearly. Highly recommed and worth premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Neat looking but not a fan of subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I use this app to help me reconnect with my journey to wellness. The premium is worth it, but the free content is always a good pick-me-up if you're not ready to subscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It isn't something you can rush into, it makes sure you take your time to get where you're going consistently but not overwhelming! High praises from me foe sure! Very happy with the routines and lay it out in a story with each milestone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"No ads and new updates sometimes that good Gift ‚≠êüíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app, beautiful colours and storytelling which is incredibly powerful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so amazing and a great way to get rid of bad habits and starts good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Ghatiya Totally Paid app And wastage of time....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Feeling better already üòÉ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super fun and helps you to structure your day... provided you pay attention to you phone üòÖ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great app, but you can't use it for free, you only have 7 days free trial, also, you can't pay using gcash"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small, ahievable goals are great! I feel like Ive been doing it wrong this whole time!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I have only done it for a week but I already see the changes in myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's changing my life, which I was in desperate need of. I was drowning. I can breath again, and am making strides I couldn't have imagined. I use this app in addition to therapy. I have been in therapy for 20 years. I've only added on the use of this app for a couple months, and I've gotten more out growth & improvement from my therapy these past 2 months than I did in 20 years."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very peaceful and makes you optimistic to life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Experiencing new challenges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Deletion of my previous review wont help you dear devs the app is not free and after going trough your initial picks you are faced with subscriptions very bad app 1/5 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Downloaded on a whim and bought a subscription my second day. I love how intentional everything is and how is makes you sign contract saying you'll be a better person"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very encouraging!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Make the unsubscribe button available! This is theft. During and after trial period there's no option to back out üöÆ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"this app has been great for me only one complaint: I've moved from an apple to Samsung device and none of my progress is backed up. Since I don't have premium, I cannot get back any of my progress, this is very disheartening and demotivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome üíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Exceptional, really good reminders when I think in too busy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Couldn't cancel the free trial, got billed $55. Looked under subscriptions in both settings and the app store and couldn't see it, tried cancelling in app and couldn't find anything. Update - you need to cancel through their website. Incredibly frustrating because it wasn't clear my subscription was still active in the app. I assumed I wasn't going to get billed. Very sneaky."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It works! Fabulous makes commitment to a better self easy. It's like dividing that huge ogre into bite sized chunks that are easy to swallow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app, except for the constant notifications. Wish I could turn off all but routine alarms to avoid being overwhelmed by them. I'd happily pay for premium if not for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Couldn't camcel free trial, now cannot get a refund because the refund form is broken in the app (cannot upload a picture). Careful about the trial, very annoyimg, also the app is for the V E R Y depressed types, for the first few weeks it's telling you to drink water. Thats it. Literally useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Read about the app. Felt it was the right time to practice looking after myself. So far I am on day 3. Drinking water everytime I wake up. I like the visual content of the app . Messages are really thought provoking."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's kind of hard to get me to do things by myself but over time if I just keep on getting the consistent message that I can do it, really helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ausumn app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app gives me motivation and my first goen superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had to reset my phone and it made me go through the beginning again and even after it recognized my email, is acting like I'd never been working on my health steps. It started me back at 0%"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tries to permanently goad you into going premium and paying for their services. Seven day premium trial automatically converting into automatic paid subscription can apparently not be avoided. Termination of premium trial made unnecessarily difficult and annoying. I find this borderline dishonest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very stressful, they force you to move at their pace, asking questions and not allowing you to skip until you're ready. Also, $39.99 is highway robbery and they won't refund it if you decide against the app and forget you're on a free trial. If you just want a planner don't use this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the pace. Not too much, too fast. I enjoy the variety of choices as well."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged for subscription I didn't ask for. Tried it ages ago under a free trial but didn't care for it, and canceled. Recently received and email they are trying to charge my account with outdated payment information. Verified through the PlayStore I do not have an active subscription for their service. I've received 2 more emails saying payment was declined. I emailed customer service twice without any response. THE WORST. Knock it off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helped me get better at looking after myself and my mental well being"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous helps me have a clear schedule and makes sure that im motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app a few days but it only takes them few days to realize this app is great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I love this app üòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a rip off app. After being tricked in buying a WHOLE year subscription when I only wanted the free trial, after cancelling the subscription the money are lost. I tried before the 7 day trial to cancel but the app is so unfriendly regarding this that I couldn't! Don't use this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app looks promising, I won't be using it because the pricing states 3,33 ZAR/ MONTH but when I click subscribe it is 50 ZAR / MONTH. Thats quite scummy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I am excited to see where the journey will take me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just joined but I am enjoying it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"""Join our cult and give us your money. Now! The clock is ticking..."" (The app itself seems beautiful, but also manipulative and patronizing...)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful in the fact that, it's like having a coach w you to remind you to get to your goals and a healer to remind you to take it easy on yourself. I'm really enjoying this app and it's only been my 3rd day using it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very enjoyable and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Setting subtle pathways for change"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not recommend to anyone who can do research independently. Perfect if you want to be spoon fed someone else's opinion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app helps me keep a schedule and better habits just like I intended the only thing that I find irritating is being able to actually manage and view your premium subscription and the different plans is very hard to do, if nonexistent in the app. I was able to view it only after going online and googling how, I thought I was on a monthly plan but turns out they charged me a annual plan, so they're not supper great at showing you upfront finances. But this app really helps me so yay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"WARNING If you select the free trial make sure you cancel your free trial membership through the app NOT the website or you will be charged even if it was"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The concept is ok, but their customer service is non existent and their billing and free trial communication are confusing. I'm supposed to work on my stress level and the issues with the app are not helping at all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good app üëå. It helped me get back on track and overall improved my well being. 100% would recommend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would really love giving this app 5 stars BUT the fact that you can't do so many things like see the morning routine without paying is sad ,kids whos parents are in some sort of financial trouble can't pay,kids whos parents are not supportive can't pay,parents who don't know their kids have this app (obviously)can't pay. Change this and I'll rate 1000stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would give 0 if I could. The app's beautiful, but it moves so slowly. I realized a few days in to the free trial that I would not continue using the app and I did not want to pay $50. I scoured the app for a cancelation button. I went into my Google play, it didn't show in my subscription or free trial area. I have not talked to a human, but based on ?s when no answer represented my experience they're refusing to refund me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Don't rush it it helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app, while enjoyable, is very disjointed and not intuitive enough for what it tries to accomplish. It's rather confusing for the user at first, wondering what to do next. The biggest issue with the app is that it will not sync your paid membership across devices. If you start the app on a phone and a month later install to your tablet, you have to start your journey over on your tablet. This leaves you with two disconnected journeys. Now I need to upgrade my phone and start all over."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it so far üíù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not a fan, too much going on and hard to follow. Didn't really find the tasks useful. Normally love a self help app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not for me personally, I have anxiety, and how much is going on in the app is overwhelming, just need a simply thing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't know what to say about this app. But... the creator of this app deserve Noble prise üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I think the concept is good. It's way too expensive, the app isn't very intuitive- it's super confusing and jumbly. All that and the mild cringe I honestly could have dealt with, but their little like, spirit guide thing reminds me so much of the creepy kid ghost from the muppets Christmas Carol and it gave me nightmares so that's where I draw the line."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpfulness,lovely pictures,welcome to my life. It improves my English üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried to sign up for the trail but accidently needed paying ¬£30. Emailed them and they said sorry, were aware of the issue but uninterested in fixing it and happy to take the money from someone who would not be even using the app. Disappointing and disgusting way to make money/ business"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Como puedo cambiar de cuenta a premium a normal?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"STAY AWAY. A compelete scumbag app, makes you sign up to a free trial and then automatically signs you up to the highest tier subscription the moment the free trial ends. I have just been charged an extortionate amount and now have no money left for the rest of week. The app is rubbish, the tasks are unimaginative and are overcomplicated, meaning this app is more a hassle than useful. Been disappointed from the start with this app, and now furious knowing they steal from people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is pretty good, but cancelling your subscription for this app is absolutely unintuitive and misleading. It's funny when you search how to cancel fabulous subscription they tell you ""you can cancel it at any time!"" Or ""it's super easy to cancel the subscription"" then they proceed to give you no reliable or no solution at all to how you can cancel the damn subscription. Very very dishonest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really.. I like this app very much. Cause it motivated me alot. Thankyou fabulous ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è with great love.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, Stick with it and you will see change. Baby steps. üíúüíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome motivational tool. This app will not only help you track good habits, but also motivate you to begin the journey to becoming a better person."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is soo encouraging and puts you on the right path, to align with small goals to your biggest goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really great in making and breaking habits. I have premium and I find it's worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think that this app is amazing and it's great because it just reminds you to do things for yourself that are helpful in life that can help you move on to a better life but the only problem I have is is that the premium because you can't put tasks and stuff and who your routines I think that if an app is good for your health and can help you with that sort of thing that should be able to put as much as you can help you move on."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Update: Contrary to the developer's response below, attempts to reach the developer for assistance are stonewalled and rerouted into bot responses and ""we can't help that"". The app specifically targets those with disabilities and exploits those disabilities with the excuse that people without the disabilities have no problem avoiding unwanted charges. Original: Do not sign up for the free trial!!! If you need this app, it's because your life is busy and you will forget to even use it much less cancel. This app is so time-consuming, it's impossible to use and they WILL NOT REFUND when they auto bill you. The support email is unmanned so you can't even get help. Total scam getting rich off people who want better lives. In short, I really wish my review were, ""It wasn't for me, but the developer was great."" Instead, I don't know why it's so hard when someone says I can't use your app at all and want out and instead is told, ""No no no, let's keep dating for a year and see how you really feel."" My irritation is purely because the developer refuses to offer a basic level of support and is instead seeking one way cashflow through less than ethical (though legal) means. I'm still getting offers for free access to premium, but the developer doesn't know how to process a refund because the app is all wrong for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing and tricky to use given the content is for kids. Great idea poorly executed. Hard to figure out how to tailor your experience. Could do with some UX improvements as many others have said. It doesn't do anything that well. You are forced into the long cheesy journey's which is a waste. The company needs to employ a UX agency to get it working. They are fully aware of issues given they state all the major problems when I unsubscribed 10 mins after subscribing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far! Easy to use, not annoying with constant notifications and it actually does work. I feel better after only 5 days. Will definitely keep it up when the free trial runs out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app, helps me develop good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app. They make you use PayPal for the 7 day free period. You cannot unsubcribe, before the 7 period is up. If you can it is made very difficult. I searched and searched to unsubcribe. You then get charged a recurring annual fee. There is no option via PayPal or the app to cancel this It is in my opinion a dishonest and manipulative way of getting you to cough up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a pain to unsubscribe. This app uses the same psychology it uses to help users' routines to drain the bank accounts of users as well. It nearly makes you pick the annual subscription. And even though this is an app, you have to log into the website to unsubscribe. Yeah, that water bottle they tell you to keep by your bedside (brand advertised of course)...they put it in the furthest corner of the dark attic. Not a bad app, just pushy about the money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The greatest app I ever had. It always reminds me good & healthy habits. after I did them It makes me happy & it also provides my mental health. It helps me to manage my time also. After I downloaded this app I didn't waste my time anymore. I highly recommend this app for everyone without any doubt."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was looking at the reviews this morning and a lot were saying how unclear it is to unsubscribe before the end of the 7-day trial. Still, I decided to give it a try but then I changed my mind and tried to cancel right away. GOSH it's so annoyingly complicated!! I have to bounce back between the app, being redirected to the confirmation email, the FAQ instructions, reach out to the contact us link, then I was emailed back and told to go to the FAQ again... what a freaking nightmare!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it.. My husband can't exercise at the moment, so instead him I have Fabulous to motivate me.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app üòÅüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its a paid app. They only give you a week. That should be disclosed BEFORE I put in my information."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was not impress when i saw that i had allready been billed right away when they say 7 day trial , be careful if you think you can try it out before paying .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Still new for me, but I so far I like the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started four days ago didnt see everything it has to offer yet but the UI is amazing and intuitive, the community is great. For anyone thinking about starting you get a 7 day trial (it asks for payment info but you can cancel it before any charge occurs) so just give it a shot. You are investing in yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is not good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Another chargeable app that they don't tell you about until you get into it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the motivation and the reminders to be fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Like this app, second attempt at trying to controll my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"HOW? The steps don't work. What is your telephone or email? WARNING. don't download. I can't sort how to cancel trial before they take money. Not worth it. I don't need an app to tell me to drink water once a day. I need help canceling though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like the apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the review for the free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a scam, its impossible to unsbscribe from the app, they make sure to steal your money on the free trial period. Contact your credit card to report them in case you get charge"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Reviewing the free experience I am enjoying the help this app provides with it's prompts and suggestions. It is encouraging, and slowly brings you into doing more of the things you decide you need to help yourself. 5 stars at the end of week one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wanted this app but i had a sudden change in life and can't afford it! I have tried to put in a reimbursement request but the form won't let me load the receipt!! So I can submit the form!!! ü§¨üò° so it's safe to assume I won't get my money and I will go ahead and cancel, my subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Makes sounds when the phone is in the silent mode"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üòçüòç just just take my love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I personally love it! It has been helping me to get good routines at different times of the day. It has halped my mood and I definitely would recommend it. However, it can get annoying that if yiu wnst to meditate etc there aren't many different types of options unless you pay. However it is still good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has everything you want to stay on track. I am still exploring but enjoy finding new letters and coaching sessions each day! Great for if you want to keep an eye on your progress!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've only been using fabulous for a couple weeks but so far am very happy its really helping me make small changes to my routine particularly first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"1. Too verbose, too annoying. 2. The service asked me when I usually wake up - I answered 9:00 for ""usually"", not always! Next day alarm woke me up - I didn't ask for this alarm! 3. After I registered and paid for a premium (two weeks), I got an email that I can get a first month without payments. Nice. And then every day the same again - ""free month"". I already paid! And why you didn't offer free month during registration?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When I tried to sign up for the free trial, it offered me a deal on the actual subscription if I signed up in like fifteen minutes, but it refused to accept my credit card. Later I tried again and it accepted my card, but I didn't get the deal I was originally offered. Then I found out the app basically won't let you do anything until you commit to drinking water every morning, even though I have a health condition that makes it dangerous for me to drink too much water."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wow, I'm impressed. It is advertised as a $100+ service. I accepted a 7 days trial with a 50 % discount on a yearly basis. The I got an offer for 1 month free with a 50 % discount on a monthly basis. Neat! No, can't change. Looked at how to unsubscribe. Nope can't do that. Have to remember where you bought it (clicked in the app is not an option). Looked everywhere. Read all of the things. Take me to a human. Got an answer. Not a human! Oh, and here you AGAIN have to actively request a human."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am still very new with this app, but it has already helped me start and keep new and positive habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is literally so helpful in setting your goals and actually doing them. It sets alarms to remind you and has clear focused goals and adds time ranges on each so they feel obtainable! I defintely reccomend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I used to be a yearly subscriber, and I have sung the praises of the app to many people, but I'm quitting Fabulous for a couple reasons. One positive reason, I don't need the guidance its programs provide anymore. However, I wanted to continue using the daily habit tracking because I love how the routine mode works and the app's aesthetics, this feature now renders the bottom half of my screen unusable until I force quit Fabulous. I received no response for support."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Hello, this is the best app ever! But there is just a thing that can be fixed that: when you complete a habit you get to see a story video but if somethines you miss it you cannot watch it again. So that's what I want to say. Fix it so that we can watch it again. Thanks.üòäüå∫üåπ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I want to cancel my subscription, i never wanted one , my card is being charged and i can not get a hold of customer service to help me . Why is this so difficult !!! Cancel my subscription right now and do not charge my card !!!!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great for habit tracking. üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I say it's well worth trying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very very good app.. But I don't have the opportunity to premium the version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just beautiful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If u stick to the app daily, you will see the progress for sure. Like simple as drinking water, I was never fan of water drinking and now its just became a habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't used this for long, but I'm great experience already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is a on app stop for everyone who lacks to the will to make a start somewhere. It helps you to take tiny tiny habits to make it your permenent habbit. The premium is the best as it helps you explore through the multiple journeys and learn something new each day. It helps you take up a challenge amongst the thousands of ppl across the word and that motivates u to do better..... Fabulous the name itself says it all. Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Useful. Little sketchy, especially judging from other reviews, but it's done its job so far, and I can't complain."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love how flexible it is to set up to one's personal liking and needs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'll update again once I'm more experienced with it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It starts off slow and random but if you actually listen with intent, it slowly leads you on the path of change. I downloaded it weeks before I actually started following the advice and wisdom in this app (I just deleted the notifications every day üôÉ). It's amazing how similar we all are and how we all have the ability to make our lives Fabulous. ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§ô"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only had it for about 2 days. So far it's great. Personalizable and easy to set up."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It surprises me how much this has helped me push passed my procrastination habits in a short period of time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really like this app and it has helped me but there is just a lot of stuff going on and I even asked for no email's but it went ahead and game me emails anyways it just does random stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"*will update review as time goes My favorite thing is that this app is getting me to drink water, I have always struggled to drink water. Typically I won't even drink 1 bottle a day. Now with Fabulous I'm up to 4 bottles of water. First week on Fabulous. I am really enjoying it so far, this app let's you set goals at realistic paces and there's no negativity of you miss a day or a task. You just try again tomorrow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is beautiful and thoughtfully made. But my experience using it is quite shallow. I don't feel the desire to check in daily, I don't really 'get' much from it, it's a very pretty routine checklist but it's not actually creating behavior change, for me at least. I prefer apps like mindshine that give me tools I can apply when I need them and to build resilience. I think this content does exist to a degree in fabulous, but it's not super easy to find"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still new to the app, but so far I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just getting to know the program This takes action on the part of self If you are interested then commit to self Improvement but more importantly self awareness"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The advertised price is 3.33 Ron/month billed every 12 months. That would be 39.96 ron/year. When I tap 'join free for a week' the price i get in play store is 199.99 ron for 12 months. Is this legal?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Something wrong with App accepting Pal Pay calling bank to insure Fabulous isn't over charging my Bank Acct."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I can see how it might be good, but the user experience is terrible and it berrates you with premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really follows the research of small steps small rewards to keep you motivated and successful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Has problems with Galaxy Fold. Will not work. Adds stuff the Samsung flags as suspicious."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent insight and positive vibe to help me go through ky day and accomplish good things for myself. The simplist things that bring happiness are often overpowered by other things we must get done for others,a job or sometimes we are not motivated because of emotions. This app really has helped me get going in a more happy and productive way to become the best version of myself. I'm choosing to make new neuropathways by trying something new."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"cute and fun helps me wanna do tasks i would usually avoid :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app. Needs some more fine tuning, but a good place to help firm habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Great app lovely picture stories with some motivation would improve it greatly with less notifications through out the day not needed :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"After cancelling the free trial, Fabulous is trying to charge me 38‚Ç¨. Why? It even shows in the app that I don't have subscription anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its my 3rd day so far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps start every day on a positive note."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"says free but when you download theres a cost over 50¬£ a month. I had to remove apps to download this and all that effort for nothing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app everrüíû‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's an overpriced reminder app that annoys you with upgrade prompts, marketing emails and subscription cancellation issues"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAM!! Terrible app, DO NOT SIGN UP! I installed for 1 week free trial, didn't like or use the app and have been charged for a year's subscription. Have tried to cancel the same day but can't get a refund. Have emailed the address given and am told that no such address exists. SCAM!! Edit: I did visit your page and clicked ""Contact"". I also emailed you 5 days ago at the email address you give here, which doesn't exist according to Google. If you want to contact me why not use the email address for me? Because you're fraudsters, maybe?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged for something I don't use, and they are apparently reporting legitimate reviews for removal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've ever used!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am in the first steps and I really enjoy doing that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly enjoyable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged as soon as signed up for free trail"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAMMERS!!!!! They gave me one month of full membership for free and they WITHDREW 40 Euro as a YEARLY subscription from my bank account. Then, in the web page it is written that your next payment on May 2023,BUT THEY WITHDREW ANOTHER 40 EURO FROM MY ACCOUNT TODAY. EVEN THOUGH YOU WILL DELETE MY COMMENT, I WILL SUE YOU OKEY? I don't care about money but I want these scammer to be punished!!!!!!!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is really helping. I'll update in a week to see how successful it's been in keeping me under control."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Honestly helps me with my goal and mking them done! Amazinggg! The layout is also really simple and minimalistic, not with too much stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really comes down to the individual applying themselves, but the app knows that and gives massive incentive for doing so."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app it keeps me motavated and i really like the vibes/asthetic it gives me its a good app. However my schedual times and days change alot with school and famliy dynamics and its hard to keep it the same everyday wich leads to me losing my streak even though i do the things. Furthermore i havent been able to acsess a lot the featurs on the app such as coaching and the questions because of bugs like it kicking me out mid thing and not even being able to even tap on it. But i do love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For me, the app was just too rigid. It suggested a lot of habits that I already do, like drinking water or taking walks. It was difficult to switch journeys to find one that did accommodate my needs, even though I filled out a whole survey about myself when the app opened. I did not see the answers reflected in the journey that was picked for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice app üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app!! It takes you to your goals/tasks easily and also it's easy to use :))."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nothing special. I also just realized that I was charged $39.99 even though I canceled before the first trial was over with"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Without the membership, the free help is so useful! I've used other apps to try and make my irl goals become more satisfying and make them more of a priority, like Habitica. And it did help but for self care, this is the right app for me. When you do something right it shows you a pretty picture and plays a peaceful, happy sound, which sounds so basic, but I've come to want that reminder that I've done something good today. And I want to know that I've earned it. It's really motivating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sheeesh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you for creating this app to fill this need. I'm overwhelmed with gratitude. ü•≤"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's easy to fellow and up lifting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app tries to trick you into an expensive subscription. Beware. It leads you unsuspectingly right into a subscription trap. I've never unsubscribed from an app so fast and had to waste so much time checking all my Google subscriptions to make sure I'm not being charged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to make little changes daily I'm enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpfully and easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Give it a try.üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Could be way better, but I'm disappointed. I was wrongly charged, and I feel scammed. Also no one in support has answered my concern. I really like the idea behind it, but it's very complicated to use (and unmotivating) and the layout confuses me. I will stop using it as I, again, feel scammed. But maybe in some time they'll update the app and have better customer service! For now, it's not that good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Make a companion app for tizen smart watches"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super appli"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only just starting out. But the goals are simple and attainable. There isn't really anything magical or fancy about it. It just helps you build good habits. The interface feels a little bit cluttered, but it's not too bad if you just follow the prompts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really nice and inspiring. It gives you something to hold on to whilst there's a hurricane storming around you, teaches you to swim whilst your ship is sinking,so that you can come back from the dead, stronger and healthier than ever."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way too hard to contact customer support"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good but have less features in free version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience! The daily alerts are randome without being able to organize each specific task to your schedule. Even worse, they have it set to where you can't easily cancel your subscription. I tried to cancel on day 6 and couldn't regardless of the instruction they provided to cancel. I have to go to my bank to block the charge. Do not trust this app it's a rip off. Any app that doesn't allow the subscription to be canceled at ease anytime as it stated, is suspicious."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Feeling gud from the day I'm ysing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"How can cancel my subscription.. it will not let me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has helped me a lot. And is still helping me.. It is easy to use and a great theme. I just wish there was more available for free, as someone who lives in a country where access to online payment methods is quite tricky."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Going well. It was exactly what i needed as i have many small tasks to complete daily and i needed to make them prioritised and time bound."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The Facebook ad I saw for this said ""not a subscription based app"" but as soon as I finished the quiz with the annoying noises it said it was subscription. Not looking to pay that much to have an app that will tell me to do stuff I could just put in the reminders on my phone, also I said no emails and they already sent me one trying to get money from me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would give it 5 stars because I love it. But the commenting or replying on posts is sort of tedious. I mean I reply to people and then either I don't know if they reply back to me...or they may not even know if I have commented. Then, due to financial reasons I can't buy premium, but it seems like that is a goal I will strive for. Other then that this app is worth every single moment you spend on it. Thank you for helping me get better at loving me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stop deleting my review"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I couldn't get past the questions because the screens turns black. I tried several times but what made me uninstall the app was the loud noises. I rembered the old 90's sites with unsolicited music. Made me feel a bit nostalgic and remembers why sites don't auto play music nowadays."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why pay for an app that's meant for your health?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Google play and the app will not allow you to unsubscribe. The benefits are no better for the premium. How do I stop subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"wow just wow"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A very good concept just not something I'd actively use. I also can not find anywhere how to cancel my free trial. Some help with this would be appreciated!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Requires you to have your phone out almost constantly, and then there are no reminders about upcoming payments, so if you happen to forget about it you get charged for another year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wow amazing app... thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"if you just fallow the ap , you will be great , or atlest so much better"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing and it is so fun and helps me be healthy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It didn't make me feel guilty for forgetting to do tasks for over a week. So it's a 10/10 to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Would give 5 stars if we were given the ability to check off a completed routine item a day or 2 after. Pretty deflating to have to start over a great streak just because my sleep routine worked a bit too well for me. My phone is in the other room (advised by the app) so how could I check off my last sleep routine items in the same evening? Didn't realize til the next evening that my streak was wiped. I'm sure this feedback has been given before. Otherwise great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really a fabulous app. I can feel that improves me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I couldn't handle it. I'm not ready to be fabulous. It will have to wait. But it's a nice app and the person who created this has a huge heart. Very loving and beautifully designed app with good use of happy colors. Very encouraging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its a good app but I cant ised it all the time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"surprisingly good and easy. I'm not usually one for coaching in health areas but this app covers all areas of a person's life, not just the physical. The holistic approach is what nailed it for me. I'm actually ENJOYING this and welcoming the support the gentle approach and encouragement it offers. Highly recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app, helps me organise my busy mind"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Be careful before you subscribe the free trial! They charge me while i was already unsubscribe from the app. The subscription is extremely well designed to catch your money from your account one day without any notification or question, i think the spend more time to design the subscription trap than the app. Shame on you you create angry customers on this unfair way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fun and helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous Daily Routine has been very helpful and valuable to improving my life. In just two weeks my stress is lower, I have started building a healthy morning routine, and I am better able to handle the challenges of my day. The art design is really gorgeous, too. A lot of time and care was put into designing this app. I was initially worried about the cost, but this app has proven well worth the price! For the cost of one nice dinner, I get a full year of guidance and support. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't unsubscribe, was renewed for annual membership that I don't want. Looking at reversing the charges and reporting this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, love all the challenges and trainings"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Immediate One Star as there is a yearly subscription, subscriptions need to be monthly, not yearly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The free content is very generous and high quality."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great tool to wake upto every morning and reminds me of my purpose. I add this to my morning routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Second day with this app and it is glitchy AF. I can't open half the items - I click and they start to open and then they just disappear."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's stressing me out more bc I can't figure out how to chance my subscription before it charges me again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful graphics. Easy to use. Makes it easy to reach your goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Took a little bit to write this review because my habits were not good! This app has slowly been improving my morning routine, work routine, and nightly habits. I started using this app for procrastination but now I'm sleeping better, have a good mood at work and all together really and it's surprisingly made me more aware of how much time and money I spend that I don't need spend. If you are looking for a life changing app this is definitely for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm trying to help me with your app maybe more coaching sessions please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its not for free! Waste of time and effort"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not trust the company, they do not honour their free trial, even after lots of back and forth emails they still won't refund the cost even though I did it well within the 7 days. Tenable customer service, often takes weeks between their replies aswell. I also just was not a massive fan of the app hence wanting the refund, I found it very gimmicky and no real substance, but others may like it. Even if it was a great app though I would now avoid it at all costs, all they care about is money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"downloading this mid anxiety attack, first thing I saw was an ""affirmation"": 'you will die. so blah blah' and I ended up in a mental hospital so thanks!! there are better ways to word that and it clearly doesn't accommodate all types of mental issues"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I couldn't find how to set up my own time. I work at night and some of the reminders set up alarm by itself on a day-time basis. Does it allow us to set up our own time? Love the app hope someone can help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In love ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me to track my health vision effortlessly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this very much, please add more bedtime stories."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best self improvement apps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app so far it helped me out a lot ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I only rated it so low because of the whole paymemt thing.. Times are tough right now and alot of people can't afford to be paying for things like this, especially not at the price requested per month if you were to buy it. I was excited at first to try the app first though as everything up until the payment part made me feel like I was actually going to change something."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hicieron cargo a mi tarjeta de plan anual despu√©s de haberlo cancelado. La p√°gina no entrega opciones reales de anular la suscripci√≥n. Hasta el momento no he podido recuperar mi dinero. La peor experiencia con una app que he tenido."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It just ... ""FABULOUS"" you know :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I take the app! It is laying down the foundation for me to create healthy, happy habits and I believe that it's approach is going to do great, great things for me! Stay tuned for more updates.. Go spark joy, Steve"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enlightening"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app it's perfect for people whose routines are unstable but there's something I want to ask that I used it for some days like maybe 1 week but then I deleted it because I can't pay for I am a kid and my parents won't allow so I am scared that after deleting it, will I still have to pay because I agreed to all questions about the paying thing???? I really hope you could give me a reply soon! Hope to see good luck!üòäü§ûüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really keeps you on track and helps to get you out of a funk."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The first week of the free trial they only get you to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning! I cancelled my trial during the first week but I got charged again after a whole year!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's everything I need right now in my life..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You have to out in the effort yourself, but if you are willing Fabulous is exactly what it says it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, no ads, when my paycheck can afford it, I am getting premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When I originally found this app I thought I would just do the trial and move on but I am totally hooked! This app is exactly what I've been looking for my whole life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I eat breakfast. Very goodüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"SCAMERS! I have been charged the full year amount ¬£35 instead the weekly rate shown in the app just to remind me to drink water??? AVOID THIS SCAM APP!! Where is my refund??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful... If you stick to the principles offered here, and then do the tasks slowly and steadily, the program may create a phoenix out of you. I benefitted from this really a lot..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You had me and you lost me. I'm not paying for this lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me build new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am loving the app ü•∞, and feeling too much grateful for this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nicely illustrated, It helping me a lot these days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The fact that you have to pay before you even start is discouraging and just added more stress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it has been very uplifting in my daily routines-the app is accessible and remedial-I enjoy the steady stream of positive content and the authors contributing to the psychology of wellbeing. The routine interface has helped me instill better habits in a gentle, breezy way and I'm looking forward to going further with this app as my bedside, driverside and general environment companion."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It has great intentions, but is super invasive and stops our home button functions till you deal with the notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love that it's interactive and provides realistic accountability. 10/10."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The design and navigation of the app are really confusing. I can add journeys but can't simple habits I want to work on ? Maybe I can but can't figure out how ? Not very customizable and when you open the app there's not a clear set of actions. I had big hopes but was disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely life changing! Definitely recommended for a more uplifting and positive step towards a healthier and more aligned lifestyle. It's done wonders for mine, and anytime I go astray and feel lost, I return back to help reach for balance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using the app for a couple of weeks but it's been really helpful in that time. Planning to keep using it and building healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is as comprehensive as it gets. I am, however, disgruntled that I can not get a refund for the forthcoming 3 months, even though I canceled my quarterly plan. This is very poor customer service. If you want to try a paid membership, go for the month to month plan. This way, if you cancel, you will only be charged for one forthcoming month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helping break old habits and reframe how I'm viewing my health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why was my review deleted? Money stolen even though I requested cancellation of free trial 2 days after using this app. No option or google subscriptions and neither on their website where after login I could only see my profile name :D. ""Free"" trial scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Feeling fabulous from the moment I started."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Simple and upbeat app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Likeing this app more each day I use it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"What happened? This used to be a free app. Now it would like to charge me for a whole year ahead. I prefer payment month per month. Then I definitely would have subscribed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly really enjoying this app. There's a surprising amount of depth in the coaching and daily videos and the incentives to keep going aren't guilt based, so it's a nice, pleasant, rewarding experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged fraudulently from my paypal account. Fraud company"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, very inspirational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so good i have good and healthy habits beacuse of this app now"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too much notifications, I was looking for something simpler"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Update : Got resolved finally . Thanks. I am editing my 5 stars for now unless the issue resolved .. I have done the paymwnt for the subscription but Google Play still shows it stuck and I think my app is on pause . I don't see new posts etc . Please take care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Wish there was an extended free version. While I do enjoy it, the free 30 day passes kinda seem like a joke because it just brings me to a plain white page so I can't see if it works as well as it does for me. (Also in mind I've already paid for the year)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, spiritual and yet based in science"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a really nice app to get your life organized. It's like a virtual coach. Easy and simple to follow."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I downloaded the app to help build focus habits. Ironically, it's full of random phone notifications and emails that are impossible to disable or customize to my exact schedule. For example, the community coaching notification comes through right in the middle of my 8:30am client call - there's no changing it. The concept is great, but the ironic tension between phone / focus is too much to overcome. I'll be going back to post-it notes and egg timers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is my second time using. The app is really designed to take it slowly so that the habits and changes really sink in. If not, you will not get the full benefits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Although I had to be at a time and place within my own life/mental health journey to be ready for changes, this app offered me an easy way to facilitate small changes and gave me a way to focus my time and energy into meaningful progress"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Watch out with this app! I cancelled my membership on April 27th, a while before it was supposed to charge. Have the cancellation email still. This morning I wake up to an alert that my account has been overdrawn due to them still charging me. I submit a refund request because I shouldn't have been charged, and they say it can take up to ten days! So now, because of them, I'll be getting overdraft fees."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's actually great but way overpriced so will not go past the free trial as it is not within my budget. Editing my review: it didn't come across clear that there was a free version of it, however upon trying to cancel I ended up getting a great deal which was only 2.99 a month, much more affordable!! I think it has less features, not clear on that, but it has everything I need and everything I used on the free trial as far as I can tell. Loving it! I'd love if it was on the Samsung Watch!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app is good, a great idea in fact. But there's a problem, it shows me the subscription amount is 3.33 INR/ Month and when I went to subscribe, it was charging me 3000+ INR for the year."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying the story telling as you make progress. Best way to keep me on track is to make it entertaining, and so far I like this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've gotten so much out of Fabulous. It guides me to care for myself for its own sake. Not to lose weight, or accomplish goals...just embracing the value of me. It's definitely helping me to chip away at the feeling I had that I was unworthy of being loved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A fun way to build healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Super cute and kept me motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice quality of free content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They want to automatically start charging after the free trial and phrase it as making my life easier. And it's not one month but a whole year. That's a straight up no from me whether the app is good or not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A little pricy for premium, but this is by far the best habit building tool out there"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this beautiful app!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Mama of 4 with no time for self care"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great site, beautiful layout and nice feel. Graphics are superb,"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I give it 5 starts because not only is it very useful but because of Fabulous my grades and hygiene have been going up lately ! I'm not missing any assignments due to this up and it is very helpful to me and my future! I don't think words can describe how good it is!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great, but there are so many premium tools that a poor like me can't use :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"There is a good sense of reward and progress as you go through with plenty of space to customise to the habits you want to improve on. With a nice, presentable UI."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I5 helps build up my knowledge and self discipline it is amazing how i can organize my routines. Fabulous is a life saver"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a helpful app to get you motivated and on the right track personal growth! So glad I discovered it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful! This app will help you reinforce some great new healthy habits. Teach you about self-reflection, growth, change your mindset and also provide you with new and innovative ways in order to be successful. Ultimately, you will feel much happier in life. Would definitely recommend it. Thank you, Fabulous! üíú"

This App Offers So Many Options Going About Doing Just That. Let Us All Get Back To Making Ourselves Priority One! That is When We will See The World Begin To Change For The Better Indeed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Shocked how bad it is. Seem like they make their money by making it infuriatingly difficult to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice I really enjoy it..üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like it so far and am contemplating buying full version for premium features. Edit: And upon reading other reviews, I'm thankful I didn't try the free trial. Looks like alot of people consistently having an issue with cancelling it. And being charged the full amount on the 7th day of the 7 day trial. I'm not willing to give money to or support an app that's going to send people in circles for trying to get their hard earned money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was prompted to fill out payment info, then the subscription did not show on the app store. Canceling the account is proving to be very difficult. $39.99/year is the ONLY payment option, and thats preditorial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well made and a good companion"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me build small habits that really affect my long term goals. If you like checklists and feeling encouraged/motivated...this is the app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As the app name, it's a fabulous one to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app will steal $40 from you without allowing you to get a refund. It was literally half of what I had left in my bank account üôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing at setting up healthy new habits. I use it everyday and love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun and interesting üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app (turns out I was using it wrong)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Sorry, I already drink a lot of water and I alredy own a water bottle. Why does your app assume I don't?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Updated review: Helped in the beginning. But the app is simply too overwhelming & STRESSFUL because of the amount of notifications (some that have nothing to do with your routine building). Furthermore, it is close to impossible to cancel your subscription. Sending an email gets you an automated response that guides you on contacting them. But all methods lead to other bots, so you are not able to get in contact with the company to delete your account. What a sad shame."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Motivating app. It is very calming and keeps you on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"How can I unsubscribe? Please, somebody, help me! It's not displayed in PlayStore subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is very helpful and I like it a lot but some stuff you can't add to your routine and that is what I don't like but I recommend it but as I said it is not that good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is super simple to use and has helped me create small habits to lead a better lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the trial wanting an app that would help me build a routine of the things that are actually important to me because I have a problem staying focused on my goals. What I got was a blasting of 'inspirational' notifications and a contract to drink water that I didn't fulfil, so couldn't progress. The random pricing scheme left me feeling ripped off and gross. Just have a clear price for your product and stick with it, don't beg me not to cancel with a discount."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Edit: been more than a month after I sent a report on the website and no one has contacted me about a refund. Charged me after I unsubscribe and their reimbursement form you have to attach a photo and it doesn't work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helped me with my daily tasks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful for me. I have trouble rembering to follow through for more that a few days, but this app has helped me feel better about trying to get back on track after I forget. I love the art style and graphics as well, just all in all amazing for the right people!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Update: 01/30/2022 So, they followed up, and corrected my issue. Once they actually got back to me it was very quick and easy. The app itself is ""Fabulous"", but its not for me Update: 04/25/2022 After leaving my review I received an email. I followed the instructions and still have heard nothing back from them. So far, I am really not impressed with their customer service. I want a refund! Awful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Annoying! I downloaded this for fun as I don't really need it but I feel for the people that do. You download it, tell it everything you want to chance and what not then it makes you feel all good just to hit you with the monthly subscription üòÇ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really is changing my life, and helping me build better habits and showing me the right path. I highly recommend this to anyone that is having a hard time breaking unhealthy cycles, or even just having a hard time building a healthy routine. It has helped me so much already!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth 40 dollar a month"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app for creating and maintaining good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"waste of time. shady business practices."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cookie cutter solutions dont work for everyone.. silly stories and metaphors distract from the tasks at hand. Just started getting annoyed by the constant notifications. Rather delete it and coach myself. I wasted $60 , hopefully you don't."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app throws so many notifications at you that have nothing to do with the habits. You have to manually click the x on each one, and they'll take up the top half of the screen until you do so. This makes me not want to use the app since I can't control what's spamming me. Also the annual subscription is too expensive for this overly flowery app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Personally, the app is way over hyped and it's a waste of money. I enjoyed it at first during the trial, thought it was a bit too rigid, but it might improve over time. By the time I got Premium i realised I made a mistake. It started to annoy me more over time, and I used it only because I paid for it. As someone who has done Cognative Behavioural Therapy and a bit of Acceptance and Commitment therapy, you would be better of purchasing a book for beginners rather than buying Premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"1GB for app like this is too much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't like the app, so I deleted it, and never used it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"New to fabulous premium. I just upgraded because it seemed well worth it at $3.33 a month, of course a one-time payment of $35ish ... But that's for the whole year. I'm hoping to get better at navigating around this thing! But It's not the apps fault, the more you do something the better you get at it, which is what this app tries to instill in you, so far so good but like I said I'm new, so I'm still stuck in my old ways of being extremely procrastinatory! But this app is, Rightfully Named! üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app provide amazing protocol and motivated thought and guide well .. I am used this app and tottaly change my bad habit .. Thanks.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I give this app a 5 star it's very user friendly. The animation are very well done. The apps do make a difference in daily life for getting use to new and good habits. I thank the team who developed this app. Very well designed. Keep up the good job."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has helped me out with my daily life and I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its really good and it keeps me motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Legit charged me even though I cancelled the free trial on time. This app is not worth it and I'm all about wellness and such. Also it's pretty female-geared and too cutesy for my taste. Just honestly get yourself a good journal app on your phone and sweet your own reminders to drink water. Really not my jam. And $40 for basically any thing available of worth on the app? Nah. I pay for premium apps regularly and wouldn't be upset if it was worth it. It's not imo. Maybe it works for you..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great UX, the information provided for each healthy habit is really helpful! Also, the story and its animations for each step of the journey are very interesting and entertaining and will encourage you to continue on your Fabulous journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The graphics and the sounds, that go with them are a nice way to be greeted. Great app which gently gives you tools to motivate and inspire. As a therapist, I see the value in recommending this to clients and colleagues."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App suscks won't let me stop payment"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its amazing ü§© i of course say that u have to download it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is an out and out fraud! I simply wanted to look thru the app but before I knew it I was ""enrolled"" in a 7 day free trial. It then become virtually impossible to cancel with no means of doing so. Because of this I am currently disputing the charge of $39.99 with my credit card's help. Company in question is based in France and unreachable. Google Play should remove this SCAM App from their store, asap!!! But don't take my word for it... plenty of other one star reviews!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's bad app not only because it's not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"UPDATE!!! And as you can see below, they will not refund anyone even if you do not use the app, they can see by my account and activity I didn't use it!! Wish I could give 0 or negative stars!! Very shady! I uninstalled it after a few days. After clicking on the Premium Subscription button in the app and nothing happened and no information on any plan or subscription showed up I checked Play for any subscription and nothing was there. Like any app with recurring charges that's where you look. A number of days later I was charged $40 in PayPal for this! I had to Google and spend 15min researching how to contact them to cancel & 16 days later no reply! Beware if you don't want to pay!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been doing it for almost a week and it's been a real positive motivator for my days. Especially when I'm at a low point it the little encouragement and reminders get me back on track. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very cute and useful so far. Changed some habits for the better after a few days, but I've only used it for a few days so early to say."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very usefull with high quality drawings and guides"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Positive app to keep you on track to making better choices fir a healthy living. Only gave 4 star because a lot of the options you have to pay for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A little confusing at first, but once you lay down initial habits, it is a great motivator"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The idea behind the app is good and I like the interface however there are two main problems. 1. Sometimes you get a notification to do an activity, but if for some reason, you want to switch apps for a minute, this activity has disappeared. 2. More important: cancelling the premium subscription is a very convoluted process that you can only follow on the web version, not the app. Logging in is not simple. And it doesn't appear on GooglePlay under subscriptions. I'm still trying to cancel!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever used. I wish i had started using fabulous when i first found out about it. It helps me to focus, prioritize and stick to life changing habits i had always wished i could cultivate but never really managed on my own! I highly recommend app for any one who needs help reorienting their lives - really anyone!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First of all Nothing is loading second I literally have to wait 20 mins for wait to it to load and third of all im still waiting for it and i just got it!! You guys really need to fix this APP!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it alot helps me out alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps alot in your lifeü§©ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A very great app which enhances your self discipline"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Told I was signing up for free 30 day pass but then was charged. I haven't even used the app. I have received so many emails saying FREE 30 day pass. So why am I being charged after 1 day?? I can't even check out the app bc I have submitted for a refund but was told I don't qualify. There stupid auto bot won't even hear my issue. I am not happy at all. I was looking forward to check this app out but not anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Even though I've only been doing these routines for about two days now, they have really changed my perspective of myself and helped me to realize how important the little things can be. I wish that the initial free trial lasted longer than 1 week but it's worth putting in the effort even for that short amount of time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Enjoying so far easy simple tasks with lots of explanation and understanding though don't like constant prompts for feedback especially when only a few days in .. will update after longer use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this because I'm so loiyn"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was very enthusiastic and excited starting out and read their tips and everything but I quickly got turned off and now ward resentment towards the app. It suggested (I kid you not) to ""drink water"" when I get up and when I did it asked me to pat myself on the back while playing sound effects like a music box. I may be an older millennial but I'm all grown up now and I don't need this type of patronizing validation. I uninstalled it so now where's my participation award?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great concept, and has been helpful. I just often miss the notifications, wish they were louder or something. I need a couple weeks of not missing the reminders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged falsely. Exceedingly difficult to unsubscribe"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app makes it impossible to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great motivation tool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"First of all I feel like I was tricked into buying a 1 year premium membership. I only wanted the free trial period. What seemed like a button to activate my account was a button to subscribe to premium. I only realized that when I saw 30+ EUR fly out of my account. Secondly, the premium cancelation process is extremely tedious with many annoying ""are you sure"" steps. It is not possible to be done from the app but only from the browser. Very cunning money grabbing tactics that pissed me off..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I personally had no motivation to get back in shape some before boot camp but this app changed that I'm only 2 days in while I sent this but it helps so much and I have a smile now thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Stop offering guest passes to premium members like 3 times a day. Extremely annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, it's been rewarding üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app... And recommend to everyone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was terribly disappointed when I found out this does not sync across devices. I like to use it on my phone when I'm on the go but at home I want to use it on my tablet but with two separate profiles makes this impossible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful for those who want to improve their lifestyle and mental health. The user interface is fantastic, also the content. Routines are highly customisable and there are plenty of programs to choose. Highly recommended!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app to help encourage good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy way to pick up routines without stressing yourself out about it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's highly expensive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Very useful, but use a lot of mobile data by default"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time, they just want your money. They will charge you even if you cancel before the free trial ends, and then they tell you to contact the support on their page and they never respond. They don't even deserve 1 star, this is a complete fraud. Be careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good idea, too expensive. I love the idea behind this app, don't get me wrong. But as others have mentioned, it's too expensive and everything genuinely useful and intriguing is a paid feature. I ended up just taking what I learned doing the first journey, and using as a basis for my own manual habit tracking and growth, and finding a different app to give me little bits of encouragement and seratonin throughout the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing. & I just started it. Absolute must-have"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Gave bad vibes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever used"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it has been way more fun then I thought it would be. Little hard to navigate around the app but there is some much good stuff here"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful app I really enjoy the paid version. However, the noise/music that sounds when I mark a task complete is so outrageously loud. It is very irritating, especially after the rather quiet voice recordings, the music level is incomparable. Please fix this ü•∫ edit 2022-04 I restarted my challenges 5 days ago. i think starting anew will give me more chances to succeed on all the challenges. The focus is on continuous streaks. if one day is missed, the challenge resets, consistency is key!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use, it helps to make a healthy routine which has helped me with my studys and my health. Really recommend this App!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its appalling that while people could really use apps like this to better themselves, they can't truly be successful unless they pay for it. Boo. Don't waste your time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the sounds when i click everything I would say this is my type of sounds..soo happy!!‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Never received any communication regarding my refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to change your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Enough things have annoyed me about this app for me to stop my rating. Still helpful enough to be worth using for me, at least for the time being."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I feel like this app might help me to start some healthy habits, that I wasn't able to start by myself. I love those little moments of learning and reflection it provides. Great overall so far. (3 week)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Instantly uninstall due to payment requierment ! Next time say its a payed app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would give 0 stars if possible. Despite cancelling before the end of the free trial period I was still charged ¬£35. I have sent several messages and received no response. Contact / complaint information is so difficult to find within the app / website which I believe is intentionally done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful would recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using Fabulous for a few months now and it has definitely improved my quality of life. Thats not to say it was easy or a magic pill; with all self improvement, you get out what you put in. Same goes here. But if you are willing to put in the work, I think Fabulous is a great place to start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app had made me a bit more productive. When I installed this app I thought it would help me plan my schedule and keep me on track. Well now I know it does that and also gives some challenges to do so you feel better and do better. This help us and our surroundings sometimes. It's a great app to help with other things too. I would recommend this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a amazing appal.If you add salahh(muslim prayers)it would be more nice.Please consider it.Purple Uüíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"When I do the stuff it want to to do a trial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks for helping me to change my behaviour ü•∞üòäüíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it, wouldnt let me cancel paid a full year for nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Garbage app makes you fill the forms first and then tells you to pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Behaviour-based? Total lack of control. Annoying, gimmicky intro of graphics and music that can't be bypassed. Immediately drops you into questions, without explaining what's going on. No controls. No ""Back"" button. No configuration or settings. I got as far as the second question this time. I'm incredulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Life changing, really helpful app. Full of insights on how to create habits and change your behaviour one step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to track your habits, a lot of information with scientific facts and hep you to get organized and motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me navigate healthy habits for life step by step. I recommend this app for those who struggle with self growth. Might not be the perfect app for you but definitely is the one worthy of giving a try!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty impressive! I'm just under two weeks in. I have ADHD and got used to thinking I'm bad at healthy changes. But this one is working for me. I'm trying not to think about it too hard so my brain can't get in the way. üòÖ They make it easy to do that. I think that's why it's working. It's visually lovely and affirming, gentle, and motivating. And as someone with ADHD, I'm just about the most sensitive case for those characteristics. Definitely worth a try, including the premium version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's very difficult to cancel your free trial or subscription. Even if you follow the directions laid out in their own terms of service, you get bounced around - emailing them (as directed in the ToS) gives you an automated email to go to the website Contact Us page, using that bounces you to the app, and so on. It's predatory. Avoid using this app, there's other better, more transparent alternatives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Slow incremental change, I'm only on day 2 but this app is keeping me hopeful that I can change for the better Round 2, this app is a blessing, First few days of yoga left me aching throughout the day but now I just feel strong and ready. I'm also loving falling into the book I'm reading and having checks to go back to really keeps me on track"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hard to get started...stay with it and it will be easier. Fabulous is helping me with becoming a better person..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Great Life changes. Boost in energy and enthusiasm. Started to accomplish my main dream, Smile alot more now. Look forward to a another day. Love the reminder ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Clunky , even paid app gives me ads . I would not recommend it at all ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am so happy with the app! It's made me a morning person.. And I used to take a minimum of 2 hours to get out of bed! It's really useful in building the small habits and pushes me to be consistent!! The psychology behind is great and very spot on, it shows that the creators have put an immense amount of time to research. The UX is absolutely fabulous and I can't wait to see the new animation stories."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I would love more information with some of the options you can choose but other than that I really enjoy it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Monthly option would have kept me. It was the 12 month lump payment that lost me. If I could of paid the 2.98 a month I would have kept it but the 39 was too much to pay in one go."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This is not an app for everyone; it really depends on your temperament and how much attention you need from an app. However, if you enjoy science-based learning in a cute software package, this can work for you to develop new habits. I enjoyed it for a month or so, and actually stuck with one positive habit (taking vitamins), but then it got on my nerves. Too many repetitive inspirational quotes, too many cutesy graphics, too much app ""management."" I uninstalled it and unsubscribed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me encouraged and accountable to make better self-care/self-love choices in my lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm sticking with it. It's been 3 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app really does help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Set small or detailed routines for a peaceful day. That's what I'm doing with the app to help me recover from a major episode of Autism Breakdown following a complete life change in Feb 2020 (moved & stopped working to focus on failing health & marriage) The Covid Years, Gut tanked with lots of mess, Lost all my teeth, Cancer Scare (blessed it wasn't cancer), right kidney removed, hospital stay, hard recovery, just shy of needing a hospital from stress, fainting spells & more. TY Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Right now its perfect. Only reason im not giving five stars is that for example they would put actual breakfasts which you can do yourself. Small thing but otherwise pretty good!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabolous is amazing!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Exactly what I needed. Actually feeling much better about myself and my journey. Well worth the experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app help me a lot in my routine, I'm depressed of what to do and this app help me through."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's okay so far but it doesn't let me go back to change my answers and for some reason it won't let me get premium... It's saying that my phone is not online..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app even though I do have troubles with finishing the routines but this app does not judge you for that it actually helps you to get into your actual pace of getting that routine done! This is a wonderful app I love it I love the music I love the way they do things and five stars absolutely!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very cool stuff, helpful, really enjoying it. However, I wish there was an option to start with different journeys. I need this kind of thing in my life, but I already drink so much water and eat a good breakfast. The default habits should vary more or allow flexibility."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Unusual :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really liked it, it's motivating and that is cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app it is .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great for me, it is helping me build structure for myself. My future self will thank me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You can't cancel the annual subscription after the trial. At least, it isn't easy and I don't think it's a coincidence. It's a 40 ‚Ç¨ steal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far so good nothing I can complain about.... will comment again in 3 months see how I feel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is very motivational and helpful to plan your journey to live healthier. I would recommend this if you have some unhealthy things (such as: no sleep) on your mind. :) Edit:However I would reccomend a better app layout to make things more accessible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"THE BESTüëçüíØ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is very well built, the free version has of course less features then the paid one but overall for a free app with no ads it has way more featutes then it's counterparts."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An amazing app which has opened my mind and git me tryjbg new things, love what it has given me this far and can't wait to see more progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The first week, I didn't believe this app would work. By the 3rd week, I see a lot of promise if I stick with it. It's pretty motivational. I would recommend it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app so far only problem is the time settings were off and my alarm went off at the wrong time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been about two weeks of using it, and I'm loving it so far. I feel encouraged to keep improving myself step by step. I think the whole step by step, go at your own pace way of self improvement feels more sustainable long-term. Already paid for the premium because I think this is going to be so helpful for me :)))"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the ambient music that plays in-between checking off my task list! Worry fades + focus improves. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Being accountable as I'm making small changes has made a huge shift for me. I find myself integrating change more easily and the pattern interrupt has allowed other areas of my life to shift for the better. I love the daily passages to read or listen to. I find them very calming and they nourish me on a mental, emotional and spiritual level. Thank you Fabulous for creating this gem !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me very much because usually i forget to drink water and i dont exercise at all sometimes, but it helped me not forget and exercise. Great app! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I've had this app before (paid version). Seemed to be more beneficial as the free version ... I'm giving it another shot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I've ever used. It's helped me so much. I love that it has coaching every morning and night but I think of it as a kindness motivation. I recommend to everyone. I'm happier, more motivated, I am actually being kinder to everyone and most importantly to myself. I am losing weight and it reminds me to do the little things and when you start your day with the little things you up eventually want to do more but the app also reminds you not to do too much which is very helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent app to change your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app if you tend to forget things or need to manage your day in a gamified manner.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love The Directional Advice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its great and all but its annoying to pay for a membership like I came here to build healthy habits not to be stopped by 39.99 a month"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great Accountability, it's enjoyable to see my progress! Gentle and yet Not annoying reminders to do better....I feel super and awesome üòé!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It stuck after type email üò°üò°üì® Why is it happen I think this app is good but it stuck.üò• Why why why I see someone id in her account this app she used to say that this will help and guide you but it didn't work üòïüòë"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it's really engaging, seems to be delivering results, well laid out and intuitive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app could be so amazing, but I'm so frustrated with the lack of ability to run challenges or journeys alongside each other. The Fabulous say that this is intentional to allow you to focus on one thing at a time, but (e.g.) the morning journey and a deep work challenge are completely unrelated, and I am so frustrated that I've paid ¬£35 for this app and I'm being dictated to about which habits I want to incorporate into my life. If this gets sorted I'll up my rating, but for now: 3/5."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and motivates me too do things like drink water and go for walks just the simple things help with mental health , you can journal and do mindfulness I 100% reccomend downloading this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so good. I have been building good habits since 2 weeks and I can see improvement in me, and that's all because of Fabulous. Such a wonderful daily routine app. I have been using it from 3 weeks or so and I absolutely love it. Thank you Fabulous for making me amd my day feel better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its osm ‚ú®üëåüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app gives me great vibes!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Everything is toward the premium subscription. Times are hard right now and people can't afford to pay for things like subscriptions at the moment. I'm trying to better myself which is why I downloaded the app. Sadly I'm disappointed that the free features are few and every button or message is about premium. I love the concept of the app and I wish I could use it more. I just don't have the funds for the premium experience....Thank you for listening."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Only accepts sign in with Google account, but I like to keep accounts separate. Deleted before chance for testing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As a scientist I can say that it uses scientific principles wisely."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's not magic but they try steal your money legal don't try the free trail u can't almost not cancel it again"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing work, it feels very personalised and is a great way to improve yourself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app you don't have to pay if you don't want but there are bigger opportunities when done I am in love it has helped my with a daily routine and it's helped my mental heath. The community really understands and appreciate u please try it out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The registration process was kinda confusing if you do it on you PC instead on mobile but otherwise the app is good and it helped me organize my schedule quite well. Helped my wellbeing too, a smart idea :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Sounds great, but then you are after payment information before the work has actually begun. Show value first, then ask for compensation. You are saying I will be feeling better in 14 days, so prove that. Also, I got a higher price the second time I was asked for payment. Punishment for not doing it the first time is not a good motivator."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app if only that they didn't charge to certain parts of the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is a great help with getting into a good routine, it starts you off with one simple task and reminds you to do it every day. There is also groups you can join that are very supportive and open. The whole experience has been great!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have the free version and its amazing I can do alot and plus it take your goals step by step"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fun cool inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Just got the app, and my first task is to drink water when I wake up. It's Ramadan at the moment, and I'm fasting so I can't do that lol. Will be able to in a week tho. Consider adding a feature to help with situations like this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous app üëçüèª it helps you change alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helping me organise things better. Happy with the progress so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've NEVER had Anything Help like Fabulous üíú I've gotten 30 Day free passes when I tick an accomplishment and shared on Facebook, Messenger and even texts. I couldn't Reccomend an app an higher. I now drink water every day I wake up. My Journeys come with nightly, beautiful audio along with stories that I have no idea how they created the movements are beyond beautiful. THIS IS AN APP I WON'T QUIT, IT'S CALMING AND AT A PACE THAT'S CALMING AS WELL. I LOVE YOU FABULOUS üíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My back account been charged by fabulous and they have no clear contact to help resolve this issue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I wish there were more features without premium. Other than that, it is delightful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not an easy layout.. Too many options add ons"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is good app üëç for so many things we can do üòá"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So much fun!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I experienced a few glitches but nothing serious, but worth taking note of."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Some good information but good grief! Every 10 minutes there are pop ups asking you to commit to something you've agreed to 10 times over. It's relentless. I'm sure it's helpful for some people. I found it way too much for me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Tried this app and it wasn't for me, months later I just got a random charge from them on my card when I had canceled everything and deleted it. I have done as you requested and filled out the refund form. Fingers crossed you guys are on top of it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious notifications , and difficult to cancel subscription even though it repeatedly says it's easy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great concept/idea; just falls a bit short on the execution. Improvements seem to be in process, however-- we shall see what comes of this app. [Either way, the responsiveness of the development team is reassuring. Thank you!!]"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great and helpful. (Edit: typo)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried this app and realized it wasn't for me. Uninstalled, canceled and moved on. Now over a month later and I see charges for $40 on my credit card. This feels super shady."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever downloaded"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app really helps me maintain habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's ok"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"How I can cancel this please"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A beautiful app with some hiccups. The current for me is suddenly having a lot of titles translated into German language (probably because I'm in Germany?), without any option to select / change the language within the app. The help documentation suggests altering an android setting that does not exist then redownload everything! This is really annoying as I didn't change anything and the app is now mix of German and English! I hope this stops otherwise the app will become useless. Please help!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing Honestly I would totally recommend this app for someone who wants new goals and to set some habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just so nice!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great ‚ò∫Ô∏è app to maintain the habits but it ask us to upgrade to get the awesome features it has that very annoying if the can ad an ad option we will be happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's trash. They will charge you to be your friend and help with your problems woow. Thanks no need for such paid helps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have uninstalled the app 2 days after installing it. However about 9 days after I can see Fabulous has tried to charge me for ¬£34.99 and again, a second time just today. Please, remove all details you have from me from your database and do not try to request any more payments. Thanks, Antonella"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I uninstalled the app because when I got to the end of filling out all the information it showed a 7 day trial for free and then a monthly payment plan. This information should be at the beginning I didnt continue with the rest of the sign up as I want more information about the app and what it does before I hand over credit card details. As there was no way to go back and delete information that i entered and no one to contact i want to unsubscribed from the program."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Day 1 & so far so good. Let's see what the future holds."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why does everything today need to be a subscription?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is fun and colorful and very user-friendly. It's helping me establish a daily routine, and to find my creativity and motivation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"GREAT... NOTHING IN MY LIFE IS BETTER THAN THIS APP RIGHT HERE"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"At first the app seems slow with all the questions asked; once you start to follow the journeys you start to see changes. Helps me stay uplifted and focused through out the day. Also when I forget to do a journey I think about it, which is good,especially if it involves cleaning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Out of this world"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The start was super overwhelming, all the questions with only a few answer choices, and expecially the contract part that said ""I will not live forever"" this app is supposed to help not cause more trouble."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's truly worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good if you need a reminder to help you establish good habits and UI is bright and interactive and the goal checkpoints hit all the right dopamine circuits would reccomend"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. It changed my life from negative to positive ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving this so far. Much better then any other habit tracking app I've used before. Builds you up slowly and sustainably. Will come back and change this rating depending on how well it works in the long term!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just in love with this from day one!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me focus, sleep, and complete goals and tasks in a unique way. Never thought signing a contract w myself would help me stay on track lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a beautiful app to make you beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, Thank you is all i can say .I hate the fact you have to pay for this but i understand that that is their way of making bank and I'm not too mad about it.I think that for the first time in a while I have disconnected more out of my bad habits of not taking care of myself and connected more with books, studying or even spending time with my family! You get a first week free and I totally recommend this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is designed for success and change, I love it. However if not ready don't waste your time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super awesome worth the money great for enfp personality types like myself to getting organized"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app! It provides that little extra bit of motivation to get things done!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"WONDERFUL."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fabulous figuratively and literally! I love the accountability from the app to help create better or healthy habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Better options. lag and design Is for kids of 5 years"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome for helping you build habits and incorporating them into your morning, afternoon and evening routines!!! Very easily customizable!! 2nd review;; still easy to use and they've added a lot more things to it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I feel as though the app could be good, but it's far too clunky and overwhelming with all the tasks, letters, notifications etc. I just want something simple that will keep me on track. Paradox of choice comes to mind."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Looked at the reviews and found out it's basically a scam!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If i could give this an eight , i would this app is amazing ! I tried it for 10 dAyz nd i lobse it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. There is pros and cons bit in general it's a great app. I would like that it would be possible to choose the time and alarm for each task. That would make easier to plan. Otherwise I found a lot of good things in new journey to better and healthy me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I wrote a one star review about how Fabulous is a scam product, counting on you to forget to cancel your trial and I got a reply saying that they make cancelation easy (implying it was my fault for not canceling). THAT IS A LIE. In the app you have to go through several sub-menues to find how to cancel your subscription and then it directs you to their website! It seems rather obvious that Fabulous does everything in its power to make it hard to cancel. Obvious dishonesty. Clearly a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The coaching is very inspirational but also original and not cookie cutter. I look forward to hearing it and sharing it with others."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"no one ever said that i have to sign up for a subscription but after you enter your details email etc they tell you why? so they can spam your email trying to get you to come back but luckily Gmail has a ""block"" option great! thanks Google!!!!!!! tried to delete my review yah? it's easier for me to resubmit it mf you can't easily stop me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is as same as its name. It is really good to motivate you and make you work to in a very appealing way. For me it's very ""FABULOUS"". Thanks üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really wanted to try this. I procrastinated. I got through the intro questions and the things I'm interested in. I got busy and closed the app. It did not save my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not paying for this Sh$%"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good app for focusing, self-care, reaching goals, meditation & practicing gratitude"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I am trying to cancel the free trial and I can't see how to do it,they certainly don't make it easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love itt plus this beautiful app has so many inspiring and sweet words for people‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think its a great app if you're wanting to really commit to change. I gave 4 stars because having to buy the whole year at a time versus monthly subscriptions was kind of lame."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Iam new to this app and a yet to explore more. So far happy. Not a premium member ,still I think it offers great opportunity for growth"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been searching all the places I could, to get to find a new character of me and I couldn't, but with this app that I found I realized it was possible and now I'm enjoying myself and my life with meaningful moments and things, so I give it a 5 star to both the app itself and the persons who developed it, I totally recommend it to anyone."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm a self help junkie. So I had to play around to find new habits that would help me. Its a fun app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A beautiful app with a simple but effective interface that helps you to organize your goals and focus on doing them, and that can include stopping certain bad habits too. The app may not be for you if you want the motivation to begin, but rather jump-start you and guide you on your way to fulfil your destiny. Highly recommended and already made me more positive and encouraged me to go behind my dreams. Great coaching with a fantastic community and interesting groups."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It downloaded then it just frozed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Actually get excited to check it out throughout the day. Seemingly infinite amounts of resources."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You have charged my bank account for an annual subscription despite my cancelling it. Please advise how this can be resolved."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This company is a fraud. Signed up for the 30 day trial and was charged after about 5 days. Have reached out to support to do the right thing twice now to no response. I will be opening a fraud investigation with my bank over this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous! I love it though the first few tasks I already do I'm excited to see the rest. Animations and stories are awesome and not like any other app and cannot wait to achieve more üòä I have the subscription but let's be real apps need to make there money and all depends on how much you want use the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is a good app and helps build positive habits. However if you disable the alarms you will continually encounter prompts to re enable them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Skip it.. nearly impossible to cancel. The app refers you to their website but then their website shows no Link to access your profile or manage your subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the special attention to my needs!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"PLEASE reconsider the pricing. this app looks great, but i'll never know how it works. forty bucks for a lifetime script would be pushing it--but as a subscription price?? that's utterly unfeasible to many of the people this could help the most"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst experience with customer service. After being allowed to ""cancel"" the trial through Google play, I was still charges because they said it wasn't an app sign up. Even though the subscription was cancelled on that day, they REFUSE to refund the charge, even despite not sending any kind of reminder and having a faulty app set up which allows users to believe they have cancelled their trial through the app, when in fact it has to be done online. Run away! It's definitely not worth the money!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"3rd time I'm writing a 1 star review so this is FRAUD. Charged me in spite of telling them not to, on time. Fraud, theft, calling Google about this thief. UPDATE, APRIL 18, 2022 They keep charging me, and today when I AGAIN asked for not to charge me and to get a refund, I got this belligerent answer from 'Andrew ;: Hello! Thank you for contacting the Simple app support team. I'm Andrew, and I'll be helping you today. According to our system, you've been charged because you didn't cancel your subscription. Please note, we always provide information on our website regarding subscription renewals being automatic - we provide this during sign-up.

Remember, we're always here to help. Have a lovely day and take care, üòá Andrew Simple Team ----- EVERYONE, CONTACT GOOGLE PLAY AND ASK THEM TO REMOVE THESE THIEVES FROM THE SYSTEM."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"All the notifications are not so helpful. It makes it easy to ignore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience, thanks!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using for around a week but I really do enjoy it. I like a challenges how it's not demanding or forceful. I feel like it's bringing up thoughts, feelings, or techniques. I've never heard of use before and I'm finding helpful if not interesting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Beautiful app, but if you don't want to stay glued to your phone, you're screwed. For anyone that doesn't mind lots of screen time, and who doesn't mind starting on extreme fundamentals -this is for you. Can't sidestep or skip tasks that you already regularly do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Im starting to feel better with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's great as a whole, just a bit out of budget for me for the full experience. Love the simple reminders and positive messages"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Please add an option to buy the premium one time if anyone cannot buy in installments. Every other things are fine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has definitely helped me implement a morning routine which is helping my mental wellbeing üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"They make it so annoying to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving all the features in this app so far! Cant wait to see all the other things it has to offer but for now, it's amazing!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"GAME CHANGER"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,":] you did a good job fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Can't use the free trial unless you pay $40 for the subscription first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"My coaching sessions are no longer working. I have payed for the premium and can't get my coaching. When I go to do my routines it will not give me the option to listen to the coaching. Please help. My routines have been out of wack these past few days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it makes my day easier and manageable leading a productive day. Now I wake up earlier than usual, I'm physically fit. I stay hydrated. Ilove myself more. I recommend using fabulous to be fabulous. If you're finding the better you then this app is definitely for you. Love this thank you fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling. Won't even let me set it up. Cannot click the continue button. It's grayed out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You should tell people they have to end up paying for it first why have a free download but you have to pay to use it for more than a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have verification in my email that my account that I cancelled my account, but my my credit card was still charged. There seems to be a error between the Play Store and Fabulous. Please fix this and refund my card. I tried the contact through your website, which was not helpful in this matter."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started but I am drinking more water. I am getting more of a routine down. Also, reflecting on how I am holding myself back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When I went to sign up, the app let me sign up for premium then never actually let me sign in on the app or connect my premium account. I contacted support and never got a response from them, so I just cancelled my account and accepted the loss of $40."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeping me on Track. Enjoying using this app allowing me to start creating healthy habits. More of an empowering tone than other apps I have used in the past. Definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"When I'm following fabulous I do feel a little better and I do set my goals small to get them done. I also enjoy the coaching I get from fabulous . I do like the way they let youmake some of your own goals that fits you and yourself . Being old and diabetic and high blood presure their are things I can't do but you have helped me throught them. So I' m getting better at things just very slow.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really helping me set up for success. The routines and advice are easy to follow. The way everything is laid out and explained makes me feel like change is actually reachable. Great for someone serious about taking the steps to a deeper, happier life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Spent 5 mins to fill up a quiz about me for nothing? You should have said at the beginning it costs ¬£35 annual subscription so we would consider filling up the details if we are happy with the price. You cannot quit from the app at that moment as back button does not work, it forces you to press continue to 7 days trial, very dirty way of earning money I must say. How do I know whether I'm subscribed now?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply incredible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great motivator"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's good, and quite satisfying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app it seemed good when I downloaded. I tryed to cancel during the first week. This app brought me more problems with my bank account. So now I am in vacation and struggling to pay or transfer my money because of this app. The bank blocked my card. Until I found accidentally on gmail somehow, I didn't even knew it. Very bad experience. If I want to cancel at least charge for a month not a year. Plus I need to go back to open a new account, to change documents for my salary etc. Cheating."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I think it's fabulous. Helps me a great deal ro get through the day and the customer service is just Impeccable. I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I don't like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great üòÄüòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I purchased the premium package because I thought this was a great idea. Still do, however, I immediately had to uninstall because I started getting pop up ads and web pages taking over my phone! I would like you to stop trying to charge my card immediately!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I got double charged and no response. I contacted them and have yet received any response. Please be careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I still can believe you still have to pay for app when the app can be free fully with ad's"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"To my surprise, this app actually works if you apply it and stick to it like I have. It helped me open doors and saw good possibilities that I never was able to see with my old self as if I was blindfolded. Coming across this Fabulous App and applying to it did change me as it is still doing so You have to be dedicated to yourself and committed. Days later it also encouraged me to try another related app (Noom) to support me on my journey as I became aware of my newly found good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a very helpful and motivating app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's a great idea behind it, but the amount of notifications it sends made me run away from my phone and each time I got a buzz I knew that it was fabulous and didn't even check. I wanted to get better at some routines, without listening to some stories 100x a day. I wanted a simple tick box to do simple stuff. The app also assumes that everyone procrastinates and while I personally have a bigger problem with doing too much rather than procrastinating, this lecturing was annoying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice sentiment but what part of behavioral science is hiding the cost of the app untill after your commitment?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app. Very motivating and encouraging and it's easy to use:enjoying the little challenges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love Fabulous. You can work it around your life to both improve it and generate more time. It really does help to improve your quality of life. The above was written by me in 2016. 6-years later, I am back to using it again and I think it is even better! I'm taking the journey slow and steady, not trying to overwhelm myself too much, and I think I'm benefitting more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good for my organisation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's certainly helping me with my depression."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been trying to create new habits for what seems like forever. Fabulous has been fabulous in helping me succeed. It's a lovely and creative app. I'm grateful for its existence."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very unhappy with this app. I tried to cancel my subscription before the 7 day free trial ended. The app said that the only way I could do this was to go through Google Play, who I sent two emails too and got no response. I want a refund and a want to cancel. How can I do this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I like the concept and the app. BUT, after hearing that it's difficult to cancel the payment, And while being broke at the same time. I'm out, one too many apps have stole money from me from a service that MIGHT work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"very best and useful app üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it. It helps me a lot. Very visually appealing as well as the sound effects. I enjoy using it. I hope it continues to get better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am now creating daily habits that I thought would be so hard. The app is like an accountability partner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ik ben echt heel blij met de app wat het kan doen met mijn mentaliteit. Ik voel echt wel de resultaat na een halve dag na installatie, met al de hulp die ik heb gekregen in de forum. Enige probleem voor mij is dat er geen berichtenbox is. Ik moet van de ene menu naar een ander menu gaan om de reacties te kunnen zien. Voor de rest echt een top app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I give 5 stars even i dont got credit card and money to pay the premium version but i need some help in my life now and some loveüéá so i'm very thankful for the little part of this app you giving me for freüéÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Could be better but I like the idea"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful. No its fabulous! I have been struggling with myself and my Performance but this app has been guiding and motivating me to challenge myself. I want to be more than what I have ever pictured myself to be. This app is definitely a starting path."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"been a few days but it's been nice to have a place to go when I need something positive to do for myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm having a difficult time cancelling the subscription. My trial ended and I've been charged. Been trying to rectify it, but the app says cancellation is only available on the website and there is no link on the page that leads to said cancellation page."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You are keeping me on track. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pulls you back into life's daily needs. I owe you guys one."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice and easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"üíî"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to help you build habits. Very customizable to your own needs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A week in and I can tell I'm on to something special."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app couldve been good if i didnt have to upgrade to premium for everything"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"You definitely need yo immerse yourself into the app in order to reap the benefits. Follow the story and continue to progress slowly it may take a vouple tries but you can do it as long as you keep opening it up every morning ü•∞"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For the start, it wasn't easy to avoid using a card - a sort of manipulative way I hate in apps. Unfortunately, the ""manipulative rather then explanatory"" approach continues throughout the quests. As far as you follow the ""happy path"", it's peachy. However, if you already have some routines working for you that you don't intend to change, app tries to impose a fake guilt on you or bids you to cheat its own mechanics. Also, newer research invalidates some postulates presented by the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I keep paying for ot cause its so worth it!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is very good but the premium cost too much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This feels like heaven üòå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App asks for a fingerprint in the beginning because ""it helps you commit."" Gaslighting people to get their data is not a moral business practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how it's so positive and it really changed they way I live."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only on Day 5. But this is what I've been looking for. For so very, very long."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Different than any other app I have used."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it so far. Still getting used to the notifications. Love the journaling feature most."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Am so angry with this up i hope no one ever download i did unsubscribe 2 times now and now they takw 39e from my card so so angry i hope i get full refund....biges mistake to supripe this app best of luck for the new ones"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Heard from asap science and so far I actually do really like it. I've tried other apps like finch and cts but this one for whatever reason has helped me engage and even add more habits to my day. Only been a week but I am feeling a bit more out of my shell and out of my funk. Everyday is a struggle to do anything new and this is easing me into the process in a gentle and calm way. No pressure. The meditations are really good and I like the writing programs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't used the app long enough to really know if it a robust 5 stars, but for the time I have used Fabulous- I've enjoyed it. Not everything is perfect, ofc, but they seem like good people trying to do good things for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app! Colourful animation and really simple small steps. Good talks too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app üíû"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unauthorized charges"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Money grabbing project. I am dumbfounded how they are legally allowed to let a user sign up for premium on the app, and then get the user to use their website to try and find how to cancel the membership. Having you 'sign a contract' with yourself to ensure you complete your goals (which is very valid psychology), but then they cling to the coat tails of this to ensure you keep paying them. Emotional blackmail at its finest. Avoid at all costs!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Coaching At your fingertips. I enjoy the fabulous app. It keeps me encouraged and eager to see what great words of wisdom it has to share. I never feel terrible or bad about myself if I miss a day. I know I'm human and today is a new day to love on myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I would recommend you to upload yhis app. It's life changing. I like the pace at which the program allows to change you daily habit. This is without any doubt one of the best üëå apps I have ever downloaded. Thank you to the creators"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's goodddd"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this so had been absolutely amazing. I love it, it's been really helpful for me and I love the beautiful art and stories. But I've only used it for two days so we'll see üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I intended to cancel the subscription but when submitting my request, but I am not able to submit my request or attached a screenshot of the receipt. I am not able to complete the refund request."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great and engaging, took a min. To get into but has so many great ""challenges"" and the circles are awesome to connect with other around your same goals interests and needs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The intent of the is smazing, love it. But they can make the more user-friendly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping all the way in my recovery after a deep recurring depression. I do not feel alone any more and I am constantly guided."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Already started changing habits. I quit drinking soda just by following the water routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Not very helpful unless you pay the yearly subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Encourages good, healthy habits in a way that feels super easy and manageable. I really don't feel like this app asks much of me, yet I can already see it making a difference. This app should be more famous than it currently is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is extremely beneficial towards creating long lasting healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an AWESOME app! It's comprehensive and allows me to focus on and tackle multiple daily goals...motivation and encouragement included. You can start wherever you are on your journey to better...Fabolous has a plan for that - and you! I'm excited to see what's to come!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2 weeks with it and Im seeing results with my depression and making small changes in my life, for the best. Loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One star for the very first start. Starting with such loud sound is unacceptable. It could happen in a quiet office, or at night near a sleeping child. please fix it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great! But the animation story suddenly stopped for me and now nothing is shown when I progress üòî Other than that, it's helped me get a great morning routine, I've made time where I thought there wasn't any üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I don't actually have a review, I just want to know how to delete the account. I've already cancelled my subscription, but how do I delete the account?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT !!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for self growth with very simple and innovative and intresting story"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greatest app ever for personality development. Amazing, excellent and it can definitely definitely improve your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"For me it's too cheesy and..""premium"". Just No. The UI itself is confusing at times"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great. The whimsical story like experience draws you into each step. Speaking on steps it walks you through everything in a timely manner as to not overwell10/10 great job and thank you developers"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I am now productive and not lazy anymore. I love the story in the app, it is so entertaining! I recommend it! !ùêëùêûùê¶ùê¢ùêßùêùùêûùê´! ‚òÄÔ∏éÔ∏éùë´ùíìùíäùíèùíå ùíòùíÇùíïùíÜùíì‚ô°Ô∏é"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, you can set your goals, unlearn and change your bad behaviour slowly and steadily, learn good habits and become a fabulous person who improve and progress each day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very interesting."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for setting good habits and excellent for mental health"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Despite the limitations and failure to notify it's a great habit building app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very creative, fun app. Keeps you on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, I tried Fabulous once and failed because I was looking for long term results using short term methods and expected I could do things the same way with Fabulous. On the second go, I was truly at my wits end. I could not live how I was living while maintaining harmony and happiness throughout the whole day. If you come into Fabulous ready to keep having miserable days, but also ready to slowly transform your lifestyle meaningfully, it will help and make you feel good about small steps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so cool it makes me more organised ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Oddly works, I'm still super skeptical, but i have noticed a marked improvement in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been sober for almost a year now and a lot of my sober people aren't very motivating. I felt I deserved structure and something to celebrate all the hard work I've done. I also suffer from physical and mental ailments and many days I am not motivated to do anything except go to work and sleep. Fabulous is helping me so much to be inspired to live a full and joy filled life. Thank you!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for habit development. As Aristotle said... ""Excellence is not an act, but a habit."""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful it's true small changes add up this app is cool"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just absolutely love it thank you fabulous daily routine planner staff your amazing and now I feel so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very confusing. First of all the app is really busy with lots of positive fluff and unnecessary animations of your journey. Secondly, before the trial of 7 days have even gone past day 1 you're offered a years membership for 39.99skr roughly 4 dollars but the confirmation from PayPal let me know that it's in fact roughly 40 dollars not 4! Quite a difference. Tried to unsub in the app, asked to go online where my account couldn't be found.. Took me 1 hour to unsubscribe! Don't recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Subskrypcja."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not effective for me. Cancelled/Uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is a very cool app for positive reinforcement and motivation"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for those who can't self motivate. You pick your pace and move exactly how fast you need to. It helps keep you regular with some routine but is fairly minimal in demands. Just give it a shot and see if helps you too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In my original review I had already purchased the app, but i still couldn't figure out how it worked so i was frustrated. BUT Ive been using Fabulous on and off for almost a year and i swear everytime i use it i feel like a genuinely happier person. Like this app got me to brush my teeth before bed for the first time years and I think that's pretty awesome."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Have only used for 3 days but definitely helps me focus on being more productive and feel.so.much more confident that I'm not forgetting anything especially myself in my own life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the coaching I enjoy the most. The relaxed sounds aren't bad either."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is life changing! It has helped me identify habits that help me progress. The importance of self care and to focus whats makes me happy. I now know the value of self care and will be using this app dor a very very long time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply amazing. You must try it to understand how good and smart it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"One of my biggest pet peeves is an unskippable tutorial. I'm a computer nerd. I know know to click a checkbox. Please dont make me walk through the whole app 1 click at a timeAND make me signup for a subscription before Ive even had a chance to poke around in the app to see if it's even going to be something that I might like in the first place. Not trying to hate on this app exclusively-it seems like most of the major apps have moved to this method-but it's the fastest way to make me uninstall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Like the input"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed and then Uninstalled in less than 5 minutes. There is a charge for this app. The price isn't terrible, but I don't want to pay for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I Love the app because it really helps me keep everything together"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best l can not look for a better app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love love love this app I'm proud of myself and this app helped me to be a better person ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app provides a lot. It gives daily inspirational messages, and nudges me to make and complete a bunch of small positive habits that add up. Today I added 50 squats to my workout, did 7 min of mindfulness, journaled briefly related to a coaching clip, texted 3 colleagues to join me for work accountability later, and I'm about to eat a piece of fruit, all things I likely would not have done today without the app. üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asking name, email one can agree. Asking fingerprint? Who knows what kind of bugs you put now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was unclear on where to start my new journey and habits and this app is helping me tremendously thus far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! A bit much for what I'm looking for but I think everyone needs this app, not to utilize the whole thing but there is something to help everyone in here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Different, empowering, calming"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Charges you pretty quickly, but I definitely recommend. Though I wish it billed monthly, it's definitely working. Not for everyone, but, it's geared towards a broad audience. Definitely for people who struggle with depression slowing them down rather than making them sad. This is 500 times better than Finch."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"For now its been a nice experience. Just 6 days and it has helped me to order little aspects of my life. We'll se later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it has helped me make my morning routine better for myself and helped me eat more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice gamification throughout the app. I'd like to see a widget that compliments the experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Waiting for customer support to get back to me since they decided to charge my account for an annual subscription which 1. I DIDNT CHOOSE ANNUAL I CHOSE MONTHLY and 2. I cancelled before the free trial was up. This is my second time writing this review on here because my other 1 star review ""magically"" disappeared after they responded to it telling me to contact them like I haven't already done that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This was really useful and it reminded me to do all this stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wil make me so organized"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the daily coaching letters!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only been a few days but really enjoying it. I don't feel overwhelmed and the motivational side is great! Feels like a breath of fresh air amongst all the stress if I'm honest!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"As many others have said (which I wish I'd seen before downloading), the free trial is EXTREMELY HARD to cancel. They make it so difficult to do and customer service is non-existent. Also, the ""7 day free trial"" is actually a 6 day free trial, because if you cancel on the 7th day they will still charge you $55. I'd like this app a lot more if they didn't try to steal your money by making it difficult to cancel."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why would I put my credit card information in before I'm able to even try the app to see if I like it. A week free is why I signed up, but it wouldn't let me even use the app unless I put in my payment information. It said you can cancel at anytime, but it's not worth the hassle for something I couldn't even try first. You would definitely get more users if you let them actually try the app before asking for payment information. Just a thought..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app, and signed up for the 7 day trial and I had to put my card info. It said it will give me a reminder once the trial was over, however I did not get a reminder. I thought it would unsubscribe once I deleted the app, however still they charged me a hefty amount of money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's not what I was looking for, and I don't want to pay for a subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So helpful helps me with my goals and creating better habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Cool design and concept. I can't afford 54.99 a year though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have downloaded it ,,but to fill the initials its not working, i mean when i write my email , there is no pop up of any kind ,like okay or next step etc etc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Not a bad app. I enjoy it a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love how interactive this is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's more of practicing Self awareness and improving your weaknesses and finding ways how to live a healthy balance life wholistically. In case we are missing other important things that we should do in our everyday lives."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Hate it! I wanted something to let me make my check list, not answer a million questions!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love fabulous, its catering to how we best change and what we change. Reccommended for anyone who is changing something in their life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes my mental health better. I recommend for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helps me make routines at baby steps speed. Which is just my style. And it doesn't ridicule me if I miss a day ü§ó I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Well put together and lots to do. Enjoying it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ... its helping heaps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome! The more I use it the more I find. It keeps you connected to the moment by showing you how to STAY in the moment. Helps you disconnect for a bit by showing you how to balance time and habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience, you try to unsubscribe uncessefully and then they charge you and are not willing to five a refund for an used unuseful app and you are charged for 12 months ahead. They can at least refund pro rata on the unused months."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic app, it's literally brought me back from rock bottom three times and helped improve my life I'd love to work for them!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scamming why you charged me $39.99 on the fourth day and I signed up for 30 trial to try then you charged me $1.20 international transaction that's crazy if you not going to refund me my money I will dispute those transactions. I don't like the app. Update : to your Update to be honest it's the worst responded to your response also it's the worst customer service it's no way to get in touch with anyone......"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üçà"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is the perfect mix between a habit tracker and motivation app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far enjoying my experience. Only two days in though so I will consciously try to keep this up and build strong good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why can't I enter my email....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very Motivational! I think you have to be in the mindset for change to really get everything out of the program. I love the stories and anecdotes. Its perfectly customized so that you always have control over what you'd like to prioritize in your journey. I subscribed before but was unsuccessful. Today, I wish I took the program more seriously. I'm not perfect but I'm enjoying this imperfect, gentle journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Before i downloaded this app i was so unmotivated now that i downloaded it im so happy and motivated and it honestly helps so much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty darn fabulous. This app has inspired me to build and tighten up my healthy routines"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is Brilliant Fantastic Fabulous, in short it is my BFF now."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helpful app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app! It reminds me to do the kind things I should do to myself every day üíìüíïüíòüíóüíñüåºüé†"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Even though after the free trial, they still charged me. I had a hard time finding how to unsubscribe from the free trial... And $55/month for just reminders... I mean like c'mon. It would be beneficial if it was a lot cheaper to access all the services where you can easily look up some healthy benefits yourself for free on Google.... Do not recommend trying out..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a full year after my 2 week trial with no notification. I did not get an email warning me my trial was expiring, I did not get an email saying I had been charged, I did continue to get emails telling me to sign up for premium with a discount however. Because I didn't notice for over 7 days they refused to give me a refund. Scummy behavior."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app with engaging exercises and great motivational props!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's expensive and isn't what I was looking for."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helpful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is decent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this for a few days but so far so good...it's fun and I think this will definitely keep me accountable in many aspects of life!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the non-judgmental approach, & daily encouragement. I also love the voices of the narrators."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"you cannot cancel the subscription, always the page doesn't work, it's a robbery, they keep trying take 40 dollars of my account, and when i try to cancel the app crash"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very complicated to pay when you don't have a visa debit card and the paypal need visa debit card for registration too"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app helped me be better in just 2 days"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The ideal app for certain people who struggle with motivation and really benefit from a companion app. For me, it's just too cheesy. The tone is laid on thick and very early when you use the app (messages from your ""future self"" etc.) The app's title says it all. For people seeking something a little more low-key, this isn't it. Personally I feel like they aim for life-changing positivity right away, and that isn't very realistic for many. Good for some people though, no doubt. 2.5 stars"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. The practicality to using this app is that you have to have so much more screen time. Not to mention the rigorous attempts to cancel the subscription if you aren't mindful to fully create an account before filling out their questions and accepting the 7 days free. Oddly difficult web page setup too, considering you can't do the cancelation by phone or by app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app and the concept, but $40 at once might be a stretch. I haven't decided yet!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been exactly what I was looking for. It's easy to follow. And has great tips to help me make myself a better person. Looking forward to setting more goals. Keeps me on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I thought this was pretty cool at first , until I got billed 55$ after they extended my premium trial to 30 days. Not cool.. then to manage your account, when you hit the link it says "" please login on the website"" ? ...c'mon fabulous if you want to increase customer retention you should NOT be trying to trick people... that's why I am canceling! Very grimey move üëéüèæ..and now that I have gone to the website and I hit login.guess what..it's a blank screen .ALSO please stop changing my card!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Seriously high quality surprised with how genuinly life usfull it is"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It had helped me. But my journey keeps getting stuck. There was only a story once. I am getting bored of the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App took forever to get to the routines + no option to skip ahead. Frustrating when I want to work on productivy and my time is being wasted. Then it says it takes 15 days to form a habit but the trial is only 7 days. No option to pay monthly (less risky) only annually. Then, it went ahead and chose my first goal for me: drink water every Morning which I already do! I have a solid morning routine but tend to get lost as the day goes on. Disappointed with lack of customization."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The morning prompt is pinging me through my do not disturb even though my built-in Android do not disturb feature is set to not allow any apps to do so. I can't figure out how this app is getting through my do not disturb, but it keeps pinging me when I'm still asleep and that's not okay."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not trust this app, they try true to lure you into getting the 7 day trial and once you do they make it the absolut hardest to cancel your subscription not to mention the fact that they still have my billing info since you cant delete it, the creators of this app should be ashamed of themselves for making such a scummy cashgrab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Full of surprises"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Grately built app and very fine info. There are some unhealty recomandations, like breskfast is nessesary and most impordant meal. But i like it alot overall 4/5"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I thought this app was a joke but then I have it a try and day after day it's really help me stay on track. I like that I can get motivation from others as well. Worth every penny."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really good application very well done and intuitive to use. It is apt that other functions are to pay for but also the free version is still very enjoyable!! Recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far, but the poems are a bit naff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Could be a little less cluttered. Overall I love it!!! So many cool and helpful features"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Sufficient and clear activities. Great functionally and wonderfully designed tips and processes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm assuming at the start of the app it's asking me questions to get to know me but I can't see any of them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awesome app for holistic wellbeing....a great investment in oneself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this apps, my life has been good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"In general the app is good, annoying that they keep saying ""drink water"" in the morning when it's not an issue for me. The 7 day trial is the issue, I had no warning of it ending and ended up with a $69.95 invoice on my account. I'm not even sure where the extra $30 came from because they advertise premium as $39.95. I haven't used the app or the premium but it still shows me as a premium member despite the fact I will not be paying for it - and have cancelled the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why people have to pay for apps like this?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app so far day 4"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app that eases you in to good habits and teaches you how to celebrate small victories"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm extremely happy with this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I like the app. I am trying to improve myself, get into a routine that will help me long term with my health and mental well-being. I like their approach and I don't feel judged. I really appreciate their scientific approach with very small and incremental steps. I'd love to review my goals to see what I've achieved so far, but unfortunately I haven't unlocked enough goals yet to unlock this feature. Other than that, I really like the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Everyone, The app helps you live a better life. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Love that it has a gaming type of effect, as in you have to achieve different levels. Makes you want to use the app and build new habits at the same time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the slow start prompt - I have to remember to not overwhelm myself by so many new routines at once and this helps. I enjoy the prompts - the stories and the goals. Great voice over choices! And the coaching messages are short and impactful. I am enjoying myself this time around. (Tried before - but tried to many new routines at once - this feels better)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great and inspiring"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It really feels like the app needs a UX overhaul. My partner gave it up pretty quick due to lack of clarity, and the fact that you offer people coaching sessions then suddenly cut them off if they aren't premium yet. I am still using the app (and enjoying it... Premium even), but I can't recommend to others unless unless it gets streamlined."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app it has helped me a lot I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Everytime you try to add a new habit it will just take you to the subscription page. So the free version basically means you can't set tasks to do, which is the whole purpose of the app, making the entire free version of the app absolutely useless. I'm out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Keep it free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps me start and maintain healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's good so far very interesting idea and it is keeping me motivated:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Took money despite trial being cancelled! Subscription says expired March, annual premium taken from bank April. Impossible to contact them to resolve. You cannot go through Google Play as money taken direct by Fabulous. Email the link - tells you to use the app. Use app form - you have to submit a screenshot of your charge/receipt but the upload link does not do anything so you cannot submit. Very annoying and ¬£34.99 down!! Be careful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I rated you 3 for I'm still trying to critically follow. The app is quite a great one and I believe I will learn more for my personal change goal."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic uplifting life coaching app for your daily life. So colorful and full of inspiration on a step by step journey. This app offers a subscription after the trail period"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! I downloaded yesterday and already I'm drinking far more water than I ever have, and I'm finally using my yoga mat again! This app is really fantastic for any personal goals or aspirations you may have."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly so far so good ‚ô° really easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the excellent apps I have ever seen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Best app ever!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Really helps you build a good life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Classic scam. Trap for people w low IQ who will think 'omg my life has changed' just looking at the texts makes you cringe and some dude literally sit and wrote those I was hoping to listen some chill musics after downloading it after seeing an ad but it was completly diffrent even than I gave the app a chance and trying out but it was a load of BS actually.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is amazing! I'm proud of this app. They let us explore our routine with so many options, through mindful routine to physical activities. Fun and very helpful. With this app, I more stick to the plan, since I'm pretty forgetful. Thank you Fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love it!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I genuinely feel like this app has helped me, but it needs an option to download images. Thankfully I can read them in the app, but I've seen several comments from people who can't. Right now you can't save anything without taking a screenshot."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"For the most part I really liked this app. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF LIVE LAUGH LOVE PLEASE FIX THE SCREEN FREEZING BUG. Every*time* an alarm goes off (which is WHY I liked the app), the entire bottom half of my phone doesn't respond. I have to either try to force quit the app (if it lets me) or restart my phone. On top of that the sounds will also continue playing even when I turn off full screen reminders. Again defeating the purpose of PAYING for this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is a nice easy to follow app for setting daily goals for yourself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Hey I need help I can not log into the app it reach where it ask for my email but does bring continue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app has so much potential (some slight user interface issues make it not perfect yet). It helps create habits and routines in a very human way and seems very effective and comfy. I give it 3 stars only because it has one major flaw. Mental health is obviously impacted by exercise and nutrition, but fabulous then thinks its ok to push diets on you with no TW or way to hide it. In the first journey you automatically get put on it asks you to get rid of all your cookies and u cant skip it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! It has been such a big help to me! My only complaint is I really wish there was a widget available for the app! It would be much more beneficial if I could It right on my home screen!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app is really productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had stopped using this app sometime last year. I was surprised to see that two days ago, I was charged for another year's subscription, with no warning or anything. I haven't had the app on my phone in over 6 months and was pretty upset to be charged without so much as an email saying that the year's subscription I paid for last year was running out and would automatically renew."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app/company is a scam. I had signed up for what was marketed to me as a lifetime membership, but then was billed separately for an annual membership."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app - it help me help myself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good! The missing star is because they push premium in some sketchy ways sometimes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app because it helps a lot and I think if you need a day afternoon and night routine then I think you should use this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very fun and easy to operate and understand with a lot of different options I love the 7 min exercise especially."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's just about a Week I use this App. The app is amazing and it makes you feel calm when you are anxious or depressed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can some one please tell me how I unsubscribe?? DO NOT download this app. I didn't even sign up to paying it just popped up with a page, froze and then said I am paying ¬£35 pound a year for it?!?! There is no support. When you go on ""contact us"" it is a few options to select from with an automated reply!!!!! Help help please if any one knows how to cancel this subscription I never signed up for ... Whilst it's a free trial."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the story and it helps me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love it. I think it will help me a lot to be motivated and productive everyday. The apps gives me tips that will surely make my everyday life happy. But i unistall it immediately for i need to buy premium just to be happy, motivated and productive? I tought it will help me organize my daily routines, but the only thing this app ever told me if i didnt buy premium is to drink a water every time a wake upü§®..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Its an amazing app just as its name fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far i love it. third day and i established the habit of drinking water right after waking up. i always struggled with self-care. but this app - perfect."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I think over all experience is really good. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is bcoz I'm from India and it's premium version is a bit spending for a jobless student like me. So that's all!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just went through a breakup. This app has truly been helping me to heal and I do not feel alone in this process."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I like this app, the concept is simple, the UI/UX is good and sleek. But my reason for this 1-star-review is sadly to warn about the annual subscription that is immideately forced onto you after the trial. 40‚Ç¨ is a really steep price and I cannot afford it. I contacted the support and hope they can help me. I guess I wasn't the target audience. Fulfilling my habits seems insignificant if i cannot even afford food and medicine. For this reason i can't recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Read it. Listen to it. Really think about what it is getting at. Do it. It will help."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful with completing basic everyday tasks that I have a hard time being motivated to do on my own. It also gives me great advise and makes me feel good about even the little things I accomplish like drinking water or taking time to breathe! Love this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I, in fact, am at a crossroad in my life that my crystal ball did not prep me for. I'm glad to be here. In Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Only reason not 5 is because the advertising on app store has pictures of different stuff then it actually is but still a great game‚ù§ L"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The instructions they give to unsubscribe the trial before being charged do not work. FYI YOU MUST CANCEL 24HRS BEFORE THE FREE TRIAL ENDS NOT TO BE CHARGED. If you signed up through the play store and the subscription isn't showing up you need to go to the fabulous website. Use your email to do ""forgot password"" to create new password and sign in that way. Then you can cancel the subscription in the website even if you signed up via play store or iTunes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the ease of navigation. Hate it's a membership program. Would have stuck with it, if it wasn't."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't like the app so I attempted to cancel my free trial (and they made sure to make that process a little harder by directing me to a web browser) yet they still charged me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't get past the email screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a free trial and am not able to find any way to contact someone. I was charged for an annual plan which was 40 usd and I find it incredibly rude."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app for motivating you and for your day to day achievements.... ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving ittt"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Got the 7 day trail, set it up to be removed, it did not seem worth the money to me, was still charged the yearly subscription I've tried communicating with them its been a week still no response."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"You can't try it without putting in credit card number and now it doesn't show up in my Google subscriptions to cancel! App is fine. Seems like it would be useful for someone who really needs a kick start but first goals are ""drink water"" - ok but seems like it's babying you a bit..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app. I feel better already. üôèüèΩüåü‚ú®‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"In my journey to get more discipline with my life while battling years of bad mental health, Fabulous is the lifesaver jacket that I need when drowning. The app improvements are getting Fabulous to another great level."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing,it's a lovley app for people with anxiety!!‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liking it so far! While the app can be a little overwhelming, if you're a person who responds well to lists, this will help you straighten out your habits and achieve your goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to have small, steady and consistent reminders at the right times in my day. Insightful coaching tailored to my individual personality, goals and needs."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's making a difference. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I am only a couple of days in, so this review is based on my initial thoughts of Fabulous. The whole thing seems to be very well thought out and I like the slow pace, I don't feel overwhelmed with the morning routine, and I like that there are options to fit different routines. I will revisit this review once I have used the app for a while."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"the concept of incremental change is very useful!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's extremely easy to incorporate small steps to create better achievable habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cool app, great concept that's executed well"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this appüòÅüôÇüíì‚öò‚ÄºÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use (if you like paying attention) and its art style is nice and I LOVE CHECKLISTS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This application has been soo helpful ,looking forward to a great successful journey ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good app overall, however when I woke up this morning I couldn't stop the alarm, so I had to delete it, however then the alarm still continued... So in order to stop the alarm I had to restart my phone aswell"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"3 days in and I am enjoying the reminders. I am shocked at how easy it has been and how much I want to check off all the tasks on each routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Too many notifications. I tried to turn them off and they kept coming, so I uninstalled."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I can't leave my review from the other device..i don't know why. I'll run out of words thanking the developers. Thank you for making this awesome app. Would seem like a exaggeration but it really brought me back to life..made me see things clearer.. brought me back to the awesome mindset I had somehow left behind. The premium is just....worth it. THANK YOU."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Makes me feel productive and happy with myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps self discipline."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"There is one thing that I absolutely hate about using this app, and that is it constantly pesters me to share with friends. I wish there was an option to say ""never ask me to share again"" or ""I never want to share"" Seriously I've been thinking of deleting this app several times just because it's so annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is really good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! It is really easy to use and it really motivates you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Even if you pause the activity, you can't leave the page without having to start the activity over."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So many times while using this app I have thought to myself ""These guys deserve a Nobel Peace Prize"" I honestly think it's great to build habits, really builds things up from the ground up, telling you what you're acheving and why you're currently doing something. In a word, Amazing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Its fake and time wasting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful illustrations that give us peace and joy. Great format, design and experience. Could be possible to turn the screen off while we are reading with the song goin on and the time running; n even change the time for each suggested habit. Congrats for the team and creators!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great for my busy Entrepreneur-Mom life! Dealing with chronic illness, too, means I need to be careful with how I use my limited energy. Three days into my Fabulous Journey, I'm getting the hang of the app and seeing a decrease in my anxiety levels. Fabulous reminds me to take care of my first responsibility: me. Everything else fills in nicely so far! I did turn off the reminder bubbles because my phone touch screen wouldn't work properly with them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Works better than I expected, recommended for those who need it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"PSA!!!! DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! IT WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND WONT ALL YOU TO CANCEL. I HAVE SPENT THE LAST 4 DAYS TURNING TO CANCEL MY TRAIL AND TODAY THEY BILLED MY CARD 39.99 IM COMPLETELY PISSED OFF. THIS IS WHY I NEVER PUT MY BANK TO ANY OF THIS PHONE APPS. IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD. YOU CANT EVEN GET ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE BUT THEY CAN TAKE YOU MONEY!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I don't use the premium but this app is very positive and straightforward in helping you create habits that work best for you. It does not force you to do anything and it always asks if you're up for a new challenge. I like the calm vibes it sets forth into me whenever I open it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"FANTASTIC! Gentle, easy, rewarding, if this was a personality it would be extremely likeable!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The fabulous app definitely has potential to do great things but why do we have access to the daily coaching if you have to pay to actually get coaching. I put it on my daily routine list but have recently taken it off because if you don't have premium there almost no point for using the coaching option. as it starts to read you maybe get 1 minute through and it cuts off mid sentence would be nice if there was some form of free coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont install this app it will just steal all your personal information whit shady questions even your fingerprint! Wich is a red flag be warned."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing way of building your own routine crafted perfectly to your needs. I'd probably have a bit more content for shift workers as readjusting the routine on the app to fit nights shifts /last shifts can be a bit frustrating but overall amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App is not working"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"steer clear from these scammers!!!! I used ""fabulous"" and I was using the free trial and there was a very misleading ad that told me that I can pay only 0.99$ for one month so I bought it and what I didn't know is that I will be obligated to pay 40$ for a full year subscription (it wasn't written anywhere, only on Tiny letters that you couldn't notice) I had not had an intention to buy a full year subscription and the ad was very confusing, I tried to connect them but to no avail, you can't contact them anywhere if you try to go to their website (but only on the phone version because only there you can go to ""contact us"" page if you try on the computer it doesn't exist all you can do there and only there is cancel your subscription and that is absurd) and not only that when you finally reach that ""contact us"" page you only get a silly robot that doesn't help you at all I had to reach google play support so they can tell me how to contact those scammers. and even more not only did I see I got charged this month for 40$ I saw will be charged for another 40$ in the next month I don't want this!!! they simply stole my money!! and they keep charging me and I cant contact them! stay clear from this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is an amazing app and help you in making your own routine on daily basis"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Doesn't get past the email sign up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They use predatory marketing tricks to make you subscribe the app and then make it really difficult to unsubscribe."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Can't really do the whole long term self improvement if I'm stressed about getting my money worth after a week"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the project"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Really helped me start with little changes that grew to become big changes"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like this app is not a one size fits all type. It's very personalized.... it starts with very baby steps and builds on those. Such as drink water in the morning for 3 days.... stretch for 1 min... love this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the soothing motivation. I'm not feeling obligated while also feeling that something is holding me accountable. It does have access to share with family and friends...I have not moved into that direction but I've been utilizing a lot of the tools available."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"its fabulous!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's working. I've been playing guitar and reading for some data in a row"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the morning routine and how I was able to set the notification for it to go off on my walk to work so I can answer the questions at the perfect time everymorning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I couldn't press continue when i already enter my email why"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I got the refund back after one day thank you for good customer service.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not impressed. This may be better suited for people who seriously lack disciple and direction. You also can't get far without paying for a subscription. I deleted the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Sometimes it's a little confusing but once you get the hang of it . .. it's really does help you create new & healthier habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really like the app I just don't like that too much details inside but so far it's awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It doesn't say anything about payment until you've already went through everything you want from the app. You have to pay. I'm unable to try it because of that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is just a treasure that I founded"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hopeful that this will help me make the necessary changes . I like the app sounds and colours."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Finding the interface unintuitive, kept prompting to leave a review so here it is."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app essentially has one message: ""Be a morning person"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I had cancel the subscription why did you guys still take my money???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app for building small good habits. Premium is very expensive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Excellent app, I am picking up my healthy habits. It took little time to understand the app, it adds up activities over time, as and when I finish precious ones. I am super happy to use this. Currently on free membership. But I will upgrade soon."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app could actually change my life, but a lot of people can't afford $50 right now. It's also confusing when you send several emails with one saying 7 day free trial and then another saying 30 day free pass with no way to apply it to your existing account. You can not cancel in the app you have to log in to the website. It's hard to find the website login. I'm disappointed. It's just another tool that is out of reach for the lower class."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As i learn more about my adhd and allow this app to help me navigate time, I am more and more grateful to have this tool."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Terrible onboarding experience. Start signup, have tons to read, some videos to play, wasn't really prepared to spend 5+ minutes going through everything. On top of that they say you'll start seeing changes in 14 days, but only offer a 7 day trial on the app. I'd tried to sign up on the website which I think was giving me a 30 day trial but also asking me to pay for that, and the cost was more than the monthly cost for the app? Deeply confusing and will probably lead me to dropping it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app with good intentions, however I did not end up wanting the premium membership. But it billed me at 2 in the morning without my knowledge and now I'm stuck with a membership I do not want and can't even use. It says the payment was declined, which I sincerely hope it was. I tried going through customer support but the entire process is not user friendly and heavily automated. Skip this app there's better ones to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A nice, gentle, helpful productivity app. I hope to use it more as time goes on, and possibly even pay for premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too much babble"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying so far. Really interactive and engaging with the colors and coaching. Hoping to finally be able to set habits and routines with this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It'll get better I promise, just stick with it, follow through and improve your life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its helping me with ALOT"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had this app for less than 24 hours and it demanded far too much attention with notifications & emails. I don't think my path to wellness includes having to look at my phone more. That's all fine. People are different and maybe this works for some people. Just not me. The real problem is they wouldn't let me cancel my plan trough the app. I had to go to their website - which the app didn't even link to. This is a transparent attempt to keep people from canceling and I find it gross as hell."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy simple steps that build a routine and simple goals helps me to feel more accomplished."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice and enjoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's a ripoff, It tries to force you habits that you don't want and when you ask for refund they will just ignore your request for refund..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like A loyal close friend follow up with you your daily life .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love the app but I hope there would be a free version though"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This might actually help to keep me motivated about my self care. Paid for a year to see how it goes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far love this app is definitely helping me get out of my looping depression. Helping me create new habits and break old ones. I'll make a new comment after using it for a month."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still working through this app but so far I am loving it. I'm sticking to things, I feel healthier and happier. I definitely feel more focused and alot less procrastinating going on! Happy so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The free trial is NOT free, it immediately charged my credit card & I have been unable to unsubscribe. I have reached out to their technical support for help but have received no answer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My fav app besides SoundCloud lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very helpful üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app... Its challenging but keeps me in track everyday."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice for mindfulness, education, and to help with little reminders that keeps the soul happy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried the free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Day 3 and I adore this app. The animations, the story and how it's keeping me on track. So full of love for fabulous ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I never activated my subscription but was still charged anyways. No refunds, they say. They removed my last review, so I'm posting this again. DONT TRUST THIS APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Fabulously a waste of time and money. Did the free trail bc why not, ended up never using it and when I go to cancel, it's not available thru the app, you have to open up a web browser and sign in to cancel, wouldn't let me cancel so the free trail period passes so I get a $40 charge. Try and go through the refund on the support and the refund application doesn't let me complete it so I can't ask for a refund. Contact CS and all they say is sorry can't help you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really easy to use! I love how it engages you to do better!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't had the app for long but I love it already. I really like the daily letters and the different steps to create habits. It provides a gentle push that doesn't leave me feeling like a failure if not accomplished for the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had cancelled my subscription days before the due date, and yet, the money got debited. Please issue a refund at the earliest."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app to get better on healthy habits. The app is always improving and adding New challenge very Nice !"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Visually pleasing and comforting. A great way to keep track of healthy habits and commit to them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Instead of holding your hand, this app shoves you in a baby stroller and pushes you toward where they think you need to go (based on your beginning survey.) If there's a way to design my own good habit challenges, it's hidden in the overly-complex user interface."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it, super helpful with my A.D.D issues and pulling out of depression"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Sensational"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app if you want to gave a great routine, i love this app its exactly what i was looking for ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just get it It's free so why not just change your life for the good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's not perfect, but I think it's doing the job. Enjoying working through this so far. I'm a mum to 2 little boys under 3, focusing on little easy habits is realistic and helping me to look after me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really a good app. I can see the change it is doing in me. So you should try it out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would love to try this app but I'm not comfortable using my finger print to ""sign the contract"". Why is this necessary?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is more of a question but do you need to pay for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far they have been very helpful to me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I am super excited about this app and I am so glad I decided to try it. It is giving me very positive, beautiful every!! Personally, I am going thru a tough tome mentally, and the kind things this app says, and by keeping my mind focused on positivity, I'm hoping I can retrain my brain. If anything changes and later on I don't think it deserves a 5 star, then I will adjust my Rating, but i doubt that will happen. Thank you üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it keeps me on track..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's has helped me keep myself on track and motivate me to do it everyday üôÇ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cant give a 5star yet since its only been 3 days of use . But its been good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a very nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. It is creative and inspiring.b Small steps at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Did not feel alright with it forcing me to sign with my email BEFORE telling that the app costs money. (you geet a free week)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I feel I was charged unrightfully ,but I can say all things work together for the good. Romans 8:28 This app has been a big help. üôèüèæ But there are still some kinks with my subscription situation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Seems like a great program and could really help over time, but not everyone can come up w that much $ at one time. üòï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Leveling up irl"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy that the app keeps me focused on my goals, and keeping my streak alive on the journey is psychologically rewarding. However, if you get overwhelmed with cluttered interfaces I would strongly recommend avoiding this application. I only use it for actual goal tracking; there is so much noise on the pages that I don't know where to click aside from goals."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"FABULOUS üëåüèæ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Glitchy app. Customer service won't refund me my 39.99. After signing up for a trial, I never saw premium benefits. This made me believe the transaction didn't actually go through until I was charged later. Customer service said it was because I never created a user profile. How could I have if that wasn't an option presented to me in the app? If you do not see premium benefits in the trial, immediately seek refund or else the process will be hellish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm early in the program but so far I'm committed to stay the course. Looking forward to finding new guidance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Makes starting and keeping good habits easy and enjoyable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Making small and consistent steps for a better tomorrow!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. Very helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Umm hey I accidentally purchase the premium...can i unpurchased it..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous helps you stay motivated, there is a calmness in each step, nothing feels forced."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is terrible. How can an app be so annoyingly pushy and have zero flexibility. I feel like I'm treated as a toddler."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The positive messages, the graphics, everything makes it be fabulous üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I loved this app. It really helps me in establishing a new routine with many benefits. Only problem I faced is I am not able to sign in to google account for joining in live challenges. It shows some error hope u rectify it. Otherwise it's an amazing app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. It's a little difficult to navigate, but there's really no way to get it wrong. Visually gorgeous, but some of the voices grate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I looks sweet and full of energy and there is like lot of motivation to do those thinks (like a story)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wish there was more free content"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me remember to do the things I need to do! I haven't forgotten about the app or just got bored of it like other apps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They charge me 35 dollars and and I don't know why also I never use this application , and they don't want return my money , I don't recommend this application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Had a special going a few years back but then changed the terms and charged me higher than the full price listed for a full year when they were only supposed to charge me a discounted rate for 1 month, and not until the end of the free sample. They charged me right away. I tried many times to contact them but they refused to respond and kept my money. Leaving new review bc I just ran across this in app suggestions and got pissed all over again! I'm still mad! üò°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It's a great idea, but I hate it when apps claim that it's a free trial but obligate you to put your credit card info in. Didn't even bother anymore when I saw that. No shame in wanting to sell a product, but it is to toy with people's well being."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fascinated so far and seeing a difference!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like it so far and will update my review after I have more time with it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Almost 60 freaking dollars!!!??? You have got to be kidding me. Even with a free week trial, that's outrageous. And having to sign up for automatic billing before the free trial, CLOWN APP."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me on track with my health and motivation of cleaning, and every day life. I'm so grateful!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just fabulous ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do NOT trust. I upgraded to prem while I trialed. I didnt like app. Caused my phone to glitch AND just too many alarms. I used it 3 days max then canceled within the trial period. I recv a conf email about canceling, which was not a user friendly process. Days later, I was charged the full $39.99. I immediately reached out for help. Have sent 3 emails. Nothing. Not one reply. I'm disputing the charge with the bank. I have all the documentation to show it was an inappropriate charge. Crooks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good it's like a very positive good friend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the interactive fotmat"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want to build healthy habits, you are in the right place"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing animation and stories"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Asks for an email up-front, states will provide 7 days to try, yet user has to provide a payment method... No thanks. If it's free to try for 7 days, then why force users to provide payment info before they can even try the app... Geez."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"fixed my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing, i wish that there were more taks to be able to do for non premium memebers though. Otherwise this app has helped me be calm and jot be negative. My days have been so much better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a fantastic application to help you make improvements in your life one good habit at a time. Highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fun journey to help set your mind on a path of success!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best tool you didnt know you needed! Life coach in an app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is seriously amazing to me, never thought an app would seriously help so much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love the app no cash for the 300 lifetime a bit crazy for something that isn't going to last a lifetime"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I just subscribed on Friday. I do like the whole approach this app is taking. I do however feel that it could be designed in a way that could make it easier to both figure out exactly what is offered and what is what. It's a bit overwhelming ...to me anywayü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Overall, it's great with some small negatives. Like I said it is a bit complicated to figure out but if or when you do... You will be happy you purchased this app IMO"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Every time this app pops up it freezes my bottom half of my phone screen up. It's so annoying please fix it. Now that I found a way to stop this app from taking over my screen I get sound that I cannot stop. I just had to remove it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not do the free trial because it will charge you the premium price anyway! Google Play is usually pretty good about refunds within 24 hours, which I tried to do, but my transaction history for this app isn't there. Instead, it charged me through their website that I never used and THEY have a strict no return policy. Also good luck trying to get ahold of them. Either their links don't work or they send you in circles."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it's friendly easy to use and so much more I love this app and I'm still slowly growing progress This app is totally Recommendebl üëçüèªüëåüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's really the most helpful and safe app when it comes to mental health !! i enjoy using this app . it's really helps me a lot ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it so far but I'm new to it so still navigating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I actually like this app fairly well - it is charming and pretty easy to navigate, and the affirmations you receive for completing tasks are nice. I appreciate the pace at which the app acclimates you to new habits. However, when I attempted to cancel my subscription on the 7th day of my free trial, I was still charged the $40 annual fee. I am not certain why my cancellation was not successful. I will not be recommending Fabulous for this reason."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"New here but absolutely love the app From content to UI design, it has won my heart from all aspects. Keep growing. I hope more people use this app and improve their lives"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying this app overall. I'm currently working on my morning routine and this all has made it easier to organize my actions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed. It takes a little of practice to understand how it works, but then its really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It really made me do the whole survey just to tell me I had to pay? I have seen the ads for this and none of them say anything about paying! It's so stupid that should have to pay for my mental health! So selfish. I can't afford this. It's so sad that I have to pay to get out of bed in the morning. I'm done"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"That's useless! It gives you some naggy reminders and ""inspirational"" stories. They lure you with a cheap trial that you pay for, and then BAM! It auto renewed with a 40$ charge, no refunds, no customer service and no way to contact anybody. Don't be tempted, don't even try this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App not working. It stuck on the same screen"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really amazing üòç I am very üòä happy with fabulous app‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It will make you answer all these questions for the 'right coaching' and only then tell you it's premium membership. Literally everything (except for daily reminder about drinking water) has to be paid for"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The fact that you have to pay for self change is terrible"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is helping me get healthy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greet app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This is geared almost exclusively towards women, or men who are not dissimilar from women. Unrelated to that, I found the pace to be way too slow and the goals to be too unambitious to inspire action. The slow pace of progress seems to push you into a paid relationship for which there is not the prospect of much value. For someone who needs to be told they're special and not for someone looking for accountability."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They make it confusing and difficult to cancel. Very bad for business. Plus they charged twice on my card and blamed me for it. If you read through their responses to this same kind of confusing and difficulty with canceling, they seem to state exact same thing. They are scamming. The app doesn't appear in my Google subscriptions either. They won't refund anyone either. Deserves negative stars!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's the best thing ever helps you in so many ways you should really try it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the poems, meditations, and the daily challenges helps me start my day; and I have more energy these days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is sooo good it help me in 3 days I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving the motivation it gives, also love that it starts small and manageable and progresses over time but you also have the option to add more if you want to hit the ground running"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app üòçüòç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"First message I get is a push a push notification after I'm asleep late at night. Seriously? Seems more energy is input on making it pretty than functionality. Want to cancel? Good luck finding it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only had this app for a week, it has been nice having something to remind me to do the small things and congratulates me for doing them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Loving it. Beautiful, meaningful, soothing. Be prepared to set aside time and space each day to work with it. The Premium vers. daily coachings are my favorite part. Only two issues why I gave 4 not 5 stars. Getting started isn't as intuitive as I would like bc supplemental features are not explained and some elements are locked behind time or achievement gates. 2nd, once you close the Daily Coachings they are never again available to view or hear, very disappointing bc they are the best part."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you have come to a cross road in life, unsure of how to go forward or what your priorities are this fabulous app is for you. If you are like me who has gotten in the habit of putting other's needs above your own to the point that your questioning your worth this spp is definitely for you. There is no judging and you can work on areas as it is customized and you decide where you need to focus. It is inspirational, enjoy the app üòä."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have ADHD and building good habits is very difficult because of it. This app has seriously been getting me to better myself in ways I never would have thought, and it also gives me motivation when I need it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great when you need some guidance. It will give you advice and insights that show what stops us and what keeps us going. My anxiety has decreased and I now have a morning routine that works for my hectic schedule. It's an app that will retrain your mind to take control of your day on step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really Good App. Motivational. You must want the change."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful app and it really works for all ages üòÄ it is starting to freeze on my phone though. Maybe cause of my phones age but it's a beautiful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so decent. I need to know how turn the sound off, haven't looked that far into the app. All in all, it's spot on with learning your appropriate times for your tasks...which I like; The AI intuitive-ness about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app very motivational and really interesting üëèüëèüëè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is just what you need, even if it's stopping bad addictions, gross habits, etc. Huge shoutout to the creators. üíö"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I downloaded the app yesterday evening filled out everything that needed to be filled out and started my journey which begun with drinking water first thing in the morning I did that then as I clicked on find a daily routine it's just a white screen and I can interact with anything I've already downloaded and deleted the app again but it's quite frustrating as I was excited to use the app. That's my ramble hope the devs can fix(the app seems amazing aside from this set back) thanks devs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Interesting"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me so much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very nice! If you are trying to create a perfect morning routine for yourself then this is the app to go for! You mostly don't need the premium but incase you want more exercise options or any topic, it is better if you take the premium option. I am so far enjoying this app! Also the Fabulous community has such lovely people who motivate each other so, this app is an all rounder for me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Wasn't impressed, setup process to me wasn't that good. Then I get they don't want you to cancel, but the process was awful to cancel a subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best App I've found"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice design, fun to do. Displays full name in forums, though, and won't let me post anything containing religious terms (non-Buddhist ones anyway.)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect üëçü•∞ is a really good app I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A really great app but only I wanted to put more things to do In routines but you (me)(we) are only able to put four things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It was really cool and I love the concept, love it (>‚ñΩ<)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is vital for me to maintain a structured routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Useless for organizing my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has a ton of resources but it would be awesome if you could change what routines you do on certain days. I don't like that on weekends I can't change to something more simple."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Bidding done great habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very much like the colors and UI of this app. I'm a very colorful person and so minimalist tracker apps don't do it for me. I have ADHD as well, so the stories and interactive elements keep me engaged."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just in my free part at the beginning. Enjoying it so far. Update... Of course you have to actually use it! Back again and like how they give you ideas, but also allow you to tweak and choose."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only a week in, but finding this a great help already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly uplifting, motivating and positive. It's like a friend. It helps against loneliness."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love how each challenge is supported by facts. I was somewhat familiar with the science behind habit building, but this app is great at delivering valuable information at the right time. Will subscribe for my first year. Keep up the good work!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love ittttüå∏üå∏"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The idea of splitting habits into small, manageable steps and then progressing to harder levels gradually is awesome & works perfectly fine. The checklist provided by Fabulous to keep track of my progress is awesome and very useful. The storyboard with motivations & suggestions are inspiring & helping me with the progress. I already feel confident, energetic & healthy just by developing the first few habits of my first journey. Having a companion during my journeys is very encouraging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesomeness! I'm back in fabulous again. I should've never stop the first time to sacrifice doing me for other important family matters. I decided to look for Fabulous again, installed it and placing me first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"stay away - fraudulent charges I liked the app until"" I signed up for this app on the app store over 2 years ago, but it didn't let me cancel it through Google Play and it charged me for 2 years without my permission. It took me ages to finally figure out how to cancel and they won't refund me. I've never used their app but they don't care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app, it really motivates me to do the daily habits! I love the narrator's voice and look forward each new coaching lesson"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's really motivating this app it's good ü§çü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great App! BUT!!! I couldn't use it because of the words used at the contract part about life and death. Also On the first part of the App, the very last question says, How long you should take after you've failed. That's very discouraging, instead of focusing on being a better person, someone would build a mindset that whatever it is that someone is doing he/she will fail, Yes, they will try again but that's after failing. Not very Fabulous words!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Took my money after I cancelled subscription. Not happy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I couldn't fill my email. The app get stuck"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been very interactive and judgement free for me thus far which I appreciate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Overall this app has been amazing, it's has made me rethink my whole day and do things I'd never do without the prompts they suggest. It's helped me establish healthier relationships with a lot of things. It's been a great experience so far a week in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed and uninstalled almost immediately. This is nonsense. ""What major change would benefit you?"" and then promptly fails to deliver changes I care about. ""What do you do when procrastinating?"" And then fails to offer a suggestion of ""music / art / reading"" or anything productive. This is weak social generlization and poor behavioural science. REAL behavioural science is an individually structured approach. If you want to regiment your life better use a to-do list Iin OneNote. It's free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the fact it gives small goals so you don't really think about it I find that's my problem I overthink and set unrealistic goals this app Def helps with that"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've seen so much improvement! I just LOVE how this app can keep you motivated, and relaxed! However, there are some things that cost money like, getting supporting letters, journaling, and some other things..But overall, I love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far, I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app makes creating healthy habits easy and holds you accountable in a loving encouraging way. I'm only a week in but so far I really like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is really a fabulous appü•∫‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is great and even though it gives you lots of reminders it's also on your terms. I have an insane scheduled that changes a lot and I still find it easy to stick to my routines. The nightly coaching is very helpful and also very relaxing. I highly recommend this app to anyone who either has trouble sticking to routines without guidence or is trying to manage ADHD. It also helps with behavior changes and keeping things in a positive light. It's helping me a lot and I hope it helps you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It was all good at first but I got stuck in middle like they were asking my Gmail and after that I couldn't continue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far this app is amazing Update: I still love this app, I've lost some pounds, I drink more water and I love the coaching! Very motivated."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool to help you develop healthier routines that will motivate you too..in love with this app and myself.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free, not worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING APP! Sooooo beautiful and well designed. Stunning."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's like a scam I started the free trial of 7 days and the same day I decided to cancel it because it was not what I was looking for and I recieved the email that my trial was cancelled and what a surprise when 1 week after they take $62 from my account, it's malicious and I feel they are thieves"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Worked well for me, helped me to create new, healthy habits as it says."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If your just curious don't get sucked into being lumped with a subscription cost. I've had to shell out $130 in 12 months. Errrr. Easy money for the app üòè"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Try it. Seriously, just try it. You'll be glad you did."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Second time trying the app. Definitely feeling a stronger desire to engage intentionally, this time. I'm happy I decided to give it another go! I'm quite enjoying the experience and I find myself more eager to check off those tasks in the morning. The coaching and motivational snippets are short, yet entirely motivating. This year has been off to a good start, and I'm hoping to maintain that inertia with a little help from Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Positive and motivating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So, I love this app for guiding me through my routines. However, as someone who has been using this app since 2015 or 2016, I am very unhappy that, rather than charging users to access the newer content as a way of making money, they took away from the basic functionality of the original free app, forcing you to pay to continue to use it. Like, I understand that they need to make money off of it, but this seems like a slimy way of going about it. Definitely lowers this company in my estimation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,":( 7 days trial or nothing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Unclear directions to uninstall subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this is an amazing app! I love the guides and challenges it gives me on a daily and it helps me learn new things about myself and what I am capable of. I think anyone would love this app if they are trying to do something positive yet not stressful like many other apps I've tried. There is no forcefulness in this app or pressure everything is your own choice which is amazing! I'm thinking about keeping my premium!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Most habits I already do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good bite size coaching content."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has been great! I've been motivated to complete my chores and create better habits, the only thing I would like to see on the future is pre-set music practice tasks e.g. piano or guitar practice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have been using Fabulous for three months now and have made a lot of progress with my goals. This is a really great app if you need some help, some life coaching. Even if you don't, this is a wonderful app for just improving yourself. I had been ill for quite some time and just doing the regular day-to-day day things had become extremely difficult. Fabulous has been gently supporting and coaching me into an even better life than I had before. I am very grateful for that."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This app is a sham. The habit building process is incredibly superficial, I'm better of with my paper Bujo tracker. They also charged me two subscriptions back to back. After I cancelled I received an email saying that my subcription of $40 has been cancelled and that I will have an active account until April 4th. Then surprize, on March 19th, they try to take $40 out of my account. They added two separate subcriptions on my account. Why? How is this not on purpose to scam people?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I just wish there were more things for free to build habits that just drink water"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome and highly recommend to all my friends and family."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This looked like it would've been great! I love all the motivational help they let you setup. It seemed pretty basic, and that's what I like. You do have to pay for it. It's only 3.33 a month, but I just don't want to pay for something. Really nice looking, though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is the best app ever. Very easy to use and it is very motivational. I find that I complete more tasks using this app. One bad thing about it is that if I forgot to complete the checklist for the previous day, the tasks stay undone even though I did them so I can't properly check my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It Fabulous is helping me to plan my day and live a healthier life. :D"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"App is good, but I have deducted a point as it keeps asking me to rate the product even though I already have and that is really irritating"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really helping during times when i cant imagine caring for myself. Cried tears of joy/feeling cared for through the app. Definitely taboo but worth it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"¬£37.99 instant yearly charge !!!!!!!!!! for a planner app that you could get free anywhere on gplay. what a ripoff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me keep myself in working order"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It's very disappointing to say that a bug which was reported about 4 month back is still not rectified. Very poor experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Should not have to pay for something that is supposed to help you feel better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a very good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! It gives you small goals and, even though they are small, you feel really good about yourself after completing a goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice. Positive and happy appy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The greatest app imo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Wow just because I forgot to check off my bedtime routine and the date changed by the time I had, my streak was reset and I had to start over and couldn't go back. Unreal! I like the app, but this is ridiculous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome customer service ü¶ã"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far it's been helpful and motivating me to get things accomplished."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Obnoxious alarms continue to pop up even after I complete a task! I have to push that I've completed something at least 10 times in one day, and some days that STILL doesn't make the alarms stop! it's really annoying and I'm confused about how I'm supposed to build a good habit if I'm getting credit for completing one task multiple times in one day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled but still being charged for it. Can someone contact me please and cancel my subscription completely as I am not happy to be paying for it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is really helping me go through the day and take care of myself"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loveee"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been helping by providing motivational tools to get into a routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Worth the yearly subscription! Great app that helps every area of my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is an absolutely amazing app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for something to keep me on track, set goals and reminders with. This all does it flawlessly, with rewarding noises, notes, and stories! I have not paid for the full version yet as I don't have much money, but I hope to buy it. Thank you developers for this wonderful app, it is beautiful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My ADHD spacebrain really appreciates this app. Like most of us, integrating what I already know to be helpful into my everyday life feels overwhelming and has resulted in a whole lot of stagnation. This app starts small and has enough components to keep me interested and motivated. There's positive reinforcement (daily/nightly coaching), logistical planning (alarm clocks), flexibility to tailor the path to your life, gorgeous graphics, and engaging storytelling snippets. This app gives me hope"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Helps so much! I have recommended this app several times! I think it's the best goal and routine developing app so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps me stay on track and create some new habits. It's also fun and pretty"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why every mental health helping app has to cost. this is what's wrong with the world. the love of money will ruin us all."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My first date added 8 routines I can achieve. On my way towards my goals. Happiness is mine to have!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've maintained my mood throughout the day with no outburst I feel like I'm really owning my life now. This is truly a different app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Its a nice way to help you get back on track after going off the beaten path. Sometimes it seems the app doesnt update itself. Though that may be me, not getting to the notifications on time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"*YOU CANNOT MANAGE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION VIA GOOGLE PLAY OR IN THE APP* Even if you cancel your subscription via Google Play and get an email to confirm, they will still charge you unless you follow a convoluted process on their website. This is not obvious or highlighted and seems suuuuuuper sketchy. As you can easily see from other reviews, it's not uncommon for this app to charge you after you cancel the subscription if you don't follow their nonsense process, ignoring Google Play."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Okay now listen, you do have to purchase a subscription for this BUT! ITS WORTH IT. I have ADHD and am trying to get my mind back on track and this little app has really helped me work on that. It was the best oopsy I payed for a subscription that could have happened to me ü§£üòÇü§£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a fanstatic app.I love it soooo much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have adhd, so these gentle and motivating reminders to do the things I really want and need to do are extremely helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I downloaded it. Even if I write my e-mail, i cannot press continue button :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled, they charged me for one more year, no refund. Not fair. I wasn't using it and Iam not planning on. This is not the way to go with customers."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Nice idea but unnecessarily persistent - haven't touched the app in weeks, get 7 separate notifications over a 1 minute period every day. Including two persistent just because I haven't used the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Apesar De que la aplicaci√≥n es en ingl√©s dar√° Buenos motivos para crear una buena y pedidos positiva rutina"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Shady company. I deleted the app before I even did their free trial because there was not a monthly subscription price and I'm broke. I didn't think anything of it until tonight it charged me the full year subscription!! I haven even been on it, didn't even try it for 7 days, so I re downloaded the app to see if I could close my account but I had to do the whole thing over again where it will probably take more of my money. It's not showing in my goggle subscriptions either . Lame"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like it i need to keep it updated daily alot of it is wht i already do, but i feel like it will help me understand what to improve on and also i might add it does take while to understand how it works"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I started Fabulous back in April 2020 and it helped me regain a sense eof peace I so dearly needed ‚ù§Ô∏è. I recently began using the app once again, this time purchasing a year of Premium. I am blown away at how quickly I am reminded to start small, keep my goals real and how reconnecting with my internal peace is attainable at any given time. I LOVE FABULOUS!! Happy positive affirmations everyone!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very lovely app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"used it before, and unfortunately stopped. here i am again to build myself up once moreüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I love it i think? Confused and overwhelmed right now. It is hard to keep up as I rarely use my phone but am always on the computer. Would love to be able to track this as an app on desktop! Will update rating when I get further into my journey :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me take action in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a really good app but it would be better with more free things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like this app! It helps me. The only flaw that made me put this on 4 stars is the fact that a lot of things are behind the paywall. You can't even have more than 4 goals without premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very helpful, beautiful and unique app, sometimes a little too 'busy' on the screen."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply fabulous üíú‚úåÔ∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It got fixed thank you‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ii have only just started but am enjoying it immensely. So far, so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Amazing app I love it. The app helps me with self care."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very useful. I would like a place for a to do list on it. Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a amazing app and they provide many routine and so osam ü•≥ü•≥"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Awsome üíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app looks great. Unfortunately, the first challenge - drink water after wake up for 3 days - is not really challenge as I do it every day. I don't want to waste half of trial time like that. There should be option to skip unwanted tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"A great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like daily reminders and it's better than surfing the socials first thing in the morning"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love This App ü§ç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!! Really enjoying this app. Exactly what I was looking for to create healthy Habits!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The UI is not intuitive and the jargon like ""Journeys"" is not clear. I went here to have a concise simple way to gamify my progress and the app has so much learning friction. Another huge con is how restrictive and uncostomizable it is. I would love to have multiple journeys going at once and then have the app offer ways to combine or graph each of their progresses. Also the animations between processes are really slow and take way too much time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It wants my fingerprint! That's creepy, I'm uninstalling after I post this. I'll give it another go ONLY if you change it to give us an option to opt out of providing the fingerprint."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It needs some advance feature tho ."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app loses points for asking me to rate it and then directing me to preloaded, prewritten review, complete with stars. YUCK! Here's what's good about the app: it reminds you to think about the things you want to make yourself do but feel too ughhhh to actually do. When I feel sluggish about my chores, meals, excercise, etc., Fabulous gets me to get off me bum and do them, simply because tracking them lets me feel good about checking them off my list. That makes it easier the next day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's is too good app , keep going , you guys made fabulous as fabulous app .... I think it's best app ever design.. thank you so much.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not worth my time or money! Many of the features like the music and long rambling speeches was not effective for me. Annoying!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app! Even without premium it still helps me to build up good habits ^^ Defenitely one of the best app I have used so far. Totally recommended"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unobtrusive payment structure and good advice and push notifications to keep me on track."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Exceptional"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It took a little getting used to at the beginning. I'm finally figuring it out after about 3 days. Fine tuning tryed to go to fast like I always do, but slowed down and breathed. I feel more relaxed and focused now. Thanks"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app looked really great but I never got to use it. It pops up in the free apps, is free to download, and then it changes tune real fast. It's only the first 7 days which are free. That's fine, it gives people the opportunity to see what it's about and whatnot, and still pays the creators. What I don't like is that in order to use your 7 days free trial you are forced to put your payment information in right away. Why is that? Seems kind of like a scam, to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm back to TheFabulous. Nothing better out there! This app has helped me develop new habits, and I'm making measured, consistent changes where I want to in my life. It's very easy to customize to the things you'd like to add, or, you can follow their suggestions for some positive changes. The reminders are not annoying at all, and the trackers are very helpful. The coach is just encouraging enough to keep me motivated. Thanks to all the developers and staff who've made this an exceptional app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I didn't get pass giving my email and nothing. Like it froze or something"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I'm in love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was trying it out, and liked it so far, but it won't accept my card for the free week and premium, even though no one else has had a problem with it and there was more than enough, and the free version only lets me add 4 items to a routine list. Not worth the trouble."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app itself seems pretty good, but the problem is you can only test the fully functional app if you're in agreement of the 7 Day trial. Impossible to even get through Day 1 without it taking me to the trial period, put down your CC (billed annually). I'm sure a lot of opportunities being lost due to this pay structure. Suggestion: full functionality of the app for 7 days, at the point you offer an upgrade to continue using all the features. It's a habit forming app. If it works, they'll buy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the consistency help. I have some good habits and I've added more while learning new ways to fit my own into a manageable fun filled life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best hdbxbx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It is good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"gets the job done, but i feel like its a bit intrusive. its also annoying how you can only set 4 tasks in the free version. other than that, its pretty good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Inspirational and motivational application that will ignite yourself to continue growing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gets youstarted and nice overall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far the free version has helped me so much already. Took 3 tries but it finally clicked. On week 3 going strong. Will probably buy the premium subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An amazing app a, great help in setting focus and helping to achieve my goals"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only just started using this app but already I am making good changes to my habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good coach. Helps bring balance through building healthy habits. Seems difficult for an app to do that, but if you let it, the impact is undeniable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its very motivating and a good interactive app I love it so far I'll put more if a review in in a month from now to tell you how I feel then okay but I really like the app so far as I am now ttys bye talk to you in 30 days from today's date bye xoxo"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scammed by the free trial system - got free trial found app useless and then wasn't able to cancel on the app? And wasn't able to log in on the web (said browser wasn't supported for chrome and any others I tried...). Conveniently this issue seemed to be resolved as soon as I had been charged for the full dam year having barely touched the app and had the free trial expire..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why do they need the user finger print?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It stacks on email i uninstalled it n reinstall it a lot of times but it wouldn't work"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing and helps me stay organized, but i must say it is a problem that you need premium to have more options. It's good in the end"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this App its fabulous:)I love theres lots to do and discover ..i would suggest giving us a heads up at the end of meditations as it's rather abrupt coming out of them. also a month to month subscription would be nice ..the yearly is rather pricey all at once .."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great. Having a habit list really disciplines you into following through with beneficial choices in your lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The pay wall is what ruined it for me. I'm a kid and I just wanted something so that I can lose some weight. I'm gonna try to find another app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"really usefull"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The Name as the content, Fabulous!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is such a wonderful app, it has allowed me to slowly improve and helps me get things done even with my ADHD."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Baby steps to better habits. I love everything about this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid if you struggle with disordered eating. I was careful to not select anything food oriented in my goals yet it immediately suggested I fast 2 days per week, cut out sugar, and only eat from a list of select foods for breakfast. I really wish I could find a healthy habit building app that isn't a diet app in disguise. Deleted after 2 days, not worth the mental anguish."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app helps you in amazing ways xxx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very engaging...look forward to the daily prompts and coaching"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Not much to be said. I needed something like this in my life. It is very useful and I am already feeling better in myself. Its a very good system to apply in life. 10/10"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very unique good app for staying on track but not doing too much and getting overwhelmed. Great motivation and visuals to keep you positive. I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am happy to be the user of fabulous appüíú i have changed a lot in a day, i can't believe myself i am happy for my changes and i am thanking fabulous team."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I cancelled before they could charge me for my subscription and yet they still took my money, do not use this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Yeah pretty garbage in terms of cancling payment, I want to quit during this weeks premium trail but can't. I'm going to be charged ¬£35 because unsubscribing is too hard. App is also very girly and star sign speak not for men really."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Having an amazing experience with this cute motivational app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far my journey has been awesome! But I really wish that there was more that standard users could do :/"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty excellent way to make sure you are taking care of yourself, starts off easy and keeps things simple. Would be nice if the relaxing rain souns/ambience music could be accessed more easily though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried to cancel before subscription and there is no way to do it They charged 40$. The so called subscription does not exist in play store yo cancel. The website does not allow login . It is a SCAM APP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i am getting the help i also need, thank you fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A gentle nudge in the right direction With a lot of emphasis on empathy for self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very uplifting, not pushy or graded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is helpful üôÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"this app has changed my life and mindset I have better mornings and better nights, I highly recommend it <33"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"As someone with ADHD I forget to do any self care even if my alarms are set to remind me. Fabulous gently reminds me to do those tasks like hydrate, brush my teeth, take car of my skin, take my meds and gives that extra need to check off the boxes and keep progressing through their little map showing my progress for each day I completed. So if you are neurodivergent and have a need to check off things on a list and not lose your progress along with reminders I definitely recommend this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app was good but the payment is worst it still deducts even though you cancelled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"how can i cancel if i want?:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous is absolutely fabulous üòç"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the personal coaching I have wanted all my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best APP I've ever stumbled upon."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous is a little expensive for me since I am unable to work due to my autoimmune disease. I am in the process of filing for disability."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App. Have used it everyday and love how it has helped my every day improve! Have yet to encounter any issues with the app. Definitely recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: I've been using it for several months and have felt and seen changes in my behaviors and perspectives. I'm gentle with myself and others. I've sent several guest passes b/c I love it so much! ORIGINAL: I really feel like I'm making progress on new habits with this app. I like the UI & reminders. I love that coaching sessions can be read AND listened to. Different voices are great. More options for listening vs reading, pls. Used it as is for a few days and upgraded to premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did the free trial and cancelled before my free trial ended but somehow I still got charged even though I didn't have the subscription anymore and I wasn't able to find out how to talk to a REAL person who could help me fix this issue I have the email that says my plan would end on the 17th so what happened to that?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm a few weeks in and I love it so far. Sounds clich√©, I started noticing changes instantly. Love it, great app that doesn't really even feel like an app. Few things could do with refining etc hence the 4. Downloaded this ages ago amongst others but rediscovered as I was scrolling through my app list procrastinating cleaning, icon thing caught my eye. I'm so glad that this happened to be the app I stumbled upon. Grateful I think actually. So thanks! Have made many recommendations already üòÖ"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has in app purchases but definitely what gives as counsel and coaching helps to break the procrastination habit"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Quite a handy tool when trying to figure out things"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very encouraging"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Too costly for what it is not worth it spend more time on the app than forming habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Expected, ""we care about a better you, now pay us if you do too!"" Yeah you have to give them money to tell you what you already know just don't wanna do."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very motivational and I feel like I could get up from bed and have a great day definitely recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I found this beneficial at first, but struggled to commit the first few months with any frequency. Then I went through a phase that felt too restrictive (me rebelling), even canceling my account. About a month ago however I decided I wanted to try again (after reading up about Stoicism) and reinstalled. I have not looked back, and feel I am really building sustainable habits now. Try it. It might be a game changer for you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have deeply appreciated the daily messages that relate to the areas I'm trying to improve in my life. Thank you for this experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fine"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful app, I love it and it literally changed my life thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Useful for the past 3 days. Really could use a widget to allow me to check my lists off without opening the app. Would be neat if you could set tasks on the app to link to another app (like I click on my meditate task and it opens headspace)."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the step by step guide to building self care habits. It helps me prioritize my day to take care of me."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very uplifting and keeps me on track to be a better me!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Other apps that are free that do the same thing. This cost $40! I forgot to cancel my free trial 2 days to late since I didn't like it and they charged me I tried to get a refund and other companies I've never had issues when when missing the cancel date so close but they will not refund me. It's a waste of $40."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful mix of behavioural and spritual work- 2021 . Addit 2022 I really didnt want to let it go but have cash flow problem for funds to cover at end this month so cant do renewal on time, cancelled ok in Google Play but really would prefer to have had a temporary break and not lose all my history data journeys etc - I will come back as soon as I can, just sad to lose all my previous work. üò¢"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Just trying to sell premium The system begins asking questions to create a custom routine for you. As soon as you complete it says ""unlock premium to access your custom routine."" Uninstalled it already"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is the first time I ever paid money for an app and I'm glad I did. The customer service is fast, understanding and really kind! The app supported me in getting my life togehter and creating my routines, but on the other you have to be willing to do that from the beginning. Otherwise this app isn't going to help either. It's not some kind of magic. Navigation through the app is a little weird, but the important stuff (the routines) are easy accessable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"When I install and try and put it email the app bugs out and won't let me continue. Pathetic."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is very helpful! I only have the free version so far but it's what I needed. I have a hard time building a good routine and holding myself accountable. I also hate doing chores so this app will help me get done at least the bare minimum so I don't fall behind and get overwhelmed and enter that cycle of not doing anything lol"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried several times, it wouldn't load...froze up several times. I finally gave up and removed it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible app buggy as can be, causes my whole phone to freeze and be completely unusable until I restart the whole thing. This happens every time I get a notification from the app. Attempted to get my money back since I can't use the app without pulling out my hair in frustration and they make it impossible to get your money back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this headache at all costs. Edit! Yeah so I contacted yall and the only thing you offered was for me to Uninstall and reinstall"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a dope tool an cool way to look an develope insight and improve that which you choose to improve üòÄ. I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Confirm improvements but very expensive."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Dont subscribe! It is kind of app you can't unsubscribe but they can charge u! I ve just paid them ¬£ 35 and I am not using it and I can't unsubscribe. If you know how I can cancel please help me. This money will make a huge difference in my life."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ú®Amazing‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a terrible money grabbing app. I wanted to try this app as I've heard from their reviews that it helped a lot of people. However I saw that it was not the right fit for me as there was a lot going on, so I canceled the subscription and trial. However they just charged me today for the yearly subscription. I'm annoyed that they kept my information and decided to charge me anyway even though I canceled it (with screen shots the cancellation, and emails calling me back after the cancel)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had a 22 day streak going and lost all the progress when I restarted the app to fix an issue of the journey getting stuck. I felt very disappointed, but decided to start it over. I tried again and lost ot again. I know I should feel happy because technically I just got a 30 day streak this morning, but I look at the app and feel disappointed. I already did contact support when it first happened and still haven't heard back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is very helpful but I wish they had a tutorial on how to use it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription through play. Just been charged 34.99. Says they will contact me in 10 days. Not good enough"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"May you kindly stop deducting subscriptions as i have cancelled my subscription.i do not know how to contact you to have this remedied.it is disturbing that this app keeps attempting to deduct the subscription fee from my bank even if i cancelled"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"That is great app.Very encouraging.It feels that somebody is with you in you journey to healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is amazing and I am enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Absolutely life changing!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app has been really good with giving me ideas to add to my ongoing habits. A few habits that I wanted to get better at was made easier using this app. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is that you are limited to how many habits you can add to a routine. I know you can buy the subscription to add more habits, and i respect this decision as this gives the developers more money, but I wish you could watch ads to put more habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Complete scam. I signed up for the free trial, hated the app so I then unsubscribed so I wouldn't be charged... They charged me anyways and not just for the month but for the whole year! I would give 0 stars if I could"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Definitely is keeping me engaged. I'll update once it's been 30 days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good as a reminder and accountability tool, especially if you're like me and struggle to keep yourself on track for good habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ever since i downloaded it, i started feeling better. It's helping me finding a healthy routine i can stick to, because it's me who creates it. And through all the challenges and lessons, I'm learning to love myself back again, small steps at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Okay app but not worth the ¬£4 in my opinion"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just an extra push of motivation to do the things you already know you should be doing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Everytime it appears the message that you can advice someone about habits and you write the paragraph and press the button send, the app disconnects and I can't send my advices to other people."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is VERY HELPFUL"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just trying it out so far I'm really enjoying it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Do not trust this app. I had this installed at one point and signed up for a year (my mistake I agree). I didn't use the app the whole year. This year in 2022 the subscription renewed and they charge me 58$ although I didn't use this app. When I asked for a refund they didn't approve it. It's a scam."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They will over charge you and double charge you and it's impossible to get ahold of customer service. So disappointed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love the app, the content and presentations. The graphical works and arrangements, I just love it. I think for me the creators went a long way in trying to make the app get closer to the users, as in play that role of a true and reliable companion that even most real life people couldn't do on a great scale. I'm amazed and also impressed. It was much and I love it. Not like... Love it. Thank you all for this wonderful work, thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great motivator and coach UI kinda wonky but tolerable, otherwise 5 start"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Im still in the beginning stages, but I have to say, I really like this app so far. Ive wanted to establish good sleep hygeine for my health and well being, but struggled in my own. Fabulous's accountability and encouragement has helped me establish a comfortable, realistic bedtime routine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I just love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A positive experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Guided and just what i needed to boost myself. I like the automatic suggestions on what to improve n how"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"For now really helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Coming from a rough childhood and a tour in the military this has been super helpful in helping me start a routine thank you guys"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"awesome concept, but as usual too complicated and way too many ads and prompts for ads. almost unusable. pity. if you really want to help people, don't be so greedy and just reduce to amount of ads to a reasonably low and non-intrusive way."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Muy bien"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"so far, so good!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only been using the app for three days but loving it and can see huge potential and benefits within it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I can see how the app would be useful for certain people but it was too rigid for my own personal use. The app insisted I exercise first thing in the morning. I had to lie and say I did it at that time and not when I actually exercise (at a time that suits me) for the journey to progress. Similarly as a previous insomniac I know that a pitch black room is not at all conductive to me getting a good night's sleep. So yet again I had to lie to progress, it lost a bit of credibility from there."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The text doesnt show up"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely enjoy this app. One question how can I access the nightly coaching stories from the previous day? They are so beautiful and peaceful! Thank you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app helps me manage my habits and rituals that enable me to be the best version of myself. Thanks for creating this wonderful application. It's really helped me manage my thought patterns that have hurt me most of my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app, organized, positive, mtoivating. I was even thinking of buying premium. Fair price, good offers, I rly love this app üíãüíì"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is simply.... Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app! Been using it for about a week and half now and it's really helped me form habits I've been struggling with. The results were pretty much instantly noticable! The coaching is great and the stories truly interesting, inspirational and thoughtprovoking. I look forward to the rest of the journey! Props to the developers ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Would not go further than putting email in.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very cool and soft , this app recognize my time and healthy lifestyle"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is well designed but it costs to much money"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm loving this app! It's not pushy or overwhelming. And I feel proud of myself for accomplishing Daisy tasks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I really do love this app!! However the only downside is to be able to use the app to it's full potential you have to pay for it, it doesn't cost much at all. I will say tho even without paying for the premium version it does help me stay focused on my goals for the day! It's really easy to use and if you choose to pay for the full app you can customize your routine much more in depth. I like simple so I actually enjoy only having a few things to check off each day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is very good and helped me a lot. Problem is for everything it needs premium"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me get through my depression, I have never been more healthier and happier before!! I feel so much more motivated to keep going with life! I recommend this app to anyone who is ready to make their life better for themselves ‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love it, its positive, realistic and easy to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect for me, make my schedule, thanks."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is bogus, some nonsense automated help. There is no option for what happened to me. I literally deleted your app after never using it and was billed for the free trial. I want someone to reach out to me, your contact form is bs"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Human garbage"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so great üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm only 4 days in but so far this app has been very helpful! I was looking for something to help me take better care of myself, and the step by step, habit by habit method is so much more manageable than the others that throw everything at you at once - I'm using the free version at the moment, but I very well might subscribe if things keep going the way they are!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app that guides you to building good habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is controlling me üòäüòäüòÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Exceptional, thumbs up üëçüèΩ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I feel it's disrespectful to make canceling the subscriptions so hard. Why can't it just be in the app? You have to go the website to cancel and even there it's not straight forward. If I want to or need to cancel I will no matter how tricky you make it. However you did make it so annoying that I won't ever want to try this app again, even if me cancelling had nothing to do with how good your product is. For some people the cost of the subscription is a lot. Especially since it's at once."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome superb"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app I used to have it on every new phone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a positive tool to work my way to serenity! It's like I have a work out buddy!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Haven't tried it yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is not just an app. This is more of a supportive friend, a rare one to find. Keep this gem in your phone and see the positivity flows within you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The sound design is what really makes this app shine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to press continue after entering my email"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Two months in and I'm loving the app! Daily coaching is great; habits after there to remind me every day since I'm feeling too busy to keep up on my own."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great great great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app, uplifting, easy to use and great for building a healthier lifestyle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"habit tracker but helps you activate keystone habits that will affect your life in ways you can't imagine."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app, so easy to use and building great new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I previously left 3 star review based on the fact that I was charged twice and was given the impression it would take 10 days for a response. I'm changing that as it only took 1 day. I was emailed by customer service and had all my money refunded. Excellent service from those I spoke to and honestly the app is brilliant. Easy to use and helped me reach personal goals. I only stopped using it is because the amount of tasks I needed to do in one day got too overwhelming at this stage."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They didn't warn me when the trail period was expiring. I read that was an issue but when they told me they would remind me, and because it's an organizational app, I figured they would follow through. They didn't and I wasted $50 on this. Given the users who would want to use the app (someone trying to learn organization, for example) this seems predatory."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app to use for my day to day activities"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing it keeps on track everyday it's a 5 star"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Don't trust this app. I tried the 7 day free trial to see if I would like it and 2 days later i canceled my subscription and got an email confirming I canceled yet they still charged me $49.99."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, just like it's name it makes me feel ‚ú®fabulous‚ú®"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me out and I love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app, download"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The way it has a calming voise thats helps the user and because of that its really user frendly"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"All in all, its a good app. But i do think the team can improve it by adding certain features that can support the habits, like with the guided runs for morning exercises. Maybe add your shopping list for healthy groceries or audiobook, podcast recommendations for the evening ""Disconnected"" practices. I know these are all hardwork but will be hugely beneficial to the users if you want to improve the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2nd day and am loving this. Can't wait to see next week this time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Still lovely and does what it promises. No longer free, and quite overt with the selling. Hence 4 üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you have any issues with their system charging, or overcharging you, just be patient. They will fix it. I was getting frustrated because I felt like I wasn't being heard, but they're constantly working on improving things. I appreciate the time taken to fix my issue. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good motivational app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I dont like this program. Cool idea, not customizable enough. Like namimg alarms. Choosing remimders for certain days of the week. Choosimg the duration of the new activoties you add. Thise would all be features that would make this app practically applicable"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its,creates a sense of fulfillment through the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ô°‚ô°best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ace. Try it, you will easily guided to a happier you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far but deciding whether to continue"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tried to delete the subscription for hours. It shouldn't be this hard. No-one has gotten back to me to assist me! This is how companies like this make money. I have gone to google play, I have emailed them for support, gone to FAQ. Please unsubscribe me!!! I joined on the 13th Mar."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just downloaded on Sat. 3 days in . . . Great So Far!üëçüèΩ I do have a suggestion already though. üòä‚òùüèæü§î For the EMOTIONAL CHECK UP habit, instead of just the 1 question of ""What could you do if you weren't weighed down by heavy feelings?"" IMO it would be helpful to have an ""Emotions Dictionary"" or List of Emotions and/or Feelings to choose from so I could have a little assist to jot down more specifically what I'm feeling that day & then move into 1 or 2 Prompts to facilitate that section!üòâüôå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ilove this app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A excellent way to make positive changes and personal growth."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful application"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Just getting started. But I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Maybe I'm just a boomer but I can't find how to make notifications more noticable, that's my only complaint for this app. I was already on my journey to find my peak health and wellness and this is like a little rocket booster for that journey!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't access the appüôÑ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nope. Stay away. Money grab. Horrid experience. Technical issues and poor customer support. Enjoyed at first then had issues. Wouldn't record progress or display properly. At times app wouldn‚Äôt open, goals un-selectable, or unlocked material inaccessible. After premium issues worsened, requested refund describing issues, they responded ‚Äúno, you agreed to pay, no refund will be issued.‚Äù I agreed to pay for features I did not get, therefor they did not live up to their end of the agreement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I like the aesthetic and the approach the app takes. I just hope I can do my part!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I get a bit in and supposed to put in finger print, everything freezes and I cannot put the finger print in so.it freezes."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Can't say for long term yet, but short term this app has really helped me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Was gonna purchase, until I seen the reviews"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged me without a notice and now it's impossible to contact them about it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful little app. I'll definitely continue using it!üíù"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great appüòòüòòüòò"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lovely motivating app. I look forward to opening the app for the morning and evening stories, encouragement and joy."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Would have been better if I could add more option with free account"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Keeps freezing when I try to press any of the buttons"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's helping me get into routines. With the reminders it really does help"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Inspirational!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed, but didn't know it. Very good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"What a beautiful app filled with a narrative story that inspires"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Installed this in my tablet but I am having touchscreen issues everytime the notification from this app pops up. A portion of the lower screen won't respond to touch. Issue is only resolved if I force stop the application through app settings."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helping me get threw life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It solved all my problems like my energy my grades etc. Definitely recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It just doesn't work. Freezes on a startup"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional application this is a must have"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ITS SOOO CUTE AND FUN GREAT FOR MINDFULNESS"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Took me awhile to figure out how to navigate this app and learn how to not rush into too many habits or changes at once..but I love it..its great..slow and steady if you just relax and follow your promps and reminders..highly recommend for anyone especially those suffering from depression or ADHD or executive functioning issues etc etc"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The weekly check-ins boost my confidence and set tone for the coming week and the daily and nightly coaching sessions are really comforting. I'm not a fan of having to check of every step in my routine as I complete it, though. I want to rely less on my phone to get through the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app its the best i think if you have habit get it right now its helping me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What is it with apps that say ""free"" on the play store, then you load them up and it's a subscription service? It's misleading. I'm here to try and improve my life, not make some greedy, manipulative liars rich. You want to convince me that your app will *actually* help me and not just drain my wallet? Make it free, or at least a one time payment, not a subscription service. As a subscription, your best course of action is to retain users, not actually help them. This is unethical imo."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's slow paced so far which I'm grateful for because it is really crucial when trying to rebuild trust in yourself to accomplish your goals and habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is purely awesome. The only thing is that that popup is now working on my device. But despite that this app is exceptional and really helps"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app is such a nice place to be. I've been on it for a month now and I've already seen change in my mood, my skin and my body:) This is an amazing app to reach your goals and change your life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice like having a friend who is on the journey but doesn't tell all your other mates down the pub üòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The format can be a little confusing but I like the apps goal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Great concept, abysmal execution. Two weeks is nowhere near enough time to know whether it's worth it or not. The app becomes downright infuriating, and just trying to use the app is a huge time waster. It actively makes me hate building routines or bothering with self-improvement."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"This app is really nice but the problem is premium. Everything is to be unlocked through premium and I don't wanna use my money. There's only a 7-day üÜìtrial"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a good app If you have time and wants to work on yourself this app is the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I had this app in it's early days and loved it, but fell out of habit using it. I tried again to find that the things I liked most are behind a paywall. I would consider paying it if it was more affordable and had monthly subscriptions."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is so amazing and it helped me to build better habits to improve myself!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Has so much to offer."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've been struggling horribly with self motivation and just taking care of myself in general. I thought this app could help me, but I wasn't aware there's a paywall."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful, it's just fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Obsessed with checkmarks! I want to be able to get into the app daily and check as many boxes as I can of the things I followed through with throughout my day. It keeps me on my toes! Great app! Really works!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Overall the app is beautiful and very useful, I recently had to cancel my subscription through because I've run into some financial issues and need to save money. My only gripe is that there isn't an ""other - please explain"" box when canceling your membership. I didn't want to have to pick ""I didn't feel like it was worth the cost"" option when canceling because it's inaccurate but it was the closest one to my actual reasoning of being broke lol."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I rated this app before because I thought highly of it . I don't know of how to cancel the app now and I don't have access to the premium I paid for. Please help. If I have been charged I would at least like to know how to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Includes short motivations and incremental changes with accountability"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very motivating and easy to keep your streak going."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DOWNLOADED AS IT DESCRIBED HOW IT WOULD HELP WITH MENTAL HEALTH & LIFESTYLE.... TAKES YOUR MONEY WHEN YOU HAVEN'T USED IT.Having depression, EPD and I'm AUTISTIC I thought this would really help i cant bearly use it and after a couple of days and due to my mental health found it annoying lost interest straight away. I was hospitalised when I installed this that's the sad thing in feel duped as I've realised it's taken 33 pound ITS SICK OFFER HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful with changing small.habits, better yourself rather than pour time into the mediaüíõ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A great way to make changes one step at a time"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Slow to display music was playjng everytime I opened the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am liking it so far, now I remember to do my daily habits alone"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What I'm really unimpressed with is the billing. When I downloaded it, even with the 7 day free trial, I had to put in my card details, they claimed that I would get a reminder at day 5 and day 7 in case I wanted to cancel. This did not occur. Then at day 7 instead of deducting the advertised amount, which was at a hefty discount, the whole annual fee was deducted! This is not cool! If you advertise a reduced fee - then charge that!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for your good üíñüëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, it's been going great so far and I'm loving every second of it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It was all good even for free version. But then can't help to feel a bit discouraged about some bugs that seems unfixed on Fabulous; missing 'done' button for certain tasks (which turns up randomly for some and some just don't), missing done button for letters, inaccurate streaks (e.g: you are on your 7th day but it marks you still at your 6th day) Please fix this issues. It is demotivating esp when you really give all the letters and motivations genuine focus to read. Thank you in advance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's just amazing app which makes u feel better and keep motivating nd i just liked it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why it's required credit card to use trial period. Trial should be free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"IT IS LIKE REINVENTING INNERSELF IN BEST POSSIBLE WAY"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Perfect for me i have extreme inability to stay organized and habitual and this is like the friend ive always needed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good for planning days no bad affects just fantastic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Easy 2 follow good app..."

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app for creating new habits and self care ! 11/10 recommend!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thoroughly disappointed, as it's not free. The premise is great, but once all the questions are answered, you realize you have to fork over some money. No thanks. Uninstalling."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful and cute I like the sound effects. The whole app gives you that let's do this feeling. It gives you encouragement to change and improve your life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been a good tool for me. I have ADHD and having these motivational reminders really help to stay on task as much I can with my basic necessities and even the fun things I like to do."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Been more helpful than I thought. The daily coaching really hits home."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent customer service turned my 1 star to a FIVE! Thank you Fabulous Team!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please don't market sth. for free if it truly isn't. Instant uninstall after that paywall past the intro. But thanks for letting me waste my time by inserting all my information first, really thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is the best way to get more productive, creative and I am a better person now thanks to this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Such a rip off don't get the subscription"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really nice app but give more things to those who can pay for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay organized and focused on the day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"great for thinking off and building new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Getting me off to a great start in creating meaningful and life long habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I'm usually a very disciplined person, but with a sick husband time for me is scarce. I have found the reminders are great for me to focus on myself, to take care of myself. I'm very happy with the app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"doesn't tell you it's going to cost money until it already has all of your information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't even try it without having to give CC information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app. I love the little insights and advises that are available in the free app. Love the animation and small reminders."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why is it so hard to unsubscribe??? I subscribed after I saw in on instagram thought it would be a simple, low cost way of reinforcing some simple habits. Wasn't impressed with the cost so I'm trying to unsubscribe. I've been through Google play (says I don't have a current subscription) and their app (nowhere to cancel!) It shouldn't be this hard....."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have been charged 3 times ¬£34.99 in one day from this app. This is unacceptable. I want my money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's honestly such a great app even without paying (which is the version I'm using at the moment) but even the fee is cheap! I loveeeee how put together I feel with it every day :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good so farüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"2 weeks in and doing great. I love the flexibility of this app. I also really like that it reminds you not to overdo it which can be very overwhelming. This app is amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't really do much without having to pay, and the ads are annoying"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"The app was functional and very nice during the trial. But this gets a low rating because I am upset about the subscription service. I can't unsubscribe! I have not used the app outside of the trial. I've tried multiple ways to cancel and prevent charges (in-app, fabulous website, online tutorial...) and they still try to charge me! I was fortunate enough to have my debit card balance declined the first time, but they tried it again three days later! How do I cancel my subscription??"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"There needs to be a ""pause"" button for illness . I was loving it and doing well, but then got slammed with a 3 week long illness that left me bedridden. It kept sending me messages asking me where I am (understandable) but then when I finally came back it wanted to know why. None of the options really applied. I picked ""unmotivated"" but that felt inauthentic. I couldn't even get up to shower... much less eat a healthy breakfast. Now I just feel guilty when I see the notifications."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has been that reminder I need to do those little things that equate to the start of a good morning. I love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wasn't expecting much coming from a Instagram ad I found but gosh this actually made me feel different"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This apps changed me a lotüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I accidentally paid for the subscription but I havn't used the app. My gcash account has been deducted P 2,050 because it was linked in my google account. I asked for a refund since i hav'nt used the app even for once but google refused to refund it for the reason that it does meet their policy. I hope you can help me to get my refund since you are a developer in this app.. Thank You!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Its a very amazing app I just wish it was all free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastique"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was really looking forward to using this app. It had great reviews, but the moment I needed support I was treated so bad I nearly cried. Insulted, patronised and gaslit. Not the way to get customers. The tone-deaf PR replies they gave both in mails and here are unhelpful and seek to cover their failures instead of helping their customers. I wish they were better. But they're not. Super disappointed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice app but not freee"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You want a fingerprint scan to start using the app? Without asking for any permissions or showing any terms of service? That's a hard ""nope"" from me. Not giving you my biometrics unless you tell me *exactly* what you're gonna do with them. üòÇüòÇ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gosh I love it so far <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app but if there wasn't this premium thing and was free I would have liked it even more."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This is definitely the app I'm looking for to help sort out my life do to manic depression. The only thing that I know a lot of people will and have gotten mad at is the $34.00 or some where around that fee. I initially thought it was only $3.00 a month for premium. Idk if I want to try it for a year yet. Wait like a week in or offer a monthly more manageable fee! Then it ill be perfect! And all those bad reviews I'll disappear. I hope you read this who ever is at fabulous. Your doing good!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am absolutely loving this app! I've only been using it for 4 days and in that time I have already reduced my screen time, started reading a new book, have set daily goals and new routines that are much more productive, and I'm loving the little mini coaching sessions that my phone reminds me of. I highly suggest this app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A lot of the stuff seems pretty simple to most people, but it works great for me. I'm autistic and I have ADHD so externalizing my routine like this has been really helpful to me."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"ùôÑùô©'ùô® ùôùùôöùô°ùô•ùô® ùô¢ùôö ùôßùôöùô°ùôñùô≠ ùôñùô£ùôô ùôòùôñùô°ùô¢ ùôôùô§ùô¨ùô£"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good!:)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has done wonders for my stress, anxiety, and time management already!! Couldn't recommend more!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous has seriously helped me ACTUALLY start doing the things I've wanted to for years. I've always known that I am not capable of self-starting. I'm ADHD and I need an outside force to prompt me to do things. And reminders set in my calendar never were enough. I would just ignore them or click them done and pretend it didn't happen. Somehow this app is the tipping point for me. I had everything lined up for all the things I've been wanting to do, I just couldn't ever get myself to do them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very great app and simple! I really like how we get to use things but some things are premium and when I click on them it shows me how to get a subscription. I would rather it have ""premium"" on the premium features so I won't click them.But overall it's a great app and I like it very much!Excellent job!üíó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A thoughtful approach to behavior change. I just started and I'm already feeling more optimistic about my capacity to improve and grow. I shared guest/gift passes with two friends I thought might benefit and they both are excited to start."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful experience."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I haven't had much time to go through all of it, but I've started using the app every day. It's the perfect, relaxed day planner."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you want to change your life for the better, fall into this"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is starting to give me discipline and remember water is important so every hour I'm drinking water that's amazing cuz sometimes you don't even do that so I love this app and I love that it gives you other options it's amazing doing the squats and giving you inspiration I'm going to be joining the gym next month and I think that this will help me I am setting goals and stuff and journaling again and I fell in love with a military man and he has this up too and we are doing stuff together thank"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Yet again an app that mentally tricks you 10 minutes that you neeeed this app before telling you to pay on a monthly basis. Such dishonesty deserves nothing but one star."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nicely designed app. I am just following along with it because I tend to either rush making lifestyle changes and do too much or not do anything at all. So I figure if I just stick with this and follow the steps I am at least doing something!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The UI and sounds are very calming and lively at the same time. Makes you want to explore the app. And the activities are great for making change easy and rewarding."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"An Actual Polished App. At first I thought it was just a app that puts reminders in the notifications. But it actually goes in depth and so much information is given to you. This app really helps me get better by starting small task like ""Drink water waking up"", 3 times a day, then it adds ""Eat a good breakfast"" and so on... Highly recommend it, the developers put so much effort into this app that it actually inspires me... Thank you Fabulous Daily Routine Planner Teams and keep it up!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Well it's a allright app I mean everyone drinks water everyday I've only had the app for the day and now it's telling me to fast which idk how but it doesn't explain the things I can't do"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm on day 3 and My experience thus far has been wonderful. There are interesting quotes, mystical stories, fun graphics and animations. I find the content encouraging, useful and uplifting. It's fun to do and easy to navigate. I look forward to doing this every day!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far great! Keeps me in a routine"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly the best self-help app out there by far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Ok, it does what it says: it sends you on your way with new routines created. But doesn't have many preset routines, those routines are that are preset come with material and help to get you an idea of how to do it. You can create your own without material. But what difference is it from writing them as a checklist on paper? Another thing, you can't have tasks at different times of day and on selected days of the week, you can only do that to the whole routine, and you can't have many routines."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"3 days strong using this app. It has so much to offer and many challenges to help you along your journey! I haven't seen 1 ad so far üòÅ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I really love the app but would MUCH prefer having the monthly payment option over paying 1 year at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tries to rope you into a yearly subscription plan after you have already made the personal 'commitment' to your routine. Monthly plan is buried in the website settings, nowhere to be found in-app, and is way too expensive (¬£12.99 per month instead of ¬£34 per year). Bad practice for an app allegedly designed to help people. It's also very girly and flowery looking and not particularly straight forward, it overwhelms you with 'journeys' that include loads of different elements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really nice app, I'm feeling positive with this üòå just a small suggestion tho, one feature you could add is within the journal habit ..you could add a feature to write the journal or to-do's since many people don't keep journals or don't know where to write/start‚ò∫Ô∏è Ok Edit I'm Sorry It Already Had The Feature I just hadn't found it yetüòÖ Amazing App‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Awful. Confusing to work. Over the top and don't notify you when they're gonna take your money. Now I have no money left and rubbish subscription to this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, cause it really helpsüíùüíù people should definitely go for it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please do not download this App if you have an eating disorder/ in recovery for eating disorders. There are elements of this app that reward you for intermitted fasting and triggers such as ""tea has zero calories so you can drink as much as you like and don't have to worry""."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Brillent app gets you motivated"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've come across."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Thank you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"if you need an app to tell you how to live every day , then you waste space on earth for nothing, the app it's overly complicated and stupid, oh and you have to pay, but I guess you can change your life if you ""drink 3 glasses of water "" bahahah. Useless"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So good so far I'll b back to write a more accurate review."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a great app that helps you get on the right track.‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charges you"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is a amazing app which make scenes about time and mental health ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I enjoy they way that it is guiding you to the process, I really do not how it is going to end but I spect the best"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. Suggests it's free, but the content is actually all paywall/in-app purchases."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just great that is all I can say"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is too busy to follow what is going on each day. I attempted to cancel prior to the ""trial"" period but there's no option on the site. I sent sn email but no one responded."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying using the app. It is Strategically designed to help make small changes that have a big impact. Small wins help with succeeding and I'm really pleased I purchased this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great program to build new healthier habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Thought this was going to be different. It is not a bad thing but just not what I expected and not what the advertising led me to believe it was. Mostly it just tells me everytime I open it to drink water, to make sure I am drinking water, to educate me on the benefits of drinking water. When I dont open it it notifies me that I should be drinking water, and that drinking water is good. With all my other goals that I have put in it does not pester me as much to achieve them."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so far, they make it easy to start small habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It helps me keep my day straight and full of energy!! Definitely recommend!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"""We will never interrupt you for rating."" Here are my 5 stars! ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Simply put.. it's Fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It a great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I tried this and while it was cute, did not provide a reasonable value for the price. I've tried to cancel it but everytime I go to the page to end my subscription it crashed and loops me back to the home page. It mysteriously does the same thing with the context is link on their web page."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It doesn't have a clear way to cancel before trial is over"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"only free for a week"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Loved"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate you made this app. Its helping me through my difficult times. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's pleasure using it for few mins."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Thankfully I used PayPal! 2 days in I wasn't a fan of the app. Then it says you have to go online to your account to cancel (the opposite of productivity) and when I do, it kept telling me my PW and username were wrong. 2 days I tried, tried to contact, it kept bringing me to broken links. Finally I went and stopped payment with PayPal and uninstalled the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"This app claims to take a scientific approach, however the first thing I was questioned about was my gender and it had more than two options. So ridiculous. It's Male or female there are no more choices according to science and common sense. App loses creditability"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app for inspiring you to better yourself and pursue personal goals. It takes a little to figure out customizing it (hit the + sign under the habits), but once you've got it figured, you can set it to coach you in your own direction. Ads will pop up from time to time encouraging a subscription, which I'm sure has some worthy offers, but if you just want very basic encouragement, there's plenty you can use free. I haven't had any issues like mentioned in other reviews."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Only had it for two days but I can already tell that it's helping me. I like it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's abit confusing and alot going on when you first download the app but if you stick at it then this app will help you so much!! It really helps get those habits stuck instead of doing a new task for a few days and giving it up, it helps you stay focused on it! Just download it and you'll see what I mean!! Great app!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Incredible app. I'm able to keep track of of schedules and be consistent with my habbits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy prompts I don't feel overwhelmed! Encouraged Daily and motivated to do more Extremely easy Great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not what I wanted, unsubscribed within the time. Then: they CHARGED MY PAYPAL $40. when they offered a refund, they charged my bank account $36. I can't afford this abuse."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far it's an engaging way to improve and starts off at a nice pace"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Way too much jargon that isn't explained. Fancy words for ""schedules"" and ""habits"" and way less intuitive than other personal progress apps. No option to disable sound from the launch page. Lots of fluff not enough help. Also, I was charged for two licenses back to back when I only signed up for one. Surprise to see a $15 charge for the free trial than a $40 charge for a yearly. Edit: I've already contacted support and gone through the awful process of trying to get a refund. No response"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"ABSOLUTE SCAM - STOLE MY MONEY I signed up for 1 month for 1 dollar thinking I would use the trial to see if I enjoyed it or if it helped me. It didn't so I went to cancel within a week and they charged me over $50 for an entire year???"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for building your habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very friendly motivating app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Its easy to use and navigate. I have enjoyed it so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The fact that my first review said I tried to cancel my subscription BEFORE the free trial ended and they still reply saying they are upfront about the charges... No you are not!! I tried to cancel more than 5 times BEFORE the free trial ended. It was literally IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL. Thank god Paypal reimbursed me but still worried the damn app and the money hungry people will probably keep charging me each year. And it's pretty sad that when going through reviews, this is a VERY common thing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love it. Please make the bedtime stories section But."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Automatically started subscription and charged my Google Play payment method Edit for developer reply: Thanks, but those options don't help if someone isn't using the app. I think it's a little predatory to automatically charge after the trial ends, without getting user confirmation (e.g. I stopped using the app midway through the trial)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A real fun and informative app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is as fabulous as its name. This application helps me to change my habbits and i improved myself."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"App is incredibly buggy and froze 3 seperate times in just setting it up. I was also made to register several times and put in my information several times. If they are going to charge this much they should at least invest some of it in their quality assurance."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! I like the philosophical quotes and references to old times. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Would have been great if it includes more free habits. Currently only three are possible. Otherwise it is a good app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It won't let you check off things you already have a habit of. So, you waste time checking off a habit you already have..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"What a joke. Avoid at all costs. If your policy is that If you go 1 minute past the 7 day trail we take your year subscription its a clear red flag that you don't stand by the product and are just using predatory tactics to get people to sign up. For an app espousing mental health, you sure do a good job of negatively impacting vulnerable people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible I tried the 7 day ""free"" trial subscription and then they charged me for a whole year trial without my consent or knowledge .. i wouldn't recommend anyone To try this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app, so positive and becomes a habit to use it every day which is great. Although I'm not a premium member, it's still a good experience with plenty of features. Their instagram page is also super helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The way subscriptions are set up is verging on criminal. I received an email that my $10 ""pay what you want"" subscription had been cancelled on February 27th. When I log on to my Paypal account I see that I was charged $39.99 on February 25th. On top of all this, it is impossible to delete my billing info in the account settings so I have no guarantee this won't happen again."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and really helps you build habits. The only gripe I have is that the website requires third party cookies."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love the small habits that create building blocks. Its not overwhelming, but just the right pace to keep you motivated!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very annoying, constant ad notifications that can't be turned off without turning all notifications off."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It does everything that you would hope it would do... maybe even a little bit too well. It'll annoy you with notifications and reminders but, that's what it's there for. That's why you installed the app. To try to improve your life in incremental steps. You'll see how comfortable you are in outright ignoring the app, but - you'll get what you put into it. You're only defeated when you give up completely. Give it a try."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the daily routine Fabulous helped me set up and the daily reminders and check list. I love the suggestions that help me build my wake up and wind down routine. Enjoy the daily inspirational quotes and love the prerecorded daily coaching! Even tho I don't even have to think to drink water every morning/day , I still love checking out off, helps me feel accomplished. Thanks bunches to the Fabulous Team! To move a mountain you must first move pebbles :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"The app helps me stay on track and has helpful short reads to keep you interested. Some of the sounds can beat bit annoying at first."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just amazing ü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love the design and the motivational little things that make it amazing. Good job and thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Startup music is ear-splitting loud. Nearly gave me a panic attack opening it with headphones on. Actually the whole app is incredibly loud."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Predatory price model Downloaded because this was free through play pass. Absolutely awful. Had to sign up for a seven day trial. After days of constant notifications and an endless stream of challenges (send invites through social media) I decided to uninstall. I'm glad i did before the trial ended because I was about to be charged for a yearly subscription of 39.99 on day eight. Thankfully my mental health was good enough to remember to cancel. Can't believe google stands by this trash app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's so great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have high hopes for the end result of this app, but kinda mad that I can't edit a day: I opened the routine yesterday but forgot to actually hit ""play"" to go through the steps, and now it looks like I missed a day and I have to start over at a 1 day streak."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I gave this app ***** (a few weeks ago). I cancelled it today. I have ADHD and what started as a helpful reminder became too much noise. Will reconsider when ADHD mode is researched and implemented. (Will Beta test)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pricing options are dubious from the start. Content-wise, application is fine. Certain sections can't be fast-forwarded / skipped though, so good luck if you've already finished reading the section and just wasting time to wait for the application to decide you may go to the next step, or if you've unintentionally quit that module and wanted to continue from the middle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very pleasantly surprised at how much this is helpful to me. Very well done."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very calming and helpful."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"It was initially good, but I didn't like being forced to eat breakfast. I don't want to eat if I'm not hungry"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really good experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Trully helpful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app I've had wonderful time so far and I'm looking forward to My Future Self"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"love this app it's just different to all the others. Easy to use and navigate, helpful and positive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Downloaded but ""results cannot be autofilled"""
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Was a little wierd and new but really loving the small steps and the encouragement along the way. Interested to see how the next 14 days go! All and all best app for spiritual, mental and physical health easy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Pretty awesome app. I'm telling all my zoom meetings about you guys and girls!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's a great motivator and guide. I've only been using it for a few weeks now but Ive started to make changes to my daily schedule and, In turn, I've noticed myself being more present, more energetic and more focused throughout the day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing ive had the app less than a week and my life has changed for the better and im so proud of myself for sticking to it and being able to hold myself accountable. This app hels you create not only a better, healthy, happy you but also helps build lasting foundations for your new life!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Niceeee"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is going to change my life. It has been so truly encouraging so far."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I HATE this app. I've given it a few weeks try, but the nearly constant nagging to upgrade greatly out weighs any usefulness the app may have. All of the good content is behind a paywall, but you don't *know* it's premium content until you click on it and are met with an ""Upgrade for access!"" screen. If they were a LOT less pushy, offered a 30 day free trial, and a monthly subscription option instead of a $63 yearly one, I might actually give it a try. It's obvious what they are really after."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's was really so great to use thus app it's so wow I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Money grab for sure. Does have a free 1 week trial but then you have to pay upfront for a year. Definitely not making a year long commitment to an app, would have been tempted if it were billed monthly but nope."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Been using it for two days now, it helps me itch that results-oriented part of my brain a lot, thank you! My only problems are I hope we can change our profile pictures, delete our own circle posts, and delete or edit our own circle comments. This will make things a whole lot easier and make the process smoother :3 All that aside, I really love the concept and the art style is very cute. I can tell that a lot of thought went behind this. This app is well-made ‚ô°"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app very much"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I find it tedious. I spend more time trying to read and follow through. Wastes lots of time. 3 glasses of water, really?? I want to cancel now, which button should I press."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Keeps me in order."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was not happy, i couldnt cancel my subscription and i just had $63 taken out of my bank i didnt like the app at all"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is a dream so far, the few days I've had it. I believe in the concept of the making healthy changes slowly so they stick, and so does Fabulous. They have an intellectual, science based approach with an enjoyable presentation. I think I will pick up some great life long habits with this app üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"üíñ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I had an issue with the billing department, a double charge for the subscription. It was taken care of almost immediately. I love using the app, only issue I have is that the habits for the day need a date to ensure you are actually on ""Today"". I think its a time zone issue. ""Today"" doesnt arrive until its several hours in and it can sometimes mess up my morning routine. Consequently if I managed to do everything every morning I wouldnt notice so maybe im the problem here."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Exceptional, guidance and support love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Incredible!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A little confusing on where to find things. And the choices you have in the ""journeys"" But the helpfulness of the app overshadows that confusion. SO GREAT!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Your application is not working It's not responding while entering Gmail Plz take a action"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A stupendous idea and an extremely exalting app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Tries to get your credit card to charge you $40 straight up before even showing you what the app actually does. Smells like a scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for a free trial and then cancelled. Ive now been charged ¬£45. Id like my money back"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Does a wonderful job directing simple tasks to build into something larger. I do wish it was cheaper but I suppose that is the way things are done these days."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the story adventures üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription but was charged anyway a week later."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Small habits are key. I like the app so far, I've been in it for a week."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So angry this app took the last of my money and decided to pay for a year subscription I didn't ask for and now I can't get my money back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is difficult to use, it's not helpful, it is way to hard to cancel membership"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and does help keep you on track with creating habits that will last and that matter. Also love the coaching."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"The app is good and all but the pictures that they gave on the top doesn't match with the app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps Ever for making habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Its stuck on loading ""we are personalizing your journey"".. it still loading even after one day.. any solution ???? Andriod 12.."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. A but pricy after the trail run bt beautiful nontheless... Easy to use"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing app ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I left a review explaining my experience with the app. You can't even demo it without a credit card on file. I got a notification that the developer responded, and clicking the notification showed nothing. No record of leaving a review... Looks like the company falsely flags reviews for removal. Here's another 1 star based on my experience with the application and the company."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"If it would let me rate it 0 I would. I don't remember subscribing but I just found a charge on my account and didn't even have the app download any longer but I was charged almost $40 I had to hunt on my Google to even find it. Terrible!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I like the app very well, it is nice and very welcoming. However the problem I have is that I want to pay part of google play. I don't really trust putting my credit card information to make purchases. I usually buy Google play cards to put in my phone to make app purchases. Other then that the app is nice."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very nice app very necessary for helping people"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"A good app that does what it says I feel its very guiding and helpful to building my daily habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very good app helps you gain discipline day by day"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"simply exquisite."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever. Tried to charge my debit card, luckily my bank declined. Now I'm trying to make sure I'm not subscribed and the app keeps freezing."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app makes my touch screen stop working. Went into Verizon and they couldn't fix it either even gave me a new phone and it still does the same thing on this phone. Reached out to the company about a refund and they responded at first but it's a month now and I've reached out to them several times and provided video proof of the app disabling my touch screen and they are just ignoring me. Very unprofessional. If they get back to me I'll update my review but right now they basically scammed me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Charged $40 still after cancelling"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"beautiful app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome app feel renew to life thank you fabulous"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I Lovethis appü§©"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I wanted to really enjoy this app but the trial period is short and spendy that it's hard to truly get a feel for the app. Great concept."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So easy to use. Gives you energy. And if you enjoy taking challenges, then this app is completely for you."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App doesn't work. They won't help or give money back. There's no customer service. Noone to call. The online contact us page/form,I filled it out, days later I recieved an email saying they would review. I wrote right back giving very light remarks how fabulous was becoming frustrating... well over a week later I Finally get an email that says sorry we reviewed and because you didn't cancel our free trial We can't refund your money.. AGAIN That's not the problem the app isn't working!! SCAM!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"So. Many. Notifications. Became more stressful than helpful. Got swindled into premium but the extra features aren't worth it and can't get a refund. The nightly coaching quotes were actually nice until they started repeating. Very disappointed in this app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely a great motivation app. Love it üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Sometimes the notifications are surprising and scare me"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is great but its a four star becauce i dont like the health car√® apps that have premium or sumthing butt its still great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love my Fabulous app. Especially now its easier to get technical support from the very friendly team. Fabulous is like a companion üå∏üôèüëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is truly impressive, thank youüòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I actually love this app and the way you are encouraged vs feeling obligated to complete a task or goal YOU set for YOURSELF. No matter how small, you really feel accomplished and motivated to move forward with whatever you set. It is helpful for those that want to build the mindset of good habits, while celebrating every milestone. Try it for yourself and see ( premium is free for 30 days!)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hands down favorite app right now. Keeps me on track and motivates me. Highly recommended for sure"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"So far, I'm really enjoying the app. The goals and challenges are extremely doable and helps you build habits a step at a time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I activated it just for a month and just used it for three days and found out it is useless. It was a promotion but they charged me at the end of the promotion for an annual premium subscription. I contacted them and explained I didn't use the app but they said I won't be refunded!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Habit building and life coaching made easy and automated. Cool!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Terrible login process. And if you think you might switch phones sometime, forget trying to login on a new phone or different device. Their help section says they will re-charge you to login to your premium account, you have already paid for, if it is on a new device. Plus, it also takes about 5 min to reach the abilty to click several menus to get to a login option. No other app forces re-payment to login to an account that is already paid for. That is truly terrible software programming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I am not able to sign up like it's not moving forward after giving the email, kindly see to it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice artwork keeps me motivated to keep going with my morning routine, and there were a bunch of options to choose from in terms of what you wanna put in there! Likely by design, but I wish the timer for exercise didn't start automatically every time I close the notes for it haha"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great inspiration"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend this app if you're trying to heal from trauma and learn self care/mediation."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great at forming good and healthy habits and routines!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good so far! Very good if you have ADHD"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why not provide charging information up front, instead of having to spend time and provide information?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Thoroughly enjoying it so far. Practical and encouraging üòÄ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app. Would like to have more options for what habits I can put into my list. For example I would like to add brushing teeth to my morning routine not because I need to build that habit but because that way I can connect my new habits to exsiting ones."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Really loving it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It is nice to have an app that looks like caring about you until... bam! Go premium options everywhere i tap. I mean at least you guys could've give a trial for a whole month. Not everyone's currency are dollars or euros, it is pretty expensive. I was enjoying this app until premium options. It is sad that i'll uninstall this app, but appreciate the effort."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this for a week and I absolutely love it! It has helped me out so much!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I am enjoying this app. Very positive and motivating! Little changes help to create bigger changes for a better me. This app is great! I really enjoy it very much."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Immediately uninstalled. Why make a loud and annoying sound when opening the app?"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Gives the motivation that I need"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Didn't even let me get past email sign up. I think it needs to work out some glitches."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is great, helps you overcome personal limitations one small step at a time and doesn't overwhelme you by asking too much of you, and it's so easy to use, I love the notes before starting a new challenge and little well done after I complete a habit, it's such a nice feeling and motivator to continue. Overall feel like my days are getting better :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"the free version lacks some things but it is an overall good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great customer service!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed, one month ago I tried to get the 30 day free trial and, u guys rejected my card details. Then after one month, I didn't even use the premium I'm been changed. Please remove my details from this account."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"You guys are horrrrible. FRAUDULENT. I canceled appropriately before my trial expired & you guys even canceled me! I don't even HAVE A PREMIUM ACCOUNT. But you charged me $35 via PayPal. For what!? Per YOU, I need to upgrade to a premium account. I've tried every single link, website, email, tech help, to no avail if they'll even work. PayPal is trying to get me my money back & obviously you're also giving them the run-around b/c it's taking the full allowable time. Insanity!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's been helping me every day with were I want to go."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"No Chance to reach their support.They cancel my lifetime account.Never replying my emails."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscribition and they still charged me and now I can't even cancel my subscription and I can't remove my card this is so illegal"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for 7 day trial , and after 2 days of using I found it's useless. And now I can't even cancel my subscription. It's sending me to the web but there saying I don't have any however after 7 days of trial I will have to pay for the full year. Such a scam"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great app so far for building a healthy habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"best app l love it best way to make your life productive,effective and aesthetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Scam! I signed up to this app through the 30 day free trial, but after a few days didn't really enjoy the app and CANCELED through the play store. I stopped receiving emails and the subscription wasn't active in my play store. I thought that was it, until I saw today that I was charged the annual subscription fee that I really didn't want to pay because I couldn't afford it. Many people have this problem, scammers!!! Not acceptable at all. I sent an email to support, let's see what happens."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for membership even though I canceled before the trial. I had to claim fraud with my bank, and have to update a new debit card for everything! On top of that, I finally got my account back together and was charged AGAIN!! I had to pay for a permanent stop payment. Meanwhile, it's not even on my list of subscriptions in the Play Store. NOPE."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with this app, it's simply amazing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not worth it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This has literally helped me in every way I'm thankful for this type of structure and being held accountable üíñüôå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really love this app, i only discover it months ago and it has been the greatest habit creator in my life. The tips that they give you is motivating. Improvement Pill (YouTube creator) sponsored it and i guess i should give it a try. Love the app so much üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing after i finish setting it up and do the last step of fingerprint"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I would like a refund of my subscription since I don't find it useful at all..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was feeling kinda lost lately, I think this app is a great way to start a new journey, new year new resolution.ü§óüòâ"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love love love"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's nice to read their beautiful stories and experiences of other people and studies. Awesome that they remind you of your habits through notifications, really nice app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"App collects your personal info thru a pandering questionnaire then immediately uses that information to ask for money. There is no ""free trial"" and you need to pay at least $1 before you can progress in any way. Not very helpful, in fact I feel worse now as my email has a new influx of spam from the Fabulous Science Team asking for a monthly subscription fee."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Developer here. This is one of the best, most useful and most beautiful apps I've ever used. Is very well programmed and set up. Congratulations and please keep up the good work!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Cancelled before the 7 day trial expired (which you have to do online, not in the app). I was still charged after 7 days (after receiving two emails that my subscription was cancelled and expired) and their online form for getting a refund says it can't provide a refund for me. Tried contacting the company and the automated response had links to the online form and cancelling subscription FAQ. If I don't hear from a representative, I'll be contacting my credit card company for a chargeback."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged the full price and I canceled immediately. I canceled on February 16, 2022 and I have yet to receive my refund. I have been in contact with their support staff and now no one wants to answer my emails. Where is my refund?! Your company took my money and now I want it back."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good for creating healthy routeins and breaking habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unique jingle makes it easier for me to actually open the thing instead of ignoring it. Lots of polish on the ui make it pretty satisfying to use compared to similar apps."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app! Only been using it for a few weeks but it really has helped me start healthy habits such as praying daily, practising gratitude and more I love when I complete a challenge to my plan makes me feel really accomplished even though I realise I do so much in the day but never see the benefits but with this app it does because I have something to go by to show me my progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Could you please put this in Huawei's app gallery."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good! For me, having something to look forward to and achieve has been working for me. The coaching letters each day make you feel inspired to reach those small goals. $40/year to better myself and work to become the person i want to be is well worth it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It is making my day productive so far!! I'm glad that i found this in Instagram ads. Not giving 5 star because more fabulous options are for premium..i hope that was free but anyways!!A Download is worth it!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing of you follow it I had it for a while and did not bother with it to much but since I been doing to the letter its really is changing my life one small step at a time I would recommend this app to anyone struggling with life organisation ect"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"i love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Nice üëç it's nice to be able to have company"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Increased rating after retrying recently. I realize what a powerful idea & implementation this is... ju but still, not quite fully effective. Also, dislike that they mix the free and paid parts that it's hard to tell what's free and what not."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. It gives cute reminders and helps me feel good about myself too."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Thanks for being present."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This very helpful app for me to take care and love myself ‚ù§"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app for making new habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far this app is definitely helping me with my ADHD. Makes me happy and helps me calm down and helps me remember things to keep myself healthy"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It is helping me. Just begun."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"genius! gamification of mental health improvement, without the toll of perfectionism, without the need/urge to beat the game: creative/colourful and relaxing short stories are the reward for just using the app, which makes you gain control and improvement of your life in small steps. thx for holding my hand and showing me how to master the creation of habits effortlessly."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"They are improving many aspects of the app. But bottom line, YOU have to follow through."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Can't sign in to cancel"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAPP. it's impossible to withdraw from the subscription and the support team can't help. I wasn't able to unsubscribe even if I wanted to and tried hard to. the application still charged me and I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to unsubscribe at least now or ever...."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It deserves a try. So far, there's no reason for complains üòä"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's amazing and free. It helped me so much and I feel so much happier now. I recoend this app <3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Truly inspiring app, love the advices and checklists to improve habits"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very interesting, I'm not sure of the results just yet."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome! The power of small steps!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the one-week free introduction of Fabulous."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Es una estafa. La aplicaci√≥n tiene opci√≥n gratuita pero nunca la muestra. Use la prueba gratis por un d√≠a, al d√≠a siguiente de inmediato cancele la prueba y desinstale la aplicaci√≥n. Hoy unasemana despu√©s me est√°n cobrando la anualidad de $162,200 COP No hay soporte..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the motivation this gives me to succeed"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"There's certainly a lot of content in this app, but it looks nothing like the sample images here, I found the journeys confusing, the notifications were relentless, and as someone with ADHD it not only didn't help me get organized, it made me feel less organized."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"If you've ever heard the term 'trust the process', it was meant for this."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Pretty useless I was hoping to get something to establish good habit and maybe get rid of some but it's faboulus way or no way. I tried skipping the water thingy but all I've received for the past 2 weeks now is spam about drinking water in the morning which I was doing prior to installing this. I went with it for a few days then realized now that I'm just ignoring all the reminder because it's always totally irrelevant and useless. Too bad so many people give positive feedback before trying."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The app is very well designed and the trial shows you a very clean UI without distracting ads. I like that it doesn't encourage you to make drastic changes all at once. Cons: 1: I dont see a clear way to block/mute someone on a circle. Some posts may be harmful to your way of thinking but there is only a ""feedback on post"" and not a quietly block and move on. 2: sharing links to circles requires copy/pasting link. Lack of easy entry discourages joining and building unique groups"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I've enjoyed my journey and want to keep goin!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. It sets reminders for me to drink water and write in my journal, which has helped me so much. I highly recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Awesome üòé"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Greatful And thankful for this App"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Infuriating - I believed I had cancelled because Fabulous were spamming me about re-joining, then I just saw that they'd charged me again. Total waste of money - the app is hard to use, patronising and ineffective"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's hard for me to use and not like the advertising pictures show. I can't create a daily routine and Its very complex to understand"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far so good, but I have a tabled, the app is locked to portrait mode and it bothers me. Everything else is good."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible don't download unless you want to pay 39.99"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Best app I ever tried so far!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"These app is so good for health there is no ads I like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I have tried many habbit changing apps but this one is special. I dont know butbsomething about this app motivates me to stick to my discipline. They dont force habbit transformation but guide and create environment to follow the journey amd ot the destination. Small small tricks and tips keeps you motivated to do more. I will definitely recommend this app to my friends and family whonare looking to transform thier life by changing thier habbits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty useful"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Bumping up my rating for the customer support! The app was cute but not very easy to use, so I cancelled my free trial. I was still charged for the annual premium fee several days later, but customer support were responsive and helpful, and resolved the issue for me with no fuss. Thank you!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fab"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I recently converted from a Samsung to IPhone, and I'm unable to transfer my progress. I've contacted fabulous numerous times but no response. I did contact Customer Service (CS) through the app and got an automated system. I've tried all suggestions and none worked. I tried getting a refund to then repurchase through my iPhone but the automated response denied my refund. I am extremely furious that there is no way to get someone in CS. The app was great but the experience with CS is horrible."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"Not very transparent... You can't progress on a journey until you do the required days of whatever goal you're on. BUT the journey will turn off without telling you! So I did the required 14 days of meditation in order to move forward but my journey was off the entire time! I turned it back on but it didn't count my 14 days. So now I have to wait 2 more weeks before I can progress?? Makes me want to give up on it tbh"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Great at setting goals for a healthier lifestyle. I have a free premium account right now so I hope it's still as good when that runs out."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Fabulous but difficult to use."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Could not unsubsribe no matter how hard I tried. Not user friendly at all in that regard. Would not recommend."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app is constantly asking me to rate it and is sending me notifications to do so, i paid for it but i think i will stop using it if it'll continue at this rate"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The design is amazing. And I love the reminders. Update: they totally changed it :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it is easy to use, intuitive, inspirational and seamlessly guides you through the process. I highly recommend this app if you want to embark on a journey of self discovery, personal development and becoming better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is one of the most helpful apps I've ever used. Makes it easier to organize and better my life"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience. Out 55 dollars that I couldn't afford because they purposefully make it so difficult to figure out how to cancel before your trial expires, and absolutely zero customer service. The only ""help"" you get is from submitting a complaint through their website, and you will receive an automated e-mail presumably from a bot that tries to find keywords in your complaint to guess what you meant? I have been trying for three days to speak to an actual human with no progress."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I have only been doing this for a week. But I like it so far. And I like the concept of making small changes at a time. It is realistic and calming."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is really helping me look at my life and making the most of it cxx"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This helps me so much! And there are so manyy fun stories!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"On day 3, So far so good ;)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love the app helped me alot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Just started a few days ago. Fabulous has just the right level of interesting nudges & reminders that I have been looking for! Every other app like this I have tried before has either been so gentle that I forget about using it, or so motivational that I feel like I'm in training for some competition. I'm glad those are out there for people searching for the interactivity that works for them. For me, this couldn't have come at a better time. I learned abot it from the ad on ""How to ADHD"". üòÉ‚ù§üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel prior to the free period ending. Edit: I was able to cancel. What tripped me up initially was attempting to cancel through the web interface (not app) while using my android device. This was a impossible. Once I accessed the account on my laptop, I was able to cancel. I left because I already drink water first thing in the morning, and the suggestion seemed silly given the level of selfcare I already do. I would be open to something more tailored to my existing habits."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"The best app everrr I love itttt ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really does motivate me , as an artist , I appreciate color and dude this app is so cute ! But that's not it the noises and everything just touch your comfort zone , I love it! I considered this app because I know I need to make a change in my life , and so far I'm at a good pace ‚ù§ Update, my life went downhill alot. Idk how but at some point I deleted this cute little app and forgot about it but now I've refund it and giving building better habits another try. Wish me luckü§û"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful graphics, great information"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The app generates way too many notifications. While I like the general idea of what it tries to accomplish, it is far too intrusive and it defeats the purpose. After a few days I was already overwhelmed by the notifications and defaulted to simply ignoring them. Too make matters worse, selecting a notification usually resulted in the app starting a recording that wasn't always easy to stop (which really sucks if you are at work and you accidentally open a notification instead of discarding it)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This app has and still is one of the biggest contributing factors to my life changing experience in finding deep contentment within my entire being‚ù§!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing üíú"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"App is meh, a little too railroad-y for me, and cancelling wasn't as easy as it should be (not documented in Google Play app as a subscription), but they did refund me when contacted."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I canceled my account and was charged anyways. There is no way to contact anyone for them to refund my money."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the app‚ù§Ô∏èüíï"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I can't find the FAQ or any contact info such as an email or phone number. HELP"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very positive. No shaming!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I don't know what kind of business you're running but you're charging me 42.99 (!) and I've never used the app. Please contact me and explain me how I can avoid paying this insane amount that I have not approved"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Avoid! Charged me ¬£34.99 after I unsubscribed during the free trial period and still can't communicate to get a refund. Uncontactable!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Truely motivational"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Unobtrusive reminders, sleek design. I really enjoy using this app! Edit: I'm back in the app in 2022. This is still true, and I HIGHLY recommend it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Let people know before they do anything on the app that you have to pay for it & it wont get so many downloads."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I love it it helps me with my days make me feel like I matter and gives me motivation!!! Definitely a great app DOWNLOAD IT it's worth it"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So inspirational!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"It's basically your mother nagging you all the time. I want my $40 back. Forums were not helpful for support as no one participates. Confusing different areas - habits, challenges, etc. One didn't seem to connect to the other. Daily inspirations read by hippies are annoying, can't just read them myself. Noom was better."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I was ambivalent, but after two weeks ot has helped and I will be using it every day."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It has been amazing so far!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Ive started my journey a couple of times now. I always feel supported and it makes it easier to work around things with the kind words and tips the app provides. I really like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I can't log in"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was double charged and the refund form is not allowing me to submit my request since the upload file feature is not working. Contact me immediately and provide full refund!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very pleasant aesthetics and sounds, which helps my brain feel good about the small steps I'm taking :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Stop with the unskippable animations"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"I found the app overwhelming with so much push for the premium membership, like over the top. I'm still getting emails about it after i tried the free trial and uninstalled the app because of it. I wish they would just let you try the free app without all the in your face upgrade to premium."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Like others, It was EXTREMELY difficult to find a way to actually cancel this membership before they billed me after the free trial. You can't cancel on your phones web browser you have to log into the website on an actual computer and cancel....it's the only way. Just glad I figured it out before I got scammed."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Pretty interesting, just started using it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Goo motivational app if you're ready to start yourself on a new journey."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I love the design. The app is great."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lovely experience so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The graphics are beautiful, but that's the only thing that I liked about this app. It's confusing and not intuitive. I would get push notifications but they wouldn't actually take me to the related section of the app. Tasks would show up and then disappear before I could complete them. There was often no explanations of tasks so I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. I tried to reach out to support but they made it clear from their replies that they hadn't even read my message."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"My experience has been great"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Why you guys make it so hard to cancel a membership."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Helps a lot"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I like this app, but when I tried to upgrade to premium, it charged me a little amount the moment I hitted: try ""For Free"" one week and cancel any time... Where was that info before upgrading? Now I'm not sure about paying the whole year :("
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Wonderful for goal setting and improving self esteem and overall outlook."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"This is a very idiotic app doesn't even let me sign in completely after writing my email address it won't let me click the continue button anymore."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent program üëç"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Yup, shoooooo"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"just doenload this app cuz its so good<3"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I was charged for renewal a day early! I was planning to cancel my subscription before it expired tomorrow, and I find I've already been charged for another year. And I've been told no refund will be issued - this is completely unacceptable! Automatic renewal while the previous subscription is still valid - how is that anything but a money-grabbing tactic? Please prove me wrong. I expect to be contacted in order to put this right, and I sincerely hope Fabulous lives up to its name."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It really has helped me time manage and be q lot more productive"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I signed up for 1week trial. Do not suceed to cancel it. Tried all suggestions oferred. They are useless. Do not take the trial. Maybe It's a trick Ihope someone can help out"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Beautiful journey with fabulous. Narrator guides us on path of forming new habits, in funny and easy ways!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I'm now having trouble using the app. I've installed it on both my phone and my computer. This search is confirming that I've found it and installed it, but I can't make it work. So, I absolutely love it, but now it won't work. Works great on my phone!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Extremely complicated to cancel. Can't find my subscription, there's no point making so difficult other that want to keep charging you. I don't want ""more useless instructions"" I want to cancel. Period!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Such a great app super motivating can help you stick to your routine very encouraging has some of the best ""every morning and it helps you push to your goals everyday such a blessing love this app"

"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good at building a routine. Wish it was more pushy with me though."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I've been trying to unsubscribe and still can't get there. I cancelled in Google play and it's trying to charge me. I tried in app it tells me to go web. This should be more straightforward"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Please add Google pay"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"Seems good but can't benefit as it needs credit/debit details for free stuff."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Liking it so far. Still learning it."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"It's a FABULOUS app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good so far"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"They are refusing to end my sub"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it so far. Its early days but it is helping. I'll come back in a month and update"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"So far I like it because it is simple and helpful. I will share and write if I can find improvements."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"The application wasn't what I was looking for, I have cancelled the subscription and they keep trying to charge me, when reached the customer service, they said I have 2 times a subscription (?) How this can be possible when you have only one email address and one application in your phone?... I'm still awaiting for their reply."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is very good but i want delete my account how i delete it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It's so user friendly and encouraging."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It's like having your own personal coach!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Cool app! Helped me set and follow simple goals I was procrastinating for so long"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I will give it all 5 star! I really loved almost everything about it :) It's my second day and I am feeling great! Thanks to Fabulous!! Just if there would be more updates it would be really good :)"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastically fabulous!!!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've used. It's well-rounded, complex and helps you have a better outlook on your life and your future."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app from google play and wanted to use trial. I tried to subscribe to be able to use trial version but after that the app kept asking me to switch to premium so i thought i was not subscrubed and then i checked from google play for subscription and made sure that i was not subscribed. Then few minutes ago i got charged from the app that i absolutely did not like. Apparently i was subscribed through your website. I did not even know that this was possible. I request refund."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to build new healthier habits, it's full of extraordinary information and done to a very high standard! I thoroughly recommend it!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Hi i love this app because l feel happy to speak with someone i love it thank you very much for this super magic app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"I love this app because of how easy it is. The only thing I would recommend is to have more challenges going on at the same time."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is the best App I have found so far for managing executive dysfunction. It's helped me get my routines on track and even take initiative to do chores that a month ago felt like too much to handle. It works perfectly with how my brain processes and the small increments are very manageable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Huge scam. Canceled my subscription but it auto renewed afterwards. No refund. Total b/s company. Would not recommend these guys are thieves!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Little content of any value, difficult to use, hard to see any benefit in it. Ridiculously difficult to cancel the subscription."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"What happened to the journeys at the bottom of the main page? I liked seeing what was coming and how far I am in the journey. Is it only a premium/first week thing? Or was it a recent change overall? Something I would like to see is an 18+ option. I see many kids posting pics of themselves, while it's great that they want to better themselves, it's a good way to get someone in trouble for interacting with someone who isnt of age, purposefully or not. Not to mention can be not safe for the kids."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Definitely useful although wish you could pay monthly rather than annually"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Great idea and goid motivation. Sometimes it's a bit confusing to navigate."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",2,"So far for looks, it's a get fit for me I love the art and features I like cute stylistic apps because it give me something to attach to visually and emotionally. The set up is easy to follow and takes you by the hand and guides through tasks. which is also favorable since I struggle to organize my tasks on my own and easily get overwhelmed because of my mental illness. As for the payment issue I am hesitant to commit to this app. Financial hardships are common so the billing needs work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Total scam. Tried free trial on Google play. Tried to cancel before trial period ended and there was no subscription showing on google. Could not cancel on website either. All of a sudden they can find your account when they want your Forty dollars. Zero stars üåü"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"It helps to create a rutine and be motivated!! I really like this aaplication!!"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it‚Äôs just amazing and motivating..."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"English version is better than Spanish version."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"This app is overall really great with a lot of options, but the only thing i would like to change on this app is the possibility for adjusting notificafions easily. I want my routines and that's it, nothing else. No coaching or stories or... I do not have the time for them and i don't want to spend it on them"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I have tried this app and since it didn't suit me well, I've cancelled free-trial subscription after 3-4 days of using. Today I got an email that my subscription has been expired (as it should be), BUT I see on my bank account I was charged for 39.99 USD today. What the hell!? And also, it's so uncomfortable, because there's no option to unsubscribe from an app, that's why I needed to find website and do it this way.... And seems it didn't work."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Lifesaver."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Premium is absolutely worth it! I downloaded the regular version and within 2 days I decided I'm going with premium. As a medical dumpsterfire this app is helping me with ALOT of things."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"This is not as same as the picture"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Super simple uplifting tool to help establish new habits for a healthier, happier, more satisfying life. The free version alone is beneficial, the paid version is a very manageable cost billed annually that really can help reinforce establishing new habits through this encouraging app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Nice experience even with the free version"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"good stuff"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"A little confusing"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Need to enter payment info for free week. Not enough ability to see what this can offer for free."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"I did not like it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Great app for self development"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Honestly, it's in the name. I really enjoy the positive encouragement and focus."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",4,"Very likeable."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"It is of average ease to use. However the notifications are programmed as alarms, not notifications, so bypass my phone do not disturb settings. It was disruptive during the day and disturbing my sleep at night, becoming so tired, so I turned off most of the functions. A counterproductive app."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, it's one of THE BEST apps I have been using lately. Thanks to the developer and the whole team. BIG HUG to them ü§óü§ó"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"it's a nice app but much more expensive than I thought when conveted to south African rands"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",3,"I was so excited to try this app until I realized it's all locked behind paying a premium subscription. It seems like a nice app. I wish you could personalize things like mental health, meds and therapy. It's a huge factor in daily wellness, which this app is trying to promote."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Love this app. More than just a to-do list, it truly helps me get to a better place in my life. I have mental illness that often finds me struggling to just get out of bed, let alone accomplish anything. I restart my Fabulous journey each time and go back to just a glass of water in the morning. Eventually I build back up to my daily to-do list. This method has kept me with the app for two years now, knowing I can always start small when that's all I can handle."
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Fabulous Daily Routine Planner","Unknown",5,"Amazing new adventure . I love it"
