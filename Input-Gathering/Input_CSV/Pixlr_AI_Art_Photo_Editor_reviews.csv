"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Error - sorry something went wrong , couldn't remove background , the online pixlr works thou ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App only works every 1 in 10 goes..mostly stuck on open screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled a bunch of times but just won't work?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Total trash now. Deleting it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Backbone of my pic editing but the recent changes to the collage editing has rendered it useless. This breaks my heart. Virtually all the updates in collage have made every function more difficult for me as a 15 year plus user and promoter of your incredible app. Pleased rethink the ability to swap out images back to the simple 'press and drag' and I'll go back to 5 stars. Thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best wishes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This has always been a good app. My husband & I have been using & enjoying it for years. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the extra cost of having to buy stickers, frames, overlays, fonts, some of which used to be free & the cost of using some of the new AI features. The app also has put in new adds, most of the time they're not intrusive, but if they have to have these adds, then why can't ALL of the apps features be free?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and despite having my info leaked when they were hacked I still use it, but now it is unusable on a Samsung Z Fold. This is the first review I have ever written for any app simply because the interface is terrible and the buttons are smushed on top of each other and it is virtually impossible to use now from whatever update made it terrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"can't open the app after your latest update. I've used it for years and never had a problem but it pops up and says it had to close because of an error and to try updating after dev fixes error."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice work nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Well I'm off and on with my subscription, but even when it's out Pixlr is the best... I do all my work on it, in the times when I can afford all my subscriptions I get even more to play with... Thank you very much.D.K"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Most useful app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this is the best app I've used"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"For years this was my preferred application for photography editing, once I bought the Pro version but after a while it became public for everyone which was a good thing , why I suggested it every one. When very short and understanble advertisings started showing After saving my work I find it acceptable, But for a few days because of looooong video ads before even saving, I keep forgetting whether I saved or not, two times it crashed just after the ads and lost my efforts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for years just keeps getting better. I couldn't ask for a better tool for my photos. happy would be an understatement."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be great powerful app, now with obnoxious Ads and a push for AI paid subscriptions."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but it's now been decimated by ads and subscription. Absolutely gutted to have to uninstall it but unless you're wanting to pay a lot yearly, this is absolutely unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads have become invasive unlike how they previously were, along with their subscription service of $10 USD Monthly which is now constantly shown on app startup. If you can handle that, it's okay. If you can't, I highly recommend you don't use this app, as it will likely continue down the path it has of aggressive and consumer unfriendly advertising."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Took off one star. I love the app, but why is it no longer showing up among the editing app selections when I open a photo? Now I have to leave the photo, open the Pixlr app, then navigate to the photo. Phone: OnePlus 12 running Android 15"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this since as long as I can remember-from high school days to college days- and I'm married now and still using it. I keep coming back to this editor for its ease to use and the filters it gives is just absolutely beautiful. Love the app. Huge shoutout to the developers."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New UI is horrible, clunky • Vid Ads freeze App before it saves, losing project! • Overlay adds a black border to the top image, ruining the overlay • Been usng for years. Used to love it • If working on a white picture, the options across the top blend in. Can't see them. • Ads to buy pops up just as you click to open a project • There's no undo when drawing, you have to carefully erase or completely start over. • Overlay resizes the picture so it's hard to resize & lineup if using same pic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good application 👍"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"what did you do? I can't even use it now. I've used this app for more than 10 years. I like the idea but the layout is just jacked. just a pile of icon at the bottom of the page. can't really click on, if even know what you're clicking on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. I've used this for probably twenty years, they keep up, and they get better. -Astroforestman"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too bad the update made the app trash. You can't do what you easily used to be able to do. I guess I will have to find some other app to use. I have had this for over 10 years, and now it is junk. Can you just put it back to like it was before?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am making a new review. I am even more upset about the direction this app is going. I have used Pixlr as my go to editing app for many years. New is supposed to mean better, but nothing is better about what this app does now. The creators and developers have ruined it trying to keep up with AI apps even though there are already thousands of Android AI apps. I hoped they'd try and stay original, but I was failed as a user. I hope I can find a old version APK somewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice 👍 I love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love this app and I've had it for years but the AI stuff and chat bubbles and cool things never work."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"10 yrs ago, this was a TOP photo editing/manipulation app. Times, they are a changin' - quickly! Pixlr has not. :( [-]The newer 'ai' tool is rather lacking. [+] Multi-pic 'layer' blending function is still quality, but.. [-] each 'layer' is locked in once added & can't be edited or rearranged. 《**Devs**》 >> STiLL NO 'Undo' FUNCTION within using each TOOL?!? (Please???!) -Also- thank you for the 10+ years of your awesome MANUAL editing app! I've used it more than any other, by far!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for years and loved it. Then, I decided to bite the bullet after the ads got OUT OF CONTROL! After subscribing for one month, they raised the price to 10 a month. It's not that worth it. The last few times I used it, the AI wasn't even working. Very disappointed 😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this daily. It is an essential app in my meme making. The app is versatile and has some great fonts.. I love it!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"THE BEST APP NO APP CAN WORK LIKE PIXLR SIMPLY THE BEST"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used this app for years (probably 6 or 7 years total, 1000+ edits) - this was by far the best free photo editor. They revamped and added all this AI slop and increased frequency of advertisements. Un-installed today, will never use this product again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super cool, robust tools and easy to use. A combo that's a winner for sure"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Background removal not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but it's now a deceptive ad infected garbage app that tricks you into tapping on ads to dismiss them. The app is now as useless as the web app. Bravo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i thing is good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for yeeearrrrsss and never ever did I have a problem. Now, I no longer can replace photos to create as before. The app keeps crashing on me!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"free tools are enough for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I Love This Application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GREAT!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Back to not being able to open the app unless I am in reception so they can greet me with a full page ad. I wish I lived where there's reception. I really do, but I don't. And I cannot use this app because it will not open. I wouldn't be so frustrated with pixar over the years if it wasn't such a reasonably good editing app. But it WAS a better app for a decade. Now, every change is for the worse, and to introduce more ads. I am willing to fight the makers in real life."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I been using this since 2018, I like it. But I have to Uninstaller reinstall so many times JUST SO IT SAVES MY PHOTOS. I wish they would fix that, because I love this app, but the ads, and the having to reinstall just for it to save photos again it's getting ridiculous"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love Pixlr, and have been using it for many years, on every phone I've had! 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You want me to pay for this app now after having this app for a very long time forcing me to do a free trial then charging after that thx but no thx.... good way to lose ppl......bye bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Never asked for all the AI nonsense to be shoved in and be constantly pushed on me when I just need to crop an image..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"For quite a few years I've used this app and I found it quick and very reliable to make creative content. Over the last few months though, everything has changed. It's no longer quick, and no longer 100% reliable. It's buggy, it sometimes closes half way through a creative project, which is incredibly frustrating. Things seen to take twice as long now. If it was still reliable, I'd be inclined to purchase, but it's not. I'll still use it because I'm so used to it, but my patience wears thin!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"easy to use and makes photo editing fun!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"💯💯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go-to app for quick photo editing, but the changes they have made to the app have made it nearly unusable. Ads the moment you try to export an image. Ai prompts literally everywhere that are unavoidable. Them trying to get you to subscribe to their payment plan. I am very upset and disappointed in what the app has become."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very useful, fairly simple to learn, been using it for years."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"2-4-25 This WAS one of my favorite go to photo apps. Ads have become invasive, locking up the screen and opening additional separate unwanted windows that don't allow normal exiting, acts like malware. Please reconfigure ad presentations to keep users. Sadly, I'm having to search for another app to post process photos at this point."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years, but today the Double Exposure seem not to be working. Pls check & fix. When done, will revert to 5 star rating. 🙏🏻 Update: now properly working. Tnx!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible. No response from support ever! Signed out after every session & as I signed up using email. Always reverts to signing in with my mobile. Lost credit & no support. Unless. It did work until December 2024."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I cant login"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"sucks you have to pay to access a lot of the content now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is usually amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"great image editor!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"to many ads now of lately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The latest update is awful. I used to rely on Pixlr to make quick and easy collages. The new interface is so annoying and painful to use. You can no longer easily switch your images around by dragging them and it was very onerous. The UI is also unintuitive with the stupid check mark in the bottom corner."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app pixel is my favorite one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome photo editor as always👍🏽"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be the go to app for quick edit and collage. Ruined by too intrusive uninterruptable ads. Will uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome App, but the AI generator does seem to work for Android🤔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like it you can do all kinds of pic's on it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great for quick, simple picture editing. I've been using it for years at this point but today I'm finally giving up on it. With the second addition of ""AI"" features that are pushed when opening the app AND when selecting images to edit on top of the ""premium"" services being released alongside increasing intrusive advertisement that keep getting longer and opening the play store multiple times trying to exit the layers of ads, this app simply isn't usable for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be a great image editing app. Now like so many others, it's been infected with unethical regurgitative AI. At least you still have the options you did before, but it's also become more annoying to use due to it begging you to turn on notifications and subscribe to premium every time you open the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"AP WAS AMAZING been using for years to make collage and now it's pretty much unusable. You could re arrange it everything now no and have different ways to have the collage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"too many ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great app! I've used it for nearly a decade. However, I hate how the ads work now, so I'm kicking off two stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Bakwaas"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Latest updates are genuinely terrible. They attempted to ""simplify"" things and wound up making half of what I used the app for significantly clunkier and less functional. No longer having numbers on aspect ratios so you can see exactly what your free adjustments are, the massively clunky hold to move on the collage (that takes forever to trigger when you want it and accidentally triggers when you don't). I gave it a bit to see if I could get used to it, but it's such a major downgrade."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"cool!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The AI stuff is intrusive and gets in the way of all of the actual good features. The ads are terrible and SO long. It takes 30 seconds just to go from ""I would like to save this picture"" to actually saving the picture. And if you wanted to make a minor edit, WHOOPS, that's another 30 second ad break for a shoddy Temu product!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's ok for what it is. Expensive for the AI credits, especially since it doesn't work a portion of the time. I like it when it functions properly. Remove background function doesn't work no matter how hard I try. It'd be nice to get it fixed considering how much I pay for this subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am so frustrated with this new update. I've been using Pixlr since 2015!!! It's always been my go to photo editor and collage maker. I've stuck with it even with more and more ads coming up. But this latest update has made the collage feature completely unusable!!! Why on earth would they take away the ability to easily move your photos around in the grid?! It makes no sense!!! Supposedly you can press and hold with 2 fingers and then move the photo, but that has not worked for me. So angry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I USED to love this free version of the PIXLR photo app. I'd use it almost daily & while doin so, sometimes I'd check out 1 of the ""UN-obtrusive ad's"" that seemed interesting. HOWEVER, whatever they've done to it as of JAN2025 has turned a wonderful/useful free apps into THE MOST ANNOYING & OBNOXIOUS bombardment of advertisements for THE MOST HORRIBLE & UNWANTED pay 2 play apps out there. Honestly this is a disgrace to whomever built PIXLR initially. I'm so sorry for you loss. ...dump this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sadly ruined due to intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it a lot to design my patterns with. Special shoutout to the frames, but the stickers could be better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"the best Ads constantly..to buy things..perfect leading to spend money..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Okay for general use. Ai is a joke. ""Generative Expand"" doesn't expand the image as it should. It just distorts my original image and slaps it onto a larger resolution plain colored backdrop. It's hilariously bad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super useful app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Just great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"perfect 👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be my goto, but now, with the ads taking forever and having to pay for it really made me look for an alternative. Reply : Like I said, even charging for the AI is a bit much considering its open source software. The ad run times are too much. I get it. It pays the ads, and you dont have 100% control over when you sign on playstore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good to nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awasome app. I like it.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible update to the app! The collage maker function in this app is now so difficult to use compared to previously! Bring back the old one!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"A good app. Not willing to pay more than once for it. I already paid for an ACTUAL graphic design setup on PC. If you can't negotiate to pay for it with ad space, it's definitely not worth a subscription, IMO. Good luck, though!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since it's update and price increase this app is meh. This was my go to on the fly photo editing app I used alongside Lightroom. But now it's just expensive and focused on AI. Sad when good things get changed and made worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Worth"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One star for not showing a price until I downloaded your app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Would love to give more than 2 stars, but the app is buggy. Couldn't start a free trial or subscribe. Couldn't sign in. Couldn't do much of anything so it got deleted and I found another app to do what I needed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is good WHEN IT WORKS. At the moment I can't use pixlr because it says ""goole Play service unavailable"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Most favorite!! Facts facts facts 🖤🌪️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Still no way to save removed background images as png?? Horrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use this app all the time to make pictures for flashcards for school. It works really well for what I need! Edit: They completely removed the ability to move photos around in the collage section. You used to be able to drag the photo and swap its place with a different photo already in the collage. Now, you have to go all the way into the camera roll to select a different photo. Also, the editing banner at the bottom, covers part of the photo you're currently editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"He utilizado ésta App por unos buenos 10 años, es excelente para editar y mejorar imágenes, la mejor parte es que es gratis."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to be a great app. now it's a clickbait, ad-filled, ""get the Premium Version!"", AI garbage. Very sad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"nic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your ads made you the best app or top 3 to absolute trash and unusable ! Soooo sad !!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The cost is too high"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best of apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Exceptional assortment of tweaks and tools, with not too steep a learning curve"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"yup"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GOOD . JUST GO ON ...👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pay to use bs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good before all the AI trash they added in."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app really seems to be declining after being my go-to for several years. Nothing happens after selecting ""x"" on the notification popup about subscription price increases, making it impossible to exit out of to actually use the app. Then again, maybe such bad and unresponsive UI is to be expected from yet another tech company pushing soulless GenAI rubbish that nobody asked for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used the app occasionally for years and it was always great. Now, there are nag screens for monthly subscriptions and several ads after every action. No thanks! Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"changing your name doesn't make you AI powered all of a sudden."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not happy with the newest update. I have been using Pixlr for years and it has served me well! Unfortunately, nothing lasts free forever, now there is a message every time you go into it, urging to pay and subscribe, there is still the free version, but now, 3 ads come up before you can save your work! I will be uninstalling, sadly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be very good but now it's full of scammy ads all the time, it's so annoying and sometimes when you want to save your pictures, an intrusive ad pops and you can't get rid of it without killing the app and launch it again!!! Greedy system"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Liked it, but dont feel giving away my personal details and phone usage for profit in return for a ""free"" app is a good thing, sorry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using PIXLR since 2010. Every Photo got Enhanced. Yesterday I unfortunately updated this app since 2018 version, and you changed the platform with Ai. NOW you want to start charging $$$ for using it. In 2010 I gave this App a 5 Star review. Other Photoshop Editors are Free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too censored"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app mostly for the collage feature, which is now unusable. I liked that i could change the aspect ratio, and there were numbers at the top so every image i created was the same aspect ratio. Now, there are no numbers, and every time I click on an image while in the free aspect section, it kicks me out and I have to go back in, but it resets the aspect! Not unusable at all! Please change it back! The ads are also really really annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"most useful app.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"gratitude, you've helped me do simple and complex ish edits!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Bring back the previous version for collage, the new one is not user friendly!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great editing app, absolutely love the filter options."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"January 2025 update: This app used to be intuitive and easy to use but now it is slow and buggy. I would really love it if you guys could speed up the AI tools you have added and fix the bugs. You shouldn't have to wait so long for AI content to be generated and you definitely shouldn't get errors half the time or more when generating Nov 2024 update. I had some issues after subscribing but the developer contacted and advised me to reinstall and all my problems are now solved. Thanks team!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I bought this for generative fill. Most times you end up staring at your image with no changes, yet a credit is missing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"free version gives you some options...but paid version gives you everything!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Now it won't even get past the ad screen to save a simple collage. Uninstalling..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This new version is horrible, ads ads and more ads to make money."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"why make me subscribe for 1 year ,,i need that money ,,can i get a refund?? i badly needed that money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trash. Saved files are nowhere to be found."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"ads are distracting...can't complete my editing photos properly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"on my old phone pixlr was great. on new phone s24 it's absolutely rubbish!! soooo many adverts and taking away pointless time. probably find different app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"chronic stack of ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There's too many ads and things that used to be free are now pay to use. I also hate this shameless cash grab they're doing integrating AI. This app is pretty unusable now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Collage feature has become unusable. I used to he able to drag and swap images to make sure they were in the right place. I'm making a collage with 9 text images that need to go in order, and instead of left to right, up and down, the photos I select load in on a chart up down then left to right. I used to be able to easily fix this, but now I have to click on an image, click edit, go to my camera roll and find the right one for that spot. I don't know who implemented this change, but it's awful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is hands down my favorite photo editing app! I have been using it for years!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"that's good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"unable to zoom-in the background in the process of adding text. also, it results in a very blurry when we save to <10% of a large image size. would be nice if there was an option to adjust the shape and size of the collage frames manually instead of templates with fixed frame size & ratio."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Invasive ads during saving of projects causing you to sometimes lose your work and therefore forcing you to get the paid version out of sheer frustration bordering on extortion. App was great, but lately it's gone downhill because of their marketing strategy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Please add 5:4 and portrait image ratios"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App ruined by ads and AI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be good till they started flirting with terrible ads, horrible pricing structure and the dreaded AI. Where are the new fonts, features, bug fixes? A barren wasteland, full of ash, and fire, and debris. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with 10,000 subs could you do this. It is folly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"nice 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It don't want open up"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"investible software for and for all. I highly recommend it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to work great, now has weird marks on the saved image file which looks awful. * the heal tool leaves gray speckles wherever it was used."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This was my #2 favorite go to for editing my pics. Now there's things I can't find or access and its very frustrating."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"v good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was my fave app i used it for very very long time, but subscription? Really? I am very disappointed, i will uninstall it now, cause now its not that app that i used to know"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used Pixel for some time now. I love it!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, but recent update has 'slowed it down'. Having to long press to move a picture instead of swiping the selected image is inconvenient. Spacing for sizing is messed up too, etc. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. It was more simple to use. New changes make it frustrating. I've always paid to use this and loved it, but I'm not enjoying it anymore and I only use this when not using the ""big name editor""."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Utilities totally gutted or burried under garbage, ads, and packed with spyware. Goodnight sweet prince. I remember the things we made together before your guts were ransomed. App finally managed to force update itself. Solution is called FOSS."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The new update has made the collage maker entirely unusable. Entirely inaccessible and completely ruins the ability to even use it. Much prefer the older version of it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App updated and now it's freezing, I don't seem to be able to get past editing the photos, also unknown if I can change the size of the edging. This app seems to be getting worse with each update not better. Well have to look for a new app for editing photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app often, and they ruined it just to add a gimmick that's inherently immoral and ultimately unprofitable. Hope whichever business heads suggested this get jobs they're actually suited for, like table waiting."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"superb"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dreadful update. I want something simple which is why I use pixlr. If i wanted fancy gimmicks i would use photoshop. I can not save anything to my device due to some error and after waiting 10 minutes for background removal I gave up. Now you are putting prices up!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't like it, because you have a premium"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Turned the app into real trash, no tools for free users at all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I bought premium use of this app and now they're telling me to subscribe as well and ignoring that i bought it entirely. They also changed the UI and lost a ton of funcrionality. Really disapointed and wish the legacy app was available id bought."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This is a new anomaly; I'm using the same phone I've been using for years. The app, now, 'freezes', about 80% of the time, these, days - when superimposing images (e.g., loading an image into a black template)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"01/2025 Hate the new update 😒"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used to be the best, now when I crop and save a picture I get a different crop than what I selected☹️ 12 jan... got updated and it works perfectly again! Thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"it's nicely done"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"beautiful designing app thank you pixel"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"just a great little image manipulation app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After the update, it became inconvenient, it saves pictures without asking how to save them. A convenient application turned into a clumsy unnecessary program, of which there are hundreds in the market."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Simply an excellent free app, could easily charge money but don't, really 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Can't believe I have been using Pixlr for over 10 years. It's my go-to app to quickly modify and edit an image. I've seen it change throughout the years, sometimes I liked the updates, other times I didn't, but the functions have always worked and I appreciate this app for everything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, on multiple devices. Never felt the need to pay for it, the free functions were great! I loved it! But ever since they added the AI and changed the whole UI, the app is laggy, doesn't properly save my pictures (they come out blank sometimes), and it's just an excruciating experience now. I'm searching for another photo editing app, and when I find a good one, I'll be uninstalling this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app to get most of my album cover art done. I love how easy and effective this app is"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"my favorite 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for years but yesterday it crashed as there was a bug in this app. I liked this app but had to uninstall as it's not working even after clearing the cache. 😢"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"its oky"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They shifted to ai slop after being a solid image editing software for years. Extremely disappointed. Go find other apps that don't scoop to this level of pathetic business practices."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I hate AI and no one ever asked for these features to clunk up these apps and give them an excuse to charge you more. otherwise great. Just get rid of AI."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Whatever I try to do, it says permission is denied while I have given permissions required. It used to be a good app, but not anymore. Edit: Since you've said that bug is with mobile device and version, there is no point in sharing anything with you. I will switch the app. Thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good application for photo editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Greed got the best of this developer with the tremendous price increase."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The issues I was encountering appear to have been resolved. Would be 5 stars without the long ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I was a longtime user but have now stopped using Pixlr because I can't stand generative ai. It's proven to be an awful waste of precious resources like water and power, and it looks so ugly. please stop."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best of the best. Used to use this app as a teen. I'm happy they still have it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"lovely effects for your photos. Brighten them up, and enhance them in many different ways. Love experimenting with them"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Use to love this app... then out of the blue they went to a pay service. If you want an easier to use free photo editor look else where!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using for years, but then, BOOM! update and now non stop glitches and problems. Keeps resizing my images and texts. Has become unusable for me, and now I gotta find a new app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great until they wanted a freaking subscription"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"they removed what was good and made it bad, screwing over people who paid for the app previously."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My new favorite art tool!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"easy to navigate"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This pretty much just stopped working for the past week. Used to be great. My go to. Now it's not even responding or anything. Hopefully it's going through some complete upgrade transition. I think I used to pay for this too. Now I guess I don't lol."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"pretty good especially the editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UNREASONABLE PRICE CHANGES. I've had this app for so long and my absolute favorite, I would recommend to everyone I could but as of recent updates asking for payments... I want to delete, bad review and tell my friends I previously recommend to delete. So disappointed ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've had this app over 10 years, paid for ONCE, and over the last year have watched it become just like every other mid, wannabe Midjourney/Photoshop. $80 a year? Credits? GenAI? We never used this app to STEAL art, we used it to create our own. Major disappointment."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for years. But latest update has issues. If u put a blank piece of paper up and try to add photo's… when u go to position them.. There seems to b an invisible margin. Then when you place the photo where you want then tick to confirm.. The photo jumps to another position. Help please"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be free now its subscription based :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The new update has just spoiled the functioning of the application. Now, it creates bugs and malfunctions a lot."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but . . . I think it must be the latest update that is getting in my way. I can't crop properly, double exposures have become troublesome. I won't be upgrading (?) to a paid plan while these problems exist."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixar used to be my go to. But apparently all the focus has changed to AI garbage. The heal tool doesn't even work properly anymore. Once you save the image, all the healed spots are highlighted in green."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's a great app that I've been using for a long time but there are flaws with the recent update. It's not allowing me to crop images properly and when I overlay images, they move in position when I tap the check box"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Buggy update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used this app so much!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really excellent and best of all editors."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The recent update has messed up the cropping function rendering it unusable on my Samsung Galaxy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Nice apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great. I used it more than any other. Now it's extremely buggy, crashes and the ads are overwhelming. I'm throwing in the towel."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"a lot of annoying ads now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be a really nice, useful app. Then the adverts got it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"there are other free apps like Snapseed better tools and it's free pixlr bye bye free use on 25th Jan 2025 whamp-waaaaaaaaahp suckas also the unsubscribe instructions don't work funny that seems like they wanna make it opt out rather than opt in"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super 🥰🥰"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"deep fried image"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,",⚡⚡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app all the time and really loved it for simple edits to my photos. Today I come back to it to find that there is now a monthly subscription fee WITH obnoxious ads. I'd be ok with ads on a free version, but this is ridiculous. Also, they now have integrated AI. I'm not interested in giving money to anything that encourages more AI-generated slop. This was a great app that has now been ruined."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AHHHH"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"new adverts feed makes the app terrible to use. tried saving photos twice and they go nowhere. shame as I used to like it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"it's great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superrr really good Design"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Helps make things look cool 😎 Basically.. Many options and ways to fade the pix ,,, definitely recommend"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Idk what you guys did to it but when I double exposure to add a Pic I click and it moves it from where i want it. Never using the app again until that glitch is fixed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Woof, from free to paid because they put in ""AI"" trash actual no artist wants? Bye! I'll be finding another app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dumb app so bad that I have no constructive criticism"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"MR [$] MARIO DUMORNAY OKEY YES GOOD 👌 😃 TODAY'S YES"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No more like old days too man ads + corp and paste image also didn't work properly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years but they decided to start using generative AI and even added it in the name so I deleted it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've loved this app for several years now, and have a paid subscription. Now there's this pivot to AI- which is incredibly intrusive. I didn't ask for it, I don't want it, but I don't have the option to turn it off. And to add insult to injury, they're skyrocketing the subscription costs to pay for all the extra fluff that nobody asked for. Sadly saying goodbye to this app and shopping around for something better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Rubbish after latest update. Had bought the paid version long back. But now it doesn't allow to restore purchase. Advertisements aplenty. Would give Zero stars if allowed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for many years, but unfortunately - like everywhere else for some reason, it's now fallen to generative AI slop. Incredibly disappointed. Am uninstalling as a result."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid for this app probably 8 years ago. Never had issues, used it for a lot of different things. Adding in AI was the dumbest thing in the world. Guess I'm finding a different app now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app.But for some reason it's gotten much harder to use. I don't know if it's because of new AI ""features"" trying to ""assist"" or something, but I can no longer crop images the way I want. The framing keeps locking into set positions (even when I use Free mode) and even when I do get the crop to look how I want it comes out different anyway. I've noticed similar issues with other features as well. I used to recommend this app, now I'm not sure I'll keep using it myself"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updated 1 1 2025. ad blasts while trying to save images and then saves 2 of the same image. This used to be a great app. No wonder Chromebooks no longer support it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love ♥️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"old app achaa hai"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No instructions"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"amazing app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cropping is not working well. I tried cropping a sentence out then I confirmed it and it cropped another part of the image/text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"oooooookkk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice 👍🙂"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice ap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Includes all the useful features, and minimal intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was amazing for collaging photos but recent updates have made it less user-friendly and added adverts. Will be looking for something new."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WORST SCROLLING FUNCTION. 90% of the time it will scroll in the wrong direction"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using Pixlr for well over 10+ years. I remember PAYING for this app years ago (for no ads and other stuff) for what I thought was lifetime, but now, years later, the paywalls have increased and things that were FREE are now for PAY. ""Recovering previous purchases"" no longer recovers anything for me. It just acts like I'm a new/free user. You WERE a wonderful app, but the bait and switch, along with the greediness, I just can't...uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Seriously one of the best undisputed image editing apps in the world - which it has been for as long as I can remember. Pretty much all the features you could want, laid out in a very simple, practical and user-friendly way."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"a very nice app. easy to use. i've been using this for 5 yrs. now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"lots of options and easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best👍👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Became trash after the AI and submission update. Now the ads are all over your face like a Chinese android game for kids."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to great. Not so much lately. Cropping tool doesn't work. Doesn't crop where you mark out. Less AI, more functionality please."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ai theft tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Recently become ad ridden. You'll have to hit X three times to save a single image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like it 💯Excellent👍I gave you full stars.😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"There is a big glitch in double exposure feature now. It changes position after clicking done. 😭😭😭😭😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Price increased twice in short time. Trying to cancel is a hassle."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They can't keep their prices the same for more than a few months. Pixlr/Autodesk excuse for extortion:"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great now it's garbage, just like everything else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great, until they riddled it with ads. Junk. Find another app at this point."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very nice 👍 app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Been using this app for about 10 years. Lots of good editing tools, filters, frames, stickers, overlays and fonts. There have been some crashes: sure, bugs: yea. Ads? not a big deal. But this last month they've been really pushing the Ai editing(as a creative that doesn'tsit well). And now they want to start a subscription service at the end of the month. Been happy with the free version for so long, but had to uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Seems that they shot themselves in the foot with this one. I'm not I'm not the only one who dislikes the ""last chance"" ad model. It's like ""Here's a game 45 secs later, are you sure? Another 15 secs later? Here's your last chance."" There are plenty of other options some are even ad free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"NOISE"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ai scammery"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good quality app, just wish you could do more than 10 pix for a collage. other than that, no issues"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"the app is turning into garbage, it won't even save edits. not to mention the scam of ""increased operating costs"" raising the premium price. they must take us for idiots. they added a few ai interfaces and tweaks, not a worldclass upgrade. i didn't ask for a trashy ai. i want my old app back. i'm thinking about taking legal action. premium used to be $11 per year, now they want $10 per month! absolutely bonkers. i'm never making another purchase again to these greedy asshats."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling because you've added Generative AI. I opened the App after not using it for a few weeks and was smacked in the face with the subscription model and AI Coins, as well as GenAI on the home page. As an art lover, and an artist, this disgusts me. I've used this App for years and recommended it to others; I will no longer do either."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Subscription based service"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is no longer useful between the addition of AI, the ads, and the cost of the app if ads were to be removed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for years, and it was the best. Now it is expensive because it's added on a bunch of features that I don't really think are necessary. I keep trying to change my subscription to get it down to a cheaper price, but I cannot pull it up on my android. They got me stuck into a plan I don't want to be in anymore, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. If it wasn't broken, it didn't need fixing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Had it for years as my go-to photo editor, now it's bloated with all subscription features, full of aggressive video ads. Instead of expanding and enhancing UX, it corrupted the existing UX. Time to part ways unfortunately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I'm still recieving the same error code 401 when I try and use the AI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"awesome app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not Worth It, Pass."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Way too many ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"ive been very loyal to pixlr for years now. its been really frustrating watching them go from a great free alternative to photoshop to what it is now. recently theyve been shoving useless ai features into their services, and seemingly putting all of their budget into them. this means every other aspect of this service (the parts people actually use) suffer significantly. for example on the website you need to pay if you want to save more than 3 times in one day. also please add layers to mobile"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"badiya nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Has been just great for me... Got tons of things!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great for free, better w/subscription. Adds can be annoying but don't get in the way too much. been using it for years and have always been happy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a good app until introducing all the ads and b.s. AI tools. Now they're going to require a subscription"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Needlessly bloated. Irritating opening screen. Worth it for the double exposure function and text function."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"easy to edit. easy to learn. ive used this app and only this app to create edit so many different tasks. cant give it enough stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this app is lovely"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a useful quick editor, now full of unnecessary, unwanted ai bloat, uninstalled immediately"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great Application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"so amazing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love their easy to use image editors ..been using it for years... great job Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ads in Chinese so I don't know what is the button to download"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"i used to use this as my default photo editor for simple things like adding text, color picking and drawing, etc. but now it has become a weird ai-obsessed app with too many advertisements that doesn't even let me properly save the pictures i edited at the end... uninstalled and will find a different app to use. also all this generative ai stuff is super unethical (look up its environmental and human impacts) and nobody needs all of that bs"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"one of my favorite editing aps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Change the icon back! Stop forcing AI services on us. We use pixlr because it's a tool. Ai isn't able to do what we need to do and on the level we need it done 👍🏿. Please don't waste our time. You have many loyal users but we will leave."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Same story as so many others before me... was a great app for years, then they moved to a new subscription model and stranded all of us who bought the old pro version, forcing AI and a crazy amount of ads onto us. Goodbye, Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love new Addition. Over 13 years of use 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your app is constantly signing my out of my account, I'm signed in using my Google account? I have to uninstall & reinstall to sign in again to have access to my AI credits! I bought into the App before you went to a subscription format! Are you trying to force me into a subscription? Very unethical business practices! Please fix this for users like me who purchased your pro edition before you went to a subscription format! I just want access to the credits I purchased! Not dependable!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've owned this app for years. I purchased it outright and now it's asking me to purchase a subscription.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"*EDITED* The app won't even load for me anymore. It opens up to the first screen, and there's nothing I can do from there. There are no buttons, no links, nothing....just a screen saver that changes every time I re-open the app. I deleted and re-downloaded it the next day, and now I have to pay for the app.....?? Why not offer a free version. Guess I have to look for a new app now :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"it's nice but I still don't understand the obsession for AI. THAT STUFF'S GONNA BE THE END OF US ALL I'M TELLING YOU!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm tired of monthly subscriptions"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I bought a lifetime plan before the AI feature came out, why do i now get ads? Why not make the AI feature and extra cost for those who already have a lifetime plan??? I dont use the AI feature so please remove these ads!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb app. I use it for every fine art photo that I take."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage. Why did adobe get rid of Photoshop mix."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I bought this app years ago and now it won't restore my purchase, so I have to watch stupid ads if I use it."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrid ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love Pixlr, but the ads are now ridiculous! Sadness. ☹️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"way more ads then there used to be and they last way too long to be worth using this app over others"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The worst in-app ads. Makes me not want to use the app at all."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"its good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome 👍👍👍👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic photo editor, wide functionality, able to get the job done. Now opening up the app it's frontloaded with AI nonsense, popups trying to get me to enable notifications, premium subscriptions... I don't want any of this. The original good editor is in there but I'm not putting up with this anymore. Just give me an app that does what I need without wasting my time and assaulting me with attention-hungry slop. Edit regarding developer response: not once did I complain about ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"To save a photo now means sitting through three ads - it's become an ad nightmare. Ads clutter the bottom of the screen while you work, disrupting everything. The claim of 'maintenance' is a thin veil for sheer greed. This app, once user-friendly, now pushes for profit over experience. The AI, meant to enhance, only destabilizes. Bombarding us with premium subscription prompts shows where priorities lie. It's not about improving the app but filling pockets. You guys are being greedy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What used to be a simple but effective image editor that I could rely on for quick edits away from my computer, is now filled with AI and ads. A big shame really"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"the app is nothing like the website, the first thing i get when i open the app is an ad for an overpriced subscription. all that this app can do my inbuilt photo editor can do better, even the ""AI"" features are bad, just don't even bother with this app it's trash"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There's too much ads now. This app is turning to trash."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Gone downhill big time with all the ads. Usd to be really good, now the ads make it very annoying"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"perfect app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have used this app for years and even paid for some add-ons. NOW you have to watch an add to save the image. One particular ad simply doesn't stop!! You can't close it to go back, giving you virus vibes! You have to close the whole window which inevitably results in losing your work!! Oh yeah, and the AI-feature is completely unnecessary too! LATE-STAGE CAPITALISM IS SO MUCH FUN!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"adds"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awsome app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have had this app on my phone for years. It is clean and easy to use app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app has been broken for years and now has shameless AI tools that are useless over countless updates and now 4 different phones the SAME issue still hasn't been fixed with the Retro text options, over half of them are just the same basic sans text over and over, the special fonts are basically non-existent in that specific category and it's been that way for YEARS now with no fix in sight garbage app, unfortunately there's no better free app out there that offers this amount of editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for 9 years and counting. I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app to convert MBs to KBs and autofix just rocks ! I've reduced my ""images"" storage by 75%. 36 MB freed up by autofix in Pixir tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ads Way Too Intrusive. And don't tell me I can pay for no ads. I've been using this app for 12 years. I'm not paying your ridiculous subscription fees. A one-time payment, sure. I could deal with that. The truth is, you've all gotten so greedy. The app isn't any better than it was five or six years ago, and yet you want to charge us unreasonable fees to do away with ads. I understand that you need to advertise to support the app, but your ads take forever. Tik Tok ads are the worst."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome! 💯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Everything you could possibly want without going broke on Photoshop!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be decent, but now it forces long irrelevant ads on you at the rudest times. Just not worth it anymore. There are other free apps, with no ads or very few short ads, to edit photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They added ""AI"". Now it is just stuck at the loading screen. Thanks AI."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One of the first apps I ever installed on a smartphone, unfortunately they got greedy, pop ups and now an ad before you can save a picture. Uninstalled"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sad. Now no longer a free app to edit photos. Have used for years with no complaints. Sad that I cannot afford the cost. Delete"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Pixlr.I used the app for nearly 5 years but I am a free-alternative guy. You can pay for your a.i by yourself and use it with your own money for whatever. So good bye 👋"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads with fake close buttons."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads now, after using this for over a decade I have to find another program"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years. I have a bunch of unfinished pic's I was working on. Now, I can't even open the app to finish them. Very disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app since 2014. But the ads suck. I love it but can't afford it 😔 'starving artist's"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this pixlr App,past 10 years ago because easy to use with latest technology."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used this app since I was a sophomore in Highschool & always swore by it. I even looked past the repetitive onslaught of ads & purchased an ad-free subscription. However, these recent updates shoving AI down my throat have finally got me shopping around for an alternative. The price for a yearly subscription recently went up by a substantial amount & the culprit is this AI BS that nobody asked for! You wanna lose your customers? Because that's how you lose your customers!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Originally I would have given Pixlr 5 stars, without ever thinking about it. Now, I don't know how long I'll want to use it. I've had pixlr across multiple devices, edited hundreds of photos, and for years, never had a complaint or a bad thing to say. Until now. It's almost like it's been taken over with ads and the push of an AI subscription service. Go back to the beautiful Pixlr you were, not this peasant masquerading in the shadow of a god."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"genuinely love Pixlr feels very familiar"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great free app for image editing, non intrusive ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"so nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"ads are overwhelming."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"using this app for almost a decade i think. if it aint broke, don't switch it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"too much long ads of fraud company and apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best photo editor app ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely obnoxious ads, infinitely worse than anything I can remember when I first installed this years ago."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"horribly intrusive adverts. and even after watching a 3 minute advert before it would save my edit, it didn't save anything."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I looked like this app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love the app and is now on my new phone. I have knocked up collages, custom lockscreens, all sorts of good stuff. But now it looks like I'm going to have to uninstall. The three page leaflet on subscriptions is a pain. Yes it's only a click, but it's ruining the experience. I actually don't want to use the app because I know it's there. Now ads have started. Thanks for all the help but I'm off. Bye, bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The user that complained about the Ads and AI being nothing then overwhelming which you the developer replied to him that the ads are there to support the app. Did you really not understand or is it just a game to you. He was in no way suggesting you cannot have ads which was your immediate reply. He clearly stated you played the underhanded game creepy developers play which to is be almost ad free until users start adopting an app and slowly add more ads until it sucks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good 👍"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great tools for editing photos!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's awful. Used this app for Months, it *was quiet + useful. Lately - on Startup - it will PUSH their Subscription Service + AI where you have to Dismiss it - twice. I have Notifications turned off for the App, in Device Settings. It now has a built-in Message prompting you to re-enable it, everytime you use the App. And - now has long ADS each time you try to save a Photo to your Device. App is greedy, and has officially worn out my patience. Lost a full time user. Bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You ruined this app. Every time I try to save an image, I'm bombarded with ads. Do not install this garbage app anymore."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best photo editing app. Now it's AI garbage that forces a paid subscription. Absolute dog water."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Away with your wicked ""plans"". We are not your employers. Uninstalling. Used 2014 - 2023. previous rating ***** Definitely the best photo editor for Android."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for the past 10 years and this is by far my absolute favorite photo editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Longtime user, but the ads have become much too long recently, which is a shame. I will be looking for a different photo editor app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update 12.1.24. There were less ads for months, but they're back with a vengeance. No I do not want AI, no I am not paying for a photo app as there are a million free ones. Can rarely save a photo without an assault of apps again. Shopping for a replacement app. **** I have used this app for years! But now the ads are out of control (at last 30 sec long before I can save a photo- unacceptable. No other free ad-based app I've ever used makes you watch anything for that long). So annoyin"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"over adds"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Immediate get hit up for money = immediate uninstall"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cannot easily write notes on photos with Motorola stylus.. immediately starts nagging for paid subscription.. uninstalled.. no thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Old app please Almost a month later. I still truly dislike this Big Brother wannabe. I want a previous version not this. I'm more than a little insulted AI is so calously pushed by so many otherwise good apps. Horrible!!!!. Truly awful. This used to be pretty good. Now it has a mind of its own. This monster owns your phone, your first born and your dog. Why does everything have to suddenly turn into TEMU???? How can you justify such shameless begging? I could not despise this thing more."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it's good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This one is the best free app for picture editing! At least for me, it's the greatest!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid for no ads. Ads. Use Snapseed. Reinstalled. Nope. Still ads. More even."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app im using it for 5 years new updates woth ai is amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Where are my saved photos going. Pathetic it is to do all the work and see that the location is bot fetched by my gallery app and not available for access from files app. Please update"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Decent image editor for years, turned nagware. Constantly wants permission to send notifications. I wonder how much longer I'll resist deleting the app because of tha"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, the recent update has added adverts that must be watched before you can successfully save an edited image. If you do not watch them, all the editing is lost. This is ridiculous. Uninstalled. EDIT: There we multiple ethical ways to implement adverts into the application, but forcing users to watch an advert before they can save an image isn't one of them. If you are struggling to generate revenue, it's because the app isn't worth paying for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I did not ask for AI nonsense in my app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great way to make photo collage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Thanks for updating and making my favorite picture editing app my least favorite by bombarding it with ads before I can save a picture... Deleting App now!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"নাইস"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All I want is a lasso or be able to add an image with custom alpha. I wish I could just install an old version of picsart."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be reliable, but I will not allow AI applications on my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"to many adds pop ups"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"App did its job very well, but had to uninstall because the recent update introduced too many intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app previously & enjoyed it. the free side gave a lot of options with few ads. I only uninstalled it because I had too many apps. I decided to reinstall it recently. There were nice updates since I last used it so I was interested. However, the app is disappointing. Can't log in using Google, keep getting errors and the app ffreezes up. Ridiculous number of ads now to do anything. Signed up by email, tried to delete account, guess it takes 30 days. Can't do anything. uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Bad ads hard to not click on. Plus the AI didn't ever get it right when removing backgrounds, which is pretty much all i wanted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It wanted me to subscribe just to crop a photo. Android seems to have lost the ability to simply crop a photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are extremely intrusive, dark patterns are used to make ads inescapable, you need a tier 1 ninja skill or an IQ above Einstein to escape their inescapable ads shown after every edit, if u close app without watching 3 layered (you have to close one ad 3 times) ad, image won't be saved; not to mention micro transactions, most of it is locked away under subscriptions."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been a Pixlr user for 4 years. 3 stars for 3 good years. I'm leaving for a few reasons. Mainly because Pixlr refuses to work within unfettered internet access. I've tried multiple VPN configs and the app keeps throwing errors which magically disappear when VPN is off. Also, you shouldn't charge people to use the app offline. I'm fine watching couple of ads here and there. PSX is more robust, has no pay wall, and no ads. Just sign in with my free Adobe ID."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Advertisements out of control. Playing on loud and pressing the mute button just opens a pop-up link to a website. Fail."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Their tools have been going downhill. Try to resize a brush, palette disappears & u get a massive dot in the middle of your photo. 🤬 Found a work around because I love them, have subscribed for 4+ years now. Spent 2 hrs on a cool pic, thought I'd look at some of their AI tools & what? I'm not logged in?? Error on login & restore purchase...lost ALL my work. Checked my Google subscriptions and I'm pd thru June '25 & set up for renewal. Not anymore, time to find something better. :( Disappointed."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This use to work great, and it tells me now to login with my Google account and it won't allow Google. Says it's not allowed. I paid for this and now won't work!!!! Do NOT download this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"advertisements, user interface is visually trash...same great features that's always made it the reliable editing app that it is...Only now has a cheap & sloppy aesthetic and the advertisements have progressed from quick pop up ads to videos when saving projects."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The free app, in general, is ehhh/ok/plain... lttl bttr than most IN SOME AREAS not good enough to consider buying... Sorry folks 😔. The detail/simplicity of the app is easy but adjusting nething = ehhh/ovrkill, also; no sharpness and clarity tools, AUTO modes hrdly nething, auto fix didn't do nething, Biggie 👉Buying coins!! This being the sales killer!! The digital coin buying/spending idea 2 USE SM tools is a cash eater!! 6x strokes 1 part/still nt erased. Other free apps/2x=erased"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love this App!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I did not leave a review and I found that I had apparently left 5 stars here"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Used it for a decade, but now there are lots of advertisements, which wasn't the case a few years ago. I understand it, though, if they need to run their business. App has been helpful on many occasions, especially when you need to edit photos quickly. I definitely recommend it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super App easy work to photo shop I am used in 5 year above super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to use this app all the time. branding itself as AI over a decade later. immediate uninstall and one star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've always loved this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app so much that I paid for it. But now, every time I open it, I get a pop up demanding that I allow notifications. NO. I do not need notifications from the photo editor that I'm paying for. This annoying addition has rendered the app unpleasant to the point where I don't use it anymore. I will not be renewing my subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've gotten unskippable long ads while just trying to save TWO different times, what's your deal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used this app for years and never had a problem once I got over the learning curve. I use it for pretty simple edits to amuse myself but I'm disappointed in the direction the app has taken. The integration of AI image generation is deeply saddening to see, and the new push to pay for premium plans is really intrusive and annoying. The new UI also isn't very good, it works fine enough but the old style was perfect, no reason to change it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"fine"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Please, Fix Save Option.; Thank You.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Deserve million stars 😜"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app keeps me on the main screen and doesn't take me to any of the tools to use for edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The new update was a major downgrade. Nobody asked for AI functions, or a tidal wave of ads. If you use the desktop website you get limited to 3 saves per day unless you want to pay for a subscription. Devs got greedy and the app suffered for it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's good to have the kind of variety"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very useful app. can edit pictures with ease and that too with any AI command."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was fantastic and fit all of my needs, until the latest update. Now it wont open at all. Starting to regret paying for it. Edit: Came back and it has turned into AI garbage. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"i've been using this app for a decade at this point, and the new ai stuff and the subscription pop up every time i open it is driving me nuts. please put it back to normal!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for many years, across multiple phones. But AI means bye-bye. I'm not destroying the planet to edit some photos. Uninstalling now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"why do I have ads if I'm a premium account holder.... lame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It keeps crashing, every use of Liquify pixelates more and more the image, the ads X button doesn't work, it always takes you to the Play Store"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good Editor for free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"used to be good but now the ads are too intrusive. features are still fine"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"very nice 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"great app. now with new features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app isn't the greatest to be honest... the website is WAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY better than this app. and it has WAAAAAAAAYYYYYY more features and options. sorry pixlr, but if this app was even remotely similar to your website, then it would get more stars out of me. its almost like your website and your app are two completely different companies."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using since 2013.i Perfecto..very awesome and excellence...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm trying to sign up for making a subscription but can't because of error 401. Non stopping loading."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This was my favorite app, especially the AI feature, allowing me to remove parts of an image or background. Lately it has been crashing and not allowing me to use the AI feature. Even after loosing my coin purchase. Very frustrating."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"user friendly.. Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What has happened? I have been using this app as a subscriber for 10 years and loved it. Now it is a mess. Why change something that worked so well? It isn't even compatible now with the device I use most. I will be cancelling my subscription. LEAVE THINGS ALONE!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years to edit my drawings/photos. After the AI update it has been glitching on my phone to the point where my phone freezes. Today my phone freezed and screen went black, I couldn't even reset it normally, I had to hold down physical buttons to do it. I do not recommend it.. I will download something better. Edit: I don't want to lose my photos to some ugly AI machine (again) so I won't change my mind and redownload : )"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I already have a subscription, but always failded to login"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads. Dont tell me they are there for app maintenance when you also advertise a set of subscription models to fully use the app. Find a new image editor, this turned in to another AI cashgrab app with constant ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed at the direction this app has gone to. The features provided are not good enough or unique enough to justify paying for it, which is a shame considering the increase in invasive ads. Could be used as a master class in how to ruin a great app and turn it into a soulless cash grab. Not to mention the people who've been using this just wanted a photo editing app, not some AI thing. (Edit) Cool stock response"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best app so far"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice app 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's good for what I need it for. I use it just about every day mostly to crop images."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I haven't used this in a long time, but it just played three video ads after saving a minor photo edit. gotta pay for all those features no one asked for, I guess"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Time to uninstall. I've used Pixlr for several years, but the recent addition of full screen adverts you have to sit through (and fight with to close) has made the app unuseable. It would have had 4 or 5 stars, but I've only given it 2."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"A once great app ruined by constant adverts and horrible ai integration."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Can you get legacy Pixlr? The new AI one sucks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, but the new focus on AI and abundance of Ads makes it worthless. Nice job. You took the best photo editor on the play store and turned it into a steaming pile of shite. I'm not gonna subscribe just to avoid watching ads whenever I save a photo. Get bent. I'm going elsewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"picture is an awesome app that lets me do amazing things with the photos that I take it is a far cry from Photoshop but a better deal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why can't I sign?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"too many ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"recent updates have all but ruined a once great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"3 ads in a row that you have to wait then click a tiny X to close before you can save"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app since 2014, it's crazy how 10 years went so fast but anyways this app never disappointed me, way before AI it was the best among all apps, it had all features and it's simple for those who only uses basic tools in their editing and enhanced for those who wants more options, now they even added AI generator and other options, wich is great so we don't have to switch to other apps to try that. I really recommend it, this app will never fail you 💗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was the best lite weight app for so long. The ads are too excessive now. You're better off using Adobe at this point."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"love the app, hate the ads that pop up with sound at inappropriate times"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"after update to 3.65, cannot login by google account, error code 401"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing App, I am using this app regularly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"app needs way more clear and sharp effects"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Chock full of ads to the point of annoyance now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad ai ...... good ai Hypic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great Work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"soooparr👌👌👌👌👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The tools below for picture editing are all lumped together. It used to be very good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Anu t"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The amount of Ads in the free version are shockingly excessive and in violation of EU rules."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an app to simply edit the true hue for images for a long time. (ex. from red to green or just evenly change to entire color scale for an image) every ""advanced"" photo editor lacks having a simple way to do this. many editors have a counterintuitive hue adjustment tool or one that barely changes the color scale, why even have it? I finally found Pixlr to have the feature I'm looking for! And the quality doesn't degrade as the hue is adjusted! heck yeah! Thanks Pixlr! : )"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"oooosom"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Oct 2034 I'm changing 2another app. July 15,21 Must have been an update. Now letters i type on photos are outlined in black and you cant fade them or tone them down. Hard to select a type style because it doesnt match shown style selected. If im paying for this, please cancel. ++ Was my favorite. When I crop words from a photo etc the words are blurry and not readable. Same when I type words on a photo. 4.30.21 Thank you! I will check! 5.23.22 After 5 different phones, this problem still occurs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I had this App for many years, I loved this App. I cold do anything and had no issues until this update with Ai installed. Ever since that I cant save my pictures automatically to my gallery like it always did. Now I have to put my whole phones information on this app, it is REDICULOUS. Everything because of AI, and that's all to get everyone's information."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app has been great until a recent update. I just went through six unskippable ads to save one picture. How do you go from unobtrusive banner ads and one ad to save, to six unskippable ads with exit buttons that are tiny in the corner that only appear after x seconds? Even this wouldn't matter, but I use the desktop premium version, and it doesn't include premium app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, intuitive tools make it easy to gently enhance, balance, and correct photos. Or, if you feel like it you can go overboard and unrealistically oversaturate and manipulate them. I like having the ability to add text, and/or a copyright mark when the occasion calls for it. It's free and not overly burdened with advertisements. What's not to like?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app has fallen to capitalism. Don't even bother trying to use itanymore tbh. Everything that used to be free now requires watching a full-length ad. I've been using this app for over 10 years and I'm really glad the devs can make money off it, they definitely deserve it, I just wish the stuff that cost money was one-time purchases of new features instead of subscriptions for stuff that used to be free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Unskippable ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've uninstalled this from my phone over 20 times today. It keeps reinstalling itself."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the features for small editing pictures.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"new ads when trying to save has made this app awful to use. was 4 out of 5, now 0 or 1 out of 5."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I was subscribed to this, but noticed it wasnt logged in, so tried to and got some error. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still got the error so pointless be carrying on paying. Cancelled subscription"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Be prepared to be disappointed it won't even save your edit to your phone. This app has become pretty much worthless to me. Time to look for a new app without AI."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good app but expensive"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"exceptional app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used it for about 12 years and it's still the best editing app out there."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app is terrible it doesn't.t work properly I have a 1 year subscription for all features .I can't get them . Don't waist ya money on this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely awful. Can't believe Pixlr has become this bad with the ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best editing app for manual skills"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to like it until it introduced AI."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It stop working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"started crashing and won't save my images properly... they're all pixilated."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"From being a firm favourite, intuitive, easy and comprehensive - the app has become cluttered and absolutely strewn with intrusive, redirecting ads. Awful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Canada and Iran Christianity hacking internet 😞 to people don't speaking on human rights"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WAY too many ads now. I've been using this app for years, but I'm done. It's become unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be an ok app for quick edit, but now gone down the AI spamhole with intrusive ads. Time to find an alternative."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this program for years and it has never failed me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its not free. Its so much costly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have used this app for around 10 years. Has been reliable, and very useful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are ridiculously aggressive and remove all reason to use the app. If you go to try and save it loads a video ad that can't be closed to save your art. It's bad enough that I'm uninstalling this from my phone. Edit- ads are one thing. These are ads that take over the app and break it. Half the time they break the functionality of Pixlr itself so that I can't save or do the function I was trying to do in the first place."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best photo editor with a lot of nice features I've used in many years. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it's fantastic iv been using it for years :)"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"the upgrade ruined the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for many years. After the recent update it keeps asking me to use AI generators and the ads are worse than ever before. A downgrade."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"When removing an object with AI, there is no possibilty of zooming the image so it's difficult to mark objects at the edges"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr is my go-to photo editor! <3 this GOAT 💀"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've paid for so many versions of this app over the years. Now it's full of ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"the intrusive and obnoxious ads just recently added after years of not having any ruined the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very nice application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"greats tools ...but the annoying ads position"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this image editing app for at least a decade and it's still serving me well. For quick and easy (and some relatively advanced) editing and touch ups, this Pixlr app has got your back."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best app for editing pictures, been using it since 2018 and now when i try to save my pic it fails, i think i need to buy premium now in order to save it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid to have your app unlocked not to buy credits or a yearly subscription. Fix it please."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not avail for this my device....đf"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"not the same as when I first started using it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Totally broken- I have been a premium paid user since 2019. this app updated and is 100% broken. now wants me to allow notifications, won't allow log in, one of my favorite and most used apps turned into utter garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Too many ads!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I ❤ it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"PIXLR USER HERE since 2014 on web. Disappointed on last update, too much ads. Uninstall now, looking for another userfriendly editing app with ""less"" ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I agree with PA this was also my go to app for editing for the reason that it didn't have money grabbing ads on it which you are forced to watch to save an image. Surely you as the creators get pissed for having to sit behind ads in other apps so why ad to your own. Now I need to find another ad video free app 😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"only thing missing is the ability to go back into the text edits but otherwise a really handy way to use my subscription when I'm on mobile!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've been a long time user of Pixlr (before they made it an 'AI generative app'). Used to be 5⭐ but now only deserves 3⭐ because of the annoying AI splash screen that can't be turned off every time I start the app. The basic features are still good though"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Added stupid gen AI features. I don't want that garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"too much ads to the point its taking too much time just to save one photo. wont let you go to the next page"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"👍👍👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Now everything is resolved. So giving a 5 star rating. Please add more filter and add some great features like Google photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be my go to photo editor app. Too many ads to click out of now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've had pixler for years and still love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it's a great app 🤌💗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"So disappointed, this app was fantastic for editing but now it's just a constant bombardment of ads ads ads ads pay here nonsense like all the others 😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this for multiple details"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app used it for years. I'm going to find something new now though. The adds are extremely aggressive now, and on top of that, when I save the picture to my phone, there is a black bar down the side of EVERY picture, making them unusable thus in my opinion making this app unusable. It's sad because this was my go-to for photo editing on my phone for a while now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this to do one simple thing I repeatedly just get errors"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a very useful app prior to pivot to Ai. Have no idea how well it works at this point, since every time I have requested a password reset, no email is sent despite my having an account and previously paying to go as well free. Very convenient of them. Update 11/5: Despite showing proof of previous payment for the product, customer ""service"" offers no resolution, no support, no compromise. I urge you all not to spend money with this product. They can arbitrarily decide not to honor payment."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After the recent update the skin tones are getting changed if you upload the photo for editing even if you don't do anything skin tones are getting changed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"way too many ads now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"the worst thing about this app is the copy paste limit of the words.. you cant make and align the whole paragraph of page. pics Art is best in this case . pls increase the word limit upto atleast 3000."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid money for this to be an ad-free app years ago. I bought the ability to never see an ad again. Now I have ads. I would like them removed as I paid you for this, but have them again. It is extremely shady, if not fraud. I understand you are trying to raise cash by doing this. Do it to customers who DIDN'T help you get this far in your business, not the ones who paved the way for you to be here now. (Update 11/2024 : STILL ads!! Reinstalling did NOTHING)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, but now has incredibly intrusive ads and is constantly trying to shove new AI features down your throat. Uninstalling for good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now UNUSABLE BECAUSE OF TOO MANY ADS. If I could give zero stars I would. Shame on you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a fantastic photo editing app before all the AI bloat got added in. What a shame."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"too many ads now. was better 4 yearsago"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Has been my go-to Android photo processor for a while, I'd like to try the full version but the free version is enough for quickly cropping a photo and maybe tweaking the contrast before posting, if you don't mind the occasional Ad."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍🏻"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy tool to edit your pictures. it's compact and effective.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to love this app and used it all the time, despite its flaws, but recently it's been very strange about saving images, and now has stopped saving altogether. It also has much more obtrusive ads now. And adding insult to injury, it shoves its AI stuff in your face at every turn, making me trust it less and less with my art. All these new updates and they didn't even fix the existing issues (like heal tool not working, imprecise color selector, etc). I think I'll look for a new image editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very easy photo editing with lot's of font and variations."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my favourite app but recently it's just become complete trash, crashing, glitching and lagging. Highly disappointing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"previously very good. After update its such disappoinment. every time to save, awals show ads. everytime back to home or launch, always show suncribtion option. Very bad now!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Became another AI sellout and won't stop shoving paid features in your face every time you open the app. Also won't give you a prompt when you accidentally hit the back button on your phone and then you less progress on your edits. Update: of course they would give me an automated response instead of listening to complaints. If y'all want a 5 star rating, get rid of the AI garbage, cut it out with the pop-ups, and then we'll talk."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love Pixlr, but guiltily. It makes people think I'm a killa photographer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This App is a Miracle !!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was a great app before, but now it's fully defeatured layers and replaced it with a terrible proprietary AI engine.. trash.. ending my subscription.. why alienate your users who were happy with your product."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wanted to resize some photos and couldn't find that function."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I just edited my 1st two pictures 📸 I'm impressed 😎 can't wait for the future"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love this apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good app but with some annoyances. I have used the app for many years now and really like how powerful it is with its simplicity. You can do a lot of stuff very quickly and easily, I really like it. Like other reviews say, the latest update did bring with it some annoying popups, particularly the AI ones but I think I have them all dismissed now. If this app had a paid version to remove ads, I would buy it, but I am not paying a monthly subscription to remove ads on one app on my phone."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"superb aap for multiple work...thanks for aap devloper..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Originally a solid image editing app, now added ai. It still works as an editor but asks for permission to send notifications every single time you open the app and advertises its ai features everywhere. If you're just interested in the image editing like I was, there's better apps out there."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years, it's awesome."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app was fine, but then it began supporting using AI to touch up images. I cannot in good faith support that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love awesome app i love the editing 😸? 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"this was great app before the upgrade. id been using it frequently over the past 5 years!!. great filters and double exposure features..but after accidental deletion to free up space..its now incompatible with the same phone when l attempt to reinstall from google playstore on the same phone!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it is very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"You should've made the icon compatible with material you design, instead of putting AI in the name, really not Worth riding the wave."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"too many ads now. (Edit to your response) I understand you need to fund the application, but having a fifteen second ad at the time of export is ridiculous."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app for editing photos and making collages. Lot of good tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Upon saving a picture it degrades the resolution. This is especially evident when you utilize the double exposure feature by adding another photo with text. It has gotten increasingly glitchy lately as well, and the ads have gotten more intrusive and annoying. Currently looking for another option. It was great for years, but not any longer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It has been a long journey Pixlr, years have passed by and you are one of my first choices to go to whenever I wanna have an accurate editing tool, before I got my laptop, Pixlr was the app I design my wallpaper and degitalise my drawings with. much love to the developers of this app. 🤍"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing photo picture editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: they're fully pivoted to AI now, to the point it's obtrusive to other features. Time to uninstall. Used to be a serviceable app. The ads are so intrusive at this point though that when you get one, no matter what you do, your phone is taken over for at least 30 seconds, and when you go to click the microscopic little x to exit it, it forced you into the app store to the download page, usually at least twice. Completely unusable and plays sounds from ads even when not in app."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years and it's awesome. the zoom allows you fix things on a smaller scale so you don't wind up with the eye sore edit. the free version is barely limited.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very very good app for photoshop works.. Thank you.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"as of a year ago: great app, gave me everything i could ever want from an image editor. now it's AI, every time you go to the homescreen it begs you to buy AI credits so that you can generate images. i don't want to generate images. if i wanted a generative AI, a thousand other places will do it for free (fb, samsung, chatgpt, midjourney), so I'm surely not going to pay you for it. it still functions as an image editor, but the AI stuff is more intrusive than the ads ever were, i hate it."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"best ever iv used for many years number 1 for me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Devs: You're not fooling me. Your ads & subs are paying for the fake reviews to inflate 5* ratings. | Now they support AI trash. You can't use this app when offline unless you pay, which is greedy. The devs continually claim ""this helps us fund the app,"" yet try to force you into premium with intrusive popup ads for known scam cash earning apps. They already have ad banners, but insist on pushing even more trashy ads. It's finally gotten to a point where I'm dropping this app."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ok, let me preface this review by letting everyone know that I *never* write reviews but with the recent changes Pixlr has made with their app, I really need to express how utterly disappointed I am. Pixlr has always been my go-to for making all the art I've created and provided amazing SIMPLE tools. I opened the app today to work on something and...what? AI. Overpriced subscription plans. A horrifically confusing layout. I get wanting to jump on the AI train and all but not all of us do"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow. This used to be one of THE BEST photo apps. What happened?? Because $60 for filters (for those of us who liked Pixlr before and have ZERO interest in AI) is crazy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love this app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When i want to save an image, which looks really good after a retouch, there's an error ""java.lang.Nullpointerexception"", and all the work I've done is lost. Congratulations to the person that's responsible for not fixing such obvious issue!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best software available. Used it before it was cool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"works well, but I admit, I'm using ad blocking. Cool effects & filters and general image manipulation. It's definitely not like Photoshop, but I don't use that anyway."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Okay I almost let you guys get away with the 1.9 million individual data/passwords get breached and released onto a free forum in 2020 (including my own)... Then the audacity to make a pricey subscription for very basic editing software is crazy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All the edit buttons on the bottom of the screen are all jumbled up. Editing a photo it now impossible. The app is useless!!!! UNINSTALLED!!!!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editor! By far, the best."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Neat and easy to use; only wisb the text editor had an outline option. edit 2024/10/04: really dislike the AI ad that pops up every time you open the app, and now realized I can't use it without internet connection (prob bc it can't load the ad); it's kind of gross to see such blatant cashgrab with AI hype, which is a bubble that's soon to burst, but i digress... please remove the ad and allow the app to run offline"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was useful to make quick edits. AI features are not useful. Will be deleting promptly."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved this app and have used it constantly but I opened it today to see out of nowhere it's now a paid app. Yeah, no."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"not saving any edited photos in Android I don't care what they say it's not saving edited images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years now and I've loved it. Until I tried using it a couple days ago, and since haven't been able to open it. I tried everything, unistalled, cleared the data... and it just... Won't work. Bummed. Edit after a few years. Tried it again and now it is a completely different app. And even more in a worse way. Bring back old Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr *used to be* an excellent, bulletproof app. Crashes all the time now.. crashes consistently,and suddenly after I installed the last update. Now it doesn't open at all, even after a re-install. Way to go, developers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfection, thank you so much developers, THIS IS THE FIRST APP NOT GETTING WORSE WITH UPDATES BUT BETTER. In 2024. In this economy. Not all heroes wear capes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app has always been my fav. The recent AI driven approach is nkt good. There are plenty of alternatives lit there for AI. Please, revert to ""normal"". Plus, it will be highly appeciated to have an option to buy premium features not via subscription, but via one time purchase."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This whole AI overhaul took an amazing app and made it slow, buggy, and awful. It feels like corporate run spyware now. Install an old version and never let it update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"All good things come to an end. I used this app for years to put a final piece of art together with parts from other apps as it would integrate them flawlessly. While AI is cool it's not something I would use so it has no value to me. I already paid for its extras a few years ago and now I get comercials, constant interruptions to upgrade and limited functionality. To shell out additional money on a monthly basis is not worth it to me. Paint shop pro on my PC works fine."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pathetic attempt to force us to use constant Internet to open the app, Also jumped on the ""AI"" band wagon didn't you?! If the Internet is turned on but not allowed for this app it won't work. I'm downgrading to the previous version which didn't force me to login or use internet!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"lacks basic image editing features like copy/cut/paste; had to switch to my PC to get the job done."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this app because websites recommend it as one of the best (and only) android apps for editing RAW format images. Maybe it was, one time, now it's an instagram filter wannabe for AI bros. It doesn't even recognise RAW files."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This app has been a FREE 5star plus photo editor for 7-8 years. However GREED HAS CONSUMED THEM and they inserted an AI MONIKER PREFIX ON SOME OF THE SAME OLD FEATURE NAMES AND DENY YOU ANY ACCESS TO EVEN THE BASIC EDITOR BY SHOVING A 7 DAY FREE TRIAL SCREEN BLOCKER IN YOUR FACE REPEATEDLY UNLESS YOU SUBMIT TO A 7 DAY TRIAL for exactly the same functions that were FREE FOR OVER 7 YEARS. They only tagged them with the SILLY AI PREFIX. *NEWS*FLASH* IT IS OLD-WORN STUFF NOT AI! Grow Up! bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to be my go-to app for basic photo edits. now it tries to force users to pay for a subscription and shoves ai features in your face. no longer worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using this for a few years and unfortunately the latest UI upgrade is really bad in design along with the money grab for the use of AI tools that yes you can avoid using but seriously just stop making money grab on every area on the app. Used to be my go to and one I would recommend now it's become the avoid and soon to be removed. Shame."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for editing all kinds of stuff. Definitely one of my favorites 👑"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I miss the old ui. This used to be my favorite app for editing and was the best free photo app I've used and even considered paying for premium.. not anymore ): the new update is really really bad. I'm sorry for 1 star, I hope u guys can fix it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hate the new AI update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This has AI now? That's an uninstall for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The app decreases the quality of the photos as soon as I load them to edit."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Latest finding : the'Light' Overlay Effect cannot be fully downloaded hence unusable. Otherwise, very easy to use, simple & depends how creative you can be. Very useful for quick & simple projects."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for so many years... bought ALL of the filters and effects. Since the update, I am not able to access my account, and am not able to reset my password. I've contacted the developers, we'll see if they respond."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Another nice and simple app ruined with a disasterous UI and so-called ""AI"" infection. Well, pity, after many many years uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It no longer starts without network access permission. Downgraded to 3.5.9"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be free. Not anymore. Use PicsArt until that one isnt free either."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's ok. I wanted to use a stretch effect but it doesn't have that. So I deleted it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Really useful, easy to use... at least that used to be the case years ago. Now they've changed the format, put a monthly charge on it, and also have an AI update that causes it to be unusable if you don't have Internet access. Thanks a whole lot, pixlr. Edit: my hopes are low, guy who replied."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be a very good app. Latest update added a bunch of bloat and slapped the AI label front and center to let us all know they've jumped the shark Edit: no, I didn't encounter difficulty. The app looks ugly now and seeing the word AI at all immediately makes me want to use an app tenfold less."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and it was ok, recently updated and now it's pushing AI junk + subscriptions, nothing will save, super annoying popups all the time. Bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As an artist myself, take your AI update and shove it.. you know the rest. This was a good app before joining the bandwagon. We want tools, not toys."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Missing my favorite effects"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This new AI update is beyond terrible. The updated look and feel makes it worse to use. And the starting screen, I mean advertisement, does it HAVE to pop up every single time I open the app? I said no 20 times, it's not going to turn into a yes so stop asking me. Time to start looking for a new editing app after all these years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app has good features, but when I saved a cropped image it significantly lowered the quality. Also, it is a big disappointment (and an extremely jarring change) that an app that used to cost like either $1.99 or $7.99 (can't remember) for a lifetime subscription now doesn't even have a lifetime subscription and the yearly subscription costs *many* multiples more than that, at $59.99. Who can afford that?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened? The app just opens to this new splash title page and just sits there. Reinstalled several times and restarted the device as well and still just this new startup screen with nothing. I would have given it 4 or five stars but then this happened. Forced to give it a 0. If I can't use it,not worth it.🤷"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and it's been incredible. This new update absolutely broke it in so many ways rendering it nearly unusable. So disappointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using the original version for years .. I'd love to have it as an option to use the old one instead please !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Everything is a paywall. It was a better company years ago. Totally corrupted by the desperation for endless profits. Really not worth the effort unless you are willing to spend a bunch of money monthly for multiple subscriptions to access everything here."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cash grab. Congrats on your AI tools. You took away the premium overlays that I already paid for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't even open anything! So frustrating!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Take your meaningless 'AI' buzzword and shove it. Gone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using Pixlr regularly for about 10 years now. While I noted some decline in quality since Autodesk sold the app to this new company, it's still the best editing app I've come across, and is still my go-to photo editor. I'll be honest, I was worried about major changes as soon as I saw the AI update. But thankfully, the old features remain the same, only with a fresher look. Please, never change those original features!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, they've added a bunch of AI garbage and a subscription fee. I don't trust any company using AI not to steal my intellectual property. Will not be using any more."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I previously purchased this app, it *was* great for quickly editing photos of my work before posting on socials. Now you've gone and erased my previous purchase and my email. This just isn't fair to long time users."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You guys just lost me. To go from having everything, to having to pay for the app is a kick in the nuts. You can keep your app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Fein Fein Fein Fein Fein number"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"There is a bug with the Text option. It won't allow me to resize the Text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to really love this app before the update. I used it for all my creative needs. Now it's almost useless to me. It won't let me crop or color correct. I have no need for the AI templates or cutesy add ons. Please consider putting it back to the way it was."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"preferred the old version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I liked it wayy more before the UI redesign, now it looks like any other average photo editor and lacks it's previous charm. Functionality still the same 👍 But lost 2 stars from me because of the bad UI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"one of the best editor I have used..❤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the best photo editing app for android, I am using it for over a decade and it's still best app I can find, it's sad that there is no option to purchase ads free version separately from subscriptions, but from functionality standpoint, all important features are free and ads are not on every corner so i can get over that, over all very good experience."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"If somebody wants to sit there and actually edit a photo, they be better off using the browser version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The AI is fine but the only update that was really needed is the ability to edit text after placing it in the photo. I've been using this app for like 8 years, just sucked to watch it change."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updated to be hot garbage that wants to shove generative AI down your throat. The main functions of the app don't actually seem to work anymore either. I paid for this a couple years ago. I will be manually downgrading back to a version that doesn't include generative AI, and I won't be giving them another penny. It's an ethics issue, and if they want to incorporate generative AI they can absolutely shove it up their collective rears. Unacceptable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Get rid of AI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Revised review: The recent update just destroyed the app! Won't be using it anymore ✌🏼🙄 What a shame....... WAS, One of the best editing apps out there!! I've tried so many and this is by far #1 I've come across!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's the only app I know which allows me to brighten or darken a portion of the screen/photo as opposed to the whole thing. As such it's invaluable. Recently, I stumbled upon double exposure. I had no idea what it did but I learned that it allows us to put two photos together very, very well. I'm impressed with that. It doesn't do a lot of things but the things that it does do it does well"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I thought this app was done with the glitching, I've had a problem with editing photos on it and after updating it again a few minutes ago, I still can't use double exposure and other tools. This is the only app I rely on for photo related matters, but it never stops disappointing every few months"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I being using this app for years but they recently add ""AI garbage"" and now you have to pay to use it. Bad move."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This WAS a great app, I used it all the time for the features it had. Now, it's absolutely useless. Can't do any of the things I loved to do. I think it's time to stop paying for this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used pixler for over 10 years and I used to love it until I started finding other apps they did a lot more because picture refuses to upgrade their app they have the same features that they did 10 years ago and have added nothing to it. It's the same as it was 10 years ago."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After all of these years, using this app for making my memes and custom artwork, you idiots change the app around. Unintalled. Bye Felicia!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update may be the worst update I've ever seen for an app. The User Interface is a downgrade by a billion years so much so I may need to find a new app. AI is bad too but regardless of that, the AI aspect should've been a seperate, original app. This is just awful! Wish I could rate 0 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"After updating app.. pixlr not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"How sad.... I've been using this for years and I loved it but now they're doing the silly yearly plan weekly and monthly plans for a crazy amount of cash.... $59.99 for a full year... this is insanity or even $3.69 weekly that's crazy too that's more than Netflix monthly.... I can understand making a little money but this is ridiculous. Uninstalling and finding a new program now how disappointing. I would purchase it for a lifetime plan one time payment but not weekly monthly or yearly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"We putting text on an image you CANNOT zoom in on the image while doing so, neither can you when placing and overlay on the image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've loved the app and used it pretty consistently for 6+ months... I REALLY wish it would stop changing 😭 and I'm disappointed by the latest update. I'm not interested in AI content at all, which it's now really pushing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I Don't Like The Changes That Were Made To The App I Had Pixlr For A Very Long Time & I Loved It Not Anymore I've Uninstalled It I Won't Use It Anymore I Don't Trust It"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I thought it can do aging/deaging filter using ai tools. But it can't and results were terrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Turned my favorite app into an unusable mess in service of ""AI"" nonsense. Find a better alternative."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used and loved this app for years but NOBODY WANTS AI FEATURES"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The new update sucks. It opens in AI mode or some stupid cr*p, and the only way to get a real menu up is to disconnect from the internet. You went from 5 stars to 1 star, and only bcuz I couldn't pick none!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to work. now it doesn't"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You need to fix the bug or refund everyone who can't use the app despite paying for the service. Yes we know it is ""a bug between the mobile app and version"" because you're replying that to every single review. You're the devs, it's your job to fix the bug, especially because you have dishonestly reported to the distributor which devices and android versions the app works on. Fix it, roll back the update, or give refunds so people can buy some other software that actually works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The new ai part doesn't work at all. And the adjustment part of the app is a bit laggy. Disappointed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Bugs fixed, I reinstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hlw, Dear Pixlr I used this app in 2014-17 without any update of this app. Last some of the year i did not use, but recently i again installed this app but it made me disappointed cause Its owners have not come up with anything new.authority should Come up with new futures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It doesn't allow you to make a collage with an entire photo it'll cut it out so if you want to see your workout progress you can't because it'll cut off most of the photo. It also still has ads even if I pay for the premium service. I'm looking for an other photo editor app and I'm probably going to cancel my subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It literally just stopped working. Won't even open pictures, just crashes every single time. I used it maybe 5 days before this issue. No problem. I hate modern technology. None of you are reliable and you want money for it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My data was breached because of this app. No, thank you. I used to think that this was a really good app for editing photos, but clearly, you can't trust them. I wouldn't download if I were you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't belive what this has become over time. I had rated this app 4* back in 2015 but I'm forced to update it to 1* today. Most of the features in the app are either broken or paid and I wasn't even able to save the picture. I doubt what purpose this app serves now. Improvement in the stock camera apps of phones and AI have significantly reduced dependence on photo editing apps these days, but it doesn't mean game over. Unique features are still gonna keep your app relevant for years to come."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Dont download this. The features are very outeded."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent apo 👍🏻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Good App for Editing Photos. I really loved it ever since I started to use it. User interface is also good and simple yet gave creative options to edit images..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I miss old Pixar app with lot of feature Current app looks like mature and basic app . Old was amazing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Yes, please add more features, Pixlr ... EXCEPT FOR AI !! Don't want or need AI on my device or this photo editor. AI makes everything look fake. I will uninstall Pixlr Photo Editor if AI is added."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love this app but today I received an in app message that promised new features that included ai. PLEASE don't add ai. Real artists don't need or want ai in their software."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The only thing I cannot stand about this app, is that if you are working on a little art project and you just switch screens for not even a minute and return, all that work is gone. You're back to the main menu. After a second attempt, I was saving it to a folder, it did not save. It took me back to the main menu after choosing a located save folder. Again, all that work gone. It did not save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Another photo app with fewer editing options than your phone's preloaded camera app and ugly generative AI ""features"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"12 Red Flagged Trackers and 8 of them are Advertisements!!! No Thanks!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for years! The absolute best one out there!! Highly recommend!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Frames are the best available !! Extremely high quality app. Professional. I do photoshop and this app is sophisticated.. Fun!! Should be much much higher rated!! Again Has fabulous frames. Bought it!! . I make videos daily and have 10 video apps.. This one is one of the best (My favorite. Surprised by the unfair reviews. Really unfair.. Silly people. This is a GREAT APP. 😭. After every opening.. Ugh. Has features that most apps do not have."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"👇👎💩🤡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for years and it's easy and fun!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is in my every device."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Five stars from me I love this app specialy we can write texts on images it's osm I don't have words to appreciate the hard work of QA department and the most respected developers it's such a comparative application n we don't have to watch so many adds thx for this amazing application *REGARDS* *QURAT*"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good but needs more features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Used this to make high quality memes for years. Came back to it recently and it is missing things such as templates of basic shapes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Low rating b/c various Pixlr software is confusingly similarly named. Apparently I actually wanted ""Pixlr Editor."" The titlebar of that website says ""Photo Editor Pixlr."" Apparently it doesn't exist for mobile and the web version isn't screen size responsive enough to be usable. Would have thought mobile image editing software would have layers by now. Without being able to edit individual layers, I'm not interested. Might as well just use any of the dozens of apps with filters built in."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have the desktop app and it's paid for, I see no ability to Carry that membership into this app... Without it, this app is useless with all the ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I never update an app ever until I read positive reviews about the update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Shall i can change my outfit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can not save my photos to gallery"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've just wasted ages of my time creating an image and it won't save to my gallery, this is so desperately frustrating"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its been on my phone, and the two phones before this one. Its the first thing I do."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and really liked it. Fast, efficient photo editing which makes posting pictures while out and about easy. Suddenly, the app refuses to save the edited image making the entire app useless. I've tried various ways to solve the problem but now on the verge of giving up and uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Been using this app for years with no problems, in the last week it won't save to gallery anymore, please fix/help"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow! What a steller app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dookie"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I only downloaded the good ones. And this is it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I seriously have zero idea why anyone would use this app. I opened a picture from my phone and there was literally FIVE tools to use. There wasn't even an eraser tool, just crop!! My stock photo app does so much more than this heaping pile of garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One of the worst photo editing apps I've ever used, period. This app is so overwhelmingly finicky and annoying, I found myself nearly throwing a tantrum just trying to move a few images. The online, PC/Laptop version is not any better, infact I'd argue it's even worse. When moving a few images in parallel (linking them) some will move and others won't, and yes, they are linked together. That is one of the dozen bugs I've found using this godawful software, too bad theres a review limit here..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It has a few nice effects but there's no real photo editing. Kind of useless unless you really like one of the few effects and want a quick result. 1.5 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"No ads = very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Just did not comply with what I want in a phot editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Occasionally, randomly unable to save images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After the recent update this app not working properly. I can't save my works. Even though it's says that ""your picture saved to gallery"" there's nothing saved. Plz make this work again like before."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. I have to update my review and say, PATHETIC. I have been using Pixlr for almost a decade now. Irrespective of whether free or paid, it used to be one of my favourite apps. But this time, even being a paid user, I am facing so many issues with ""DOWNLOADING"" the effects that I want to use and there is NO HELP to rectify that. I think it's time to finally remove the app and move on to others!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"AWESOME APP! EASY TO USE!! I use it EVERY day for my editing ideas via texts or comments on pages!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good application."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Apparently cannot preserve EXIF data on edited image. A reject app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm not g*y"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the third image editor I have tried. I just need select and cut/paste. How is such a basic feature so elusive? Even MS Paint can do it To the developer response: No, I won't be doing that. I found a much more simple free and open source editor that has this very basic function. It is NOT a 'professional feature' like you claim. Your app is just lacking very fundamental functionality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"AI trash"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Vip photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this is one of the rare apps I personally wanted to rate cause of how good it is. Thanks!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app frequently to repair old photos and it is easy and the finished product is beautiful! Some of my older relatives will send me copies of pictures they have scanned but they are wrinkled, smeared or spotted. I just fix them for them. It's easy and fun and they want to know I how I did it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Gandu aap i don't like it. Toooooo boring. Iluv picart. Don't download this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BUY! It does not work well. Faces are unrecognizable as human and specific words are misspelled. I am also going back and forth with support bc they do not understand the issue. Do not buy! THEY WILL FIGHT YOU TOOTH AND NAIL FOR A REFUND!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Have been a frequent user of this app, but unable to set this as the default editor app of late. Tried out all the setting options and fix tips available in Google, but no luck. Is there any way out there?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Execellent app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"it is good editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'd love this app it's now been 6 to 7 , and I'm using it. I wish the makers created a video editing tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"crashes constantly. used to be a pretty decent photo app but now im going to have to find another one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I use this app daily. Suddenly, when I apply a text to a picture, I'm no longer able to apply a color to the text. Deeply saddened."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful I have never been so successful with my videos on YouTube it's just Woah Like it's something I have always wanted and I still might be under eighteen I don't care this app is more than most the apps I have came across and it is just so much and hard since I edited myself before but now with this app It's so easy less editing it gives me more time the draw my animations, not just sit around day, night, day in a constant cycle of editing so Thx for your help Pixlr ❤️🦋🪷❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app works GREAT on my tablet, which is an older model (2017 I think) and has no problems whatsoever, however, on my new phone, the app is completely trashed. No matter how I save an image, it's more pixilated than a 1990s jpeg meme file, making it a useless editing app for what I'm trying to do on my phone. 2 stars for supporting an older device, but not for newer devices. EDIT: It was the latest version, as in, I'd literally JUST installed it on my phone, and it didn't work right."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Edit: To Pixlr's reply. I don't have to do anything. I paid for this software and changed nothing on my phone, and if your current version is not working with new Android updates, then YOU need to patch it. But as of now, I've got no loyalty or time left for you. - - Original Post: Same issue as everyone else. Loved Pixlr for a long time and then suddenly I can't save any projects and lost tons of time I've spent working on them. I guess it's time just move on and just get a new go-to program."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Jcool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Been using it for years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for a long time it works well and suits my photo needs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I USED to love this app; but since the last update, fonts are missing, the only colors for fonts that show up are black & white... why???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It makes everything blurry now. Unusable now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad photo cropping, Bad quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is amazing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best mobile photo editing app I've used. Love it on my laptop & desktop, too."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app 👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Very bad application.. Image quality ruined after editing.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love the images it helps me create 😁"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When saving a photo which was retouched using the heal function, the portion where you used heal turns grey"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I was happy with this app until I opened it today to find AI integrations on the homescreen. I'm uninstalling immediately. I'm also a little confused/concerned how any changes could show on the app, when I don't allow automatic updates. It's fine as a free app - some learning curve and adding text is awkward - but passable if you don't care about ruining the environment and people's creative content with AI."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app been using it for years very minimal and professional interface very straight forward editing tool good job!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Love this app but now there's a bug, as of 5/29/24. I try to open the app and it just immediately closes it. My phone then alerts me there's a bug in Pixlr and I should put it in deep sleep. I cleared the cache, then cleared data. Didn't work. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled, but that didn't work either. This is an app I use all the time! Help!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"the longer you spend editing an image, the less likely it is to save; sure you can share the file to a different app ... if you are ok with a 60% drop in resolution. what a waste of time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this editor for many years. This is the best user-friendly mobile photoshop. Large amount of filters, stickers, text styles, frames etc. You'll find it in here. My favourite tool is placing one image over another, and there's just no better app to do this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cant do something as simple as erase tf dont bother"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: And STILL no response! ...I checked my 'Purchased Apps' app, and my Google email receipts, and I come away wondering, how much have you developers STOLEN from other users that PAID for features prior to your money grab??? Apparently my premium LIFETIME PURCHASE is NO LONGER a LIFETIME PURCHASE. What a crock. Nevermind we supporters, just dig the shiv into the bone like it's a new celly, right? Now I can't even get the overlays I PAID FOR, what a bunch of criminals these developers are!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"My pixir app is not working properly it wont let me in to some of the features evon thoe i have paied for this. It wont let me use the bokeh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good range of effects, but can't resize photos or put them on a square or standard-sized background suitable for Instagram"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app does exactly what I need it to and does it well! I have been using Pixlr for many years."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Keep on receiving the ""error downloading light pack"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until I realized you support genAI and you steal data for the assets and models."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"UNABLE TO INSTALL UPDATES!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love this app I've been using it for years now.. Any time I've needed something edited in some photos, I always end up coming back here, because somehow this app is the only one that's been able to help with the specific things I've needed to do, and even without the paid version there's still plenty to work with and I think it's worth it. I gave it 4 stars only because it used to be completely free then when they finally added some cool new stuff, that's when they wanted to put up a pay wall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"No suitable to me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No way to choose font size makes adding text impossible. Chosing save folder eliminates ability to view all images. No obvious way to lower resolution."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sometimes editing are not saved. Working for a long behind any pic and when trying to save the pic after work is done, it shows that the file cannot be saved because of Java.lang.NullPointerException error. It's pathetic. Try to get it in order"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"read the ""privacy policy"" is not private at all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Everything is perfect in this app the things which I needed are there and except those everything is there which unexpected very good quality of collage and everything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ive used this photo editor for about 10 years now, i spent countless hours trying to find a good photo editor and this one is the best. I dont think ill ever use another app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this for basic edits & watermarking Default file name needs to be a date and time stamp tho plz Custumizable is ideal, but I should never see a million zeros in an exported filename. This should be standard on every type of imaging software, and was once upon a time, but at minimum the year and day need to be there please I love this program and want to upgrade, but having to manually rename my files, even with a batch editor, from generated digit counts is getting really frustrating"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using it for about 7 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What is the point of being able to edit your photos and save them when the app fails to save the image with the edits applied? Edits will appear ok in the app and will seem to save the new images fine...until you view your newly saved edit and notice Pixlr saved your photo without the edits. Useless. This has been an ongoing issue for months that dev doesn't seem interested in fixing. Used to be intermittent issue, now its all the time. Will be looking for an alt to Pixlr now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"one of the best app i have tried, photo editing features and interface is spot on, i like the drag and drop features and the zoom when you pinch in or out, the saved fonts and other preferences sometimes fails during dev mode, but over all good app and nice user experience, kudos to creators, definitely worth to try app and worth to recommend it with friends, keep it up"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't believe how bad this over hyped app is"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the sharpen effect)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I really love ur app already use 3 years or more than that... We don't need to pay money and can use (heal ) setting soo easily.. i have a opinion about ur app after editing can photo generated (save) same size as normal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened to collage editing? I can pick the layout, edit photos, but can't swap photos. I.e., move photos around. Sucks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Can't Save Edited Pictures Anymore When I try I get an error message stating: failed to save file java.lang.nullpointerexception"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years and it's one of the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use Pixlr to edit photos. Pixlr is very useful and good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"If you heal an area and then save the picture, the saved picture in the gallery has blue tint in the area that you healed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. the go to app for editing photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Today when I try to open this app, it takes me to my Facebook account instead. Odd. 5 times so far."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"حرف نداره"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Always good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Problems with saving, something something null ptr java exception or whatever. Reinstall worked for it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cracking app but now doesnt open and says there is a bug (s10 plus)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"First tried this app in 2019 and didn't like it.. Tried again today in 2024 and it's still not a good app.. There's plenty of much 6etter editing apps to use.. This one is LAME.!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've got a charge coming out even after canceling subscription so my bank account is going to go negative and keep going negative because I was told I can't get a refund even though I had canceled it. Free trial isn't worth it if you can't cancel it...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this except I don't know where it's saving my files, I have to screenshot and edit. They used to save to gallery but quit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Almost none of the functionality of the website. It's exactly the same as every other mobile app photo editor: tacky, simple, and oversimplified for no reason. The website is superior even though it's terribly difficult to use on a mobile device."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice 💯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Μπερδεύεται ξαφνικά, κλείνει και χάνεις ότι έχεις κάνει μέχρι τότε. Άρα έχασες το χρόνο σου με μια εφαρμογή που δεν είναι σταθερη"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I use this app often & have for years but there has been no updated seasonal or new stickers that I've seen now for a few years... disappointing.. Update: there used to be additional stickers when you purchased Premium... like Christmas ones etc.. but nothing new in years even when you get Premium.. why???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"App crashes a lot on me recently, I've been trying to put multiple pictures together and do cool edits, but I'll lose all my work when suddenly it decides to go back to the homescreen and not save my work... otherwise it's a really good app, I've used it for years... but that crashing issue really irks me"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It is not saving my edits"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent, I've been using it for over 5 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice program overall. I dont get why rotation also does zoom. Also there's no trapezoid adjust/transform. I found the app by looking for one with a levels filter, not the same but it works. I would hate to see good features being paywalled like in other apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for yeeeears but one of the recent updates took away my favorite font. It was the first one in the Retro font section. I'm pretty sure it's called Airstream but yeah, cool app. I would like it if the devs were able to bring that font back, I've resorted to downloading the app on an old phone which takes time from what I want to edit."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"all I wanted was an app that I could edit memes with (aka draw on an image and put text on it) and this one does it wonderfully so far!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very poor App it does not fix anything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editor with the most useful tools. It has the thing for you to do the thing you find yourself in need of most frequently, from a rare occurrence perspective. Other editors promise saving of files with no watermark that says derogatory things to me and deletes my email but they fail to stop it from happening, and here we are 10 years later, file folders full of watermarked foul language all over pictures of my kids and BOOM my email gets deleted. Pixlr is best, 9/10 - lose that Temu ad 😉"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I pay for pixlr yet there's no way to sign in with my account from online. Poor app. Worst of its kind because of this basic thing that should be standard. Love Pixlr, hate this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"still ok and relevan"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Earliee version was better. Not able to add photo in photo"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app, just wish it had borders for fonts, plus a Larger variety of fonts, maybe able to add fonts? And maybe a removal tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS APP FOR YEARS AND IT WAS GREAT, ONLY RECENTLY IT SEEMS I AM NOT ABLE TO SAVE IN HIGH DEFINITION / HIGH RESOLUTION ANYMORE..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Is there a liquefy/warp brush setting I'm not seeing, or is it not in this app?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This aap downgrade your image quality when you edit on this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's easy to use with great results!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing for blemish removal and more. The only thing is holy hell please add an undo button when editing like during blurring or heal. One accidental click and I have to restart"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Here Daven! This account. I am asking for my subscription details for this account."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Will update full review after use of it. Two star populararity and 50M downloads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Broken again! Photos import sideways again and distort when rotated. Time to find a new app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best App for Artists...This App has Great Features..Very Helpful!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too much restrictions for free user, even free emoji sticker needs paid version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great editing app.I love the healing feature."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Website is better IMO. I can't remove background using AI and save as WebP."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After saving the picture sometimes it becomes pixelated. Shading tool still does not work correctly, it makes it way too white. Also, a new bug in the app prevents you from going back into it after you saved your picture. Using heal tool now shows picture as grey."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's amazing, I have been using it for more than 10 years on different phones."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Disappointed with this app. I have been using it for a long time. Since changing my phone I found that the first 10 templates are missing. What happened to it? Please put it back. I have reduced your star rating just because of that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hi. I've used this app for 10 years. It's my favorite for all my picture editing for my business. In the last couple weeks, I haven't been able to save any pics after editing. I keep getting a 'javalang.exception'? I sent you a message and never heard back. Please tell me what that is. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Just an excellent app with great and useful features. Love the smoothing feature. Thank you developers of this app, please don't change too much!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr is the best photo editor for me. Been using it for a long time with pleasure. But now there is a problem when trying to save the photo. A text called Java null is coming. For which I contacted pixlr authorities but didn't get good results. Now what can I do?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great appz"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I use this app in tandem with my snapseed app for desired applications for my digital art templates. Still exploring it's possibilities, fun app to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for many years for many different things but the one down side is there is not a lot of font options and currently there seems to be an issue with the retro font option where many of the fonts are the exact same. I really wish there were more font options."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"For several years my go to editor. Mostly to make a simple background from a picture qith some text on my phone. Or for a funny invitation for a birthday. But for a while now, there are fewer text/fonts options than before, why???"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app very much.It is very useful for my school work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"For a 32yr old mom, it works well enough for me, or used to at least. Lately, any text added to any picture becomes blurry as hell as soon as it's done and it's beyond frustrating!! So I'm forced to find another app to edit photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been loyal to this app for almost 10 years now. I use it for so many different photo editing purposes, I love the ease of use and consistency of the filters. My only reason for a 3 star review is home many times this app has crashed on me in the final stages of a deep edit. I'm stubborn, I like to stick with a company I know but it is so incredibly crushing to be so deep into an important project just to suddenly lose it all with nothing more I can do but start over."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I really like this app it's great for editing,"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years now. It's one of the best editing apps put there. Almost no ads to deal with, it only after you're completely done editing does an ad appear. Highly recommend for editing pictures and photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app, however recently found the saved images are no longer using the filename of the original file I opened, which was in timestamp format. This has made it very difficult for my post processing steps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Muchas imágenes no se pueden guardar por un error."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really good and helpful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a long time, and I enjoy creating different pictures. I love the way the moon photo turns out after I use one of my favorite apps, and I have downloaded this app into all my phones, and I will try to share 1 of my pictures. If not, sorry. I am still using this app, and it is 2024.. January"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my go to app for my photo art. I did have bug issues from time to time, sadly, now, I can rarely save my work, it will randomly shut off and it also will freeze from time to time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All the Photo editor apps in Google Play are no good. If they are paid or filled with advertising or others, the edited images cannot be downloaded as in this app here . I have uninstalled this Pixlr photo Editor again"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now after spending hours editing photographs won't save and closes out back to original image. Very infuriating when spending that much time and work on a project then it just disappears."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great, simple little app that I use frequently for cropping photos, adding text and marking them with hand drawn lines, etc."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best apps i still using when it create to now"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good 💯 very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great for years but currently has an ad that hides the SAVE button, useless app if you can't save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Use it constantly. Great app. Please make an ad free premium version without subscription. A one time fee. 29.99 would be perfect."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Splash is not working. I stopped using this app because of this problem so I waited for an update but still every time I'm using splash it's not applying to my photos after I save it."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This has been my go to app for editing pictures for years, in the past I have given 5 stars...but all of a sudden, when I open my gallery and hit the edit button , the Pixlr icon no longer comes up as an option. The only way I can edit now is to launch the app and choose a picture. Cannot find how to rectify this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app started to save the unmodified pictures instead of the modified ones."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What's happening? Why can't double exposure? Please fix it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's a good photo editing app, but if you pay for Pixlr Plus online you can't use that account with the mobile version. It's like they're running 2 different apps with the same name."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Previously 5 stars for the paid app, but when I got my new phone and did a smart switch, I lost a lot of fonts including the font I use for my business logo and product labels. Over 20 fonts defaulted to my phone's font. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, which does not work. Update: I spoke with Daven thru emails. Was instructed the issue would be forwarded to another dept. Still no fonts or word back. Update: UNINSTALLED"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Add 4:5 crop option for Instagram."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I use this app fairly often and have had a lot of success with it. HOWEVER, recently I've been using it to edit PNG images that don't have a background. But when I go to save the image, pixlr adds a black background instead of keeping it transparent. As far as I know, there is no way around this and it's very frustrating"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app very much! I screenshot my finished photo just in case it doesn't save it. There are no photo editors that work quite like this one and I have tried many!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have to use this app for years and it seems to satisfy my photo editing needs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved this app so so much, I always used it for my photography. But now it refuses to save my pictures and always shows the javanullpointerexception mistake. I saw many complaints like this here, so please stop telling that it's the device issue. Please fix this problem. Until then, i deleted the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"**Update** I am reaching out to you Pixlr... Unfortunately I had to take away 2 stars, hopefully temporarily. In the last couple of years my edited pics suddenly had been stored in a file it took me a week and a great deal of online research to find. Well, once again, with latest update I can not find my pics. This time it appears they are not saving at all even though it says they are, as I have checked every single file. Pixlr... HELP!!!!!! ~ e novo. 12-10-23 Love this app!!! Easy and fun!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage. You seriously removed the ability to color stuff in general on the main site, forcing me to get your app, and you don't have a fill in tool? Why take away HELPFUL tools? Who wants to sit down and paint stuff by hand? Don't waist your time with this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Why can't I download my photo?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save image...fix this bug or i will uninstall after doing many editing its unable to save image🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sometimes this app stuck at 50% when saving After 30 minutes editing and stuck at saving deserve a 1 star"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be the best... USED TO BE Now its just like the rest of the trash apps floating around"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be my favorite edit app but I can't save images anymore. Even updated it and still can't save edits. Pixlr, this is a huge issue and it looks like others are having this issue too."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Double exposure not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Suggestion : An Anti-crop. Sometimes I want to add dimensions to a photo. Extra on the edges (And from there make other adjustments). And there doesn't seem to be a way to do so."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"reliable, easy to use, responsive."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app shouldn't be described as a photo editor. It can't open a photo from a gallery app's ""Edit"" operation, unlike every other photo editor. It's more like a photo management suite that includes an editor (but will not function as a standalone photo editor)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good enough used application thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Usually I would rate it 5, but I have persistent problem with double exposure option lately. It just refuses to work most of the time. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it didn't help."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Required more functions and fonts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's easy to use and has great results. As other reviews say there are ads but on my app there is just a bar ad at the top of the screen which doesn't really effect editing (it can be a bit annoying because it does slightly overlap your photo when it's zoomed in but it's fine) and a video add when you save your photo, which isn't a big deal to me. It's free. The recent update made a new folder on my photos which is annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Currently unusable, when i tap on the photo button to pick one to edit, nothing happens. Long tap or holding down on it does nothing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This has been my go-to photo editor app for the longest time, all the way back when it was owned by Autodesk way back in the beginning in 2012. Proud to say that I've been with you for over a decade and you are still the best in my book 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and I would give it a 5, but lately it's been crashing regularly without saving the finished product... and it has been saving those which actually download in a much much lower resolution (Before it would save about 6 to 8 Meg's versus the .750 to 1.000 Meg version it's saving now with highest resolution settings available). They say it may be a version clash... It's possible. Will rate higher once situation is rectified."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't Save Large Photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"TOP PHOTO EDITING APP FOR ANDROID, Best of the best, Thanks for this outstanding app for free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for years but now sometimes it won't let me save images, it gives me the text ""failed to save file, java.lang.NullPointerException"" I have no idea why it does this and it seems completely random. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but that doesn't seem to fix it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Has trouble saving with ""java.lang.Nullpointerexception"" error. Either won't save or drops save quality down to almost nothing. Used to be one of my go to apps. Now it just won't save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Didn't work like the one from computer like I thought It would. ((this addon is for the pixlr team) I just meant I was a little disappointed that I couldn't do most of the things I could do on computer sorry if I wasted your time I had come looking for this because I was thinking it would be like the computer one and when it didn't it made me a little disappointed but other than that is great so I am fixing my rating)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Well now it seems they want me to pay subscription fee!I used this for years for free....gonna find something different....I give 1 star!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Spent 30 minutes editing a picture for saving failed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to be able to make edits and save without issue, but now, unless I leave the photo entirely unedited, I will be unable to save due to a ""java.lang.nullpointerexception"". For more info, I'm using this on mobile, and the issue persists despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I keep uninstall and install this app Cause have so many bugs Like my pic my photo is flattened I just hope you can fix your bug well"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for many years. I was very happy with it. Now, it starts making me answer quizzes for an apple tablet taking over the whole screen. Pixlr thanks for the reply. I deleted the app. I'm not on payroll, do your job."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Use the app everyday for making vinyl stickers. Only complaint is the recent update took away the double tap zoom in the brushes section which is the main one I use 😞😞😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Is there a way to save images as a PNG instead of a JPEG? Some images, I'd like to keep a transparent background."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be the best photo editor out there. Not sure what happened but the done button to save image and edit picture no longer works. Have used This for over 5years and never had an issue untill the past 2 weeks. Unft It looks like the ads banners got bigger and it cleared out the feature buttons (done and save image) 11/17/2023-Unable to edit images anymore, which really sucks. really liked this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for many years and I still use it today. I can no longer save my edited images, my photos keep saving in a location that does not exist on my phone. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few days back, it started working properly again but only for awhile. A java.lang.nullpointerexception error keeps popping up when I try to save my photos, unsure what that is but it has never happened to me til the recent update in Nov. 6 and still continues to give me issues even now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used and appreciated app for probably a decade. Suddenly the ""Done / Save"" option has disappeared. Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. No remedy. UPDATE: Bug fixed. Thank you! 5 stars!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I couldnt function on a daily basis without this app. Hoping for some cute holiday stickers!!!🎄❤️🧶"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It work but very slow and it did stopped working do not know why? I use other app like Adobe Express and canvas but not get any problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"With this recent update, Pixlr is no longer accessible from my Gallery for image editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used and loved this app for years but recently anytime I use it during editing it pops up an advertisement window in a separate web browser. This app is a security risk to your phone. Do not download. Until a proper update is made that provides for security patches this app will leave your phone vulnerable to malware and viruses. As well as potentially leave you at risk for banking and other secure information being stolen. Do not download this app. It will put your phone/info at risk."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Null pointer exception Everytime I try to save now! It worked great for years. Same thing on my other device as well. The update has rendered this great app useless now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I liked it a while lot more before they added so many options you have to pay for. But honestly if I could add it to my budget right now, I would."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I gotta say, I really love this app. It's very easy to use, easy to figure out, and has a lot of really cool, creative features on it that I'm really enjoying using as a novice photo editor. 😀😁👍 I've already made 6 photos on it, one of which I'm now using as my new profile pic on YouTube & Gmail. I have no complaints whatsoever. 😍😎😄😊👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No save option, from where to save my work? Please guide"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What a garbage app this has become. ""How would you like an ad to pop up after every button you hit??"" Omg 😭 Pixlr stoppp that is so sweet of you! Everyone loves ads so much 💕💋💕 thank you!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Won't let me do what I use to do. Can't download the collage to my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I preferred the original version. Quality/picture size wasn't cut down and the app background wasn't a blinding white"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Still a great app but have a tiny issue. I do appreciate the dark border being back, I was wondering about the white that surrounds the image you're editing. I was wondering if it could be changed to the dark gray as the border. You can't see the home or the ""done"" buttons if you zoom out. Plus again it'll be much easier on the eyes if it matched with the dark gray border."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Literally useless unless you pay $9 a year. DO NOT INSTALL"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not found much impressive."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updated version too much useless...👎 Bad app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not running on Google Pixel Android 14. Might be as you state. The app is starting but with an endless loop between your inteoduction pop up question. I never gets past those."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't edit photos properly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"After our feedback Pixlr demonstrate interested for the consumers, so much so, the new update give a end on bugs and the apk is more likely to performing wise. Thank you Pixlr team, I really recommend it 👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr is the best photo editing above all apps. I've been using it for years. It even works when you are off line. :)~"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What just happened on this update? I'm noticing that the app lost functionality, it will not appear in my 'share-to' screen to send photos to it for editing, and it also lost the onscreen controls after I make an edit to either save it or share it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App won't open anymore and I got an error message about a there being a bug. Bummer, it was my fav app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it ♥️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A good app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work without fetching my phone data."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've used this for light duty postprocessing and minor art double-exposures for a while, but I've recently tried to put together a wallpaper, and had to use double exposure with 100% opacity to get a small picture to fit inside a larger area, and the scaling ( scaling *down* ) was pretty terrible, and significantly degraded the clarity of the source image, so I can no longer use it for things like this and would suggest using something else since it's incapable of something so basic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app💥 Today there seems to be glitch with the app!? I used to be able to share a photo from my gallery app to he PIXLR app to edit ,enhance etc But NO PIXLR app option to share to ? It just disappeared ???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fun and enjoy. Thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"An amazing editing app. My best so far"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Photo editing is easy on pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"VERY good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Bna💖"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Half the features are locked behind a subscription but the app offers no way to log in to access them if you're already subscribed. Instead it tells you to subscribe again... It's basically a scam at this point. Subscribe on the Pixlr site then they attempt to force you to subscribe through the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Please add more tools like Font size font style"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've reinstalled this app a few times and each time I reinstall it more of it's been made premium and costs so I delete it again but when I first downloaded it I loved it as it was really fun and easy to use but now I can not use most of the app as most of it is premium and costs to much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Plz fix the bug..when i try to open it closes again..and says the developer has to fix the bug then update the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden I can't use it at all! I used to use it daily. What happened?!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bring us the Pixlr X features and this'll be five star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"been using this for a long time and love it ....needs more fonts and adding a BORDER COLOR to the fonts would be PERFECT"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but things aren't working as they used to. When I want to do a double exposure, only 4 of my albums are shown and I can't get to the album (and images) I want to add. I used to recommend this app to others but no longer will."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best/easiest photo editing app that I ALWAYS reinstall on every phone I get!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Much love for you guys . Adrift ✌💕"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!! It's my goto yo!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"it's easy to use and the saving issues got fixed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hate that y'all quit updating your app. This app has always been one of my favorites"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What happened to the option to negative your pic?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Its a real tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I had to redownload because I got a replacement phone. Now there are no editing features. And when I try to restore my purchases nothing comes up, even though it says successfully restored."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to give you my data to use app is a reason to not use it at all or to recommend it to anyone :/"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"had this app/ pro for many years, so, —⭐ A...because I got a new phone, redownloaded this, and now would have to resubscribe to pro again,( when I already had it )no restore. B...I am also seeing long, irritating ads. —⭐This app has changed for the worst over the years, it has far less things in it than years ago. Now seems basic and limited on what I can do. —⭐ no pip ability, or editing & other things lack the right customization. But app does still has some good & some free things in it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good apps sir"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it is the best app ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is a very good photo editor that simple to use and has some great features. I would have given it a 5 star as I have been using it for a very long time and can't fault it. However, with the last update being 24th November 2022. It would seem its no longer being supported or keeping up with Android updates. Which is disappointing as it will soon not work on my Google Pixel Pro 7 phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I installed the app as an alternative tool to edit raw ARW files. It couldn't read them, so I'll uninstall. Hopefully, the feature gets added in future. All the best to the developers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've upgraded my star count. I've had problems but I like old Pixlr a lot and the problems have received attention and my emails about issues have been responded to so part of my review is about email response which is great. I guess the app is old but it still comes in really handy and does a lot of things really easily for me. Thanks for creating it !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is app is just too lean, i was expecting the powerfull adobe photoshop like multi layer editing tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When I want to edit a wallpaper that's the size of, let's say, 7420x4320, it now reduces size/quality when it never did this, making editing and quality preservation nigh-useless and pointless. I've been using this app for 6 years or so and it's been my go-to, but now it's been nigh impossible to do thing with the quality one wants"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Always works well. The only mobile photo editing app I've used for years and still continue to use. User friendly, simple interface, great for everyone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"9/23..cant go back after doodling. Noticing bottom menu disappears sometimes. Have to back out and lose creation. Fix plz 6/2021 text drops blur. doodle...After selecting color plz hav it drop back to the prior menu instead of making us click on the color choice button again to make that go away. Need a go back one step too (in doodle). Also, the dot looks like it is all the way to left, but it isnt. Fools me. I hav to drag it left each time. Need circle function."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used Pixlr since 2013 when they were just a website. This app is awful if you're looking for a more advanced photo editor. Pixlr is far better on web than mobile. For mobile, I'd recommend PicsArt over this any day."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I hate all those new, trendy photo apps, especially the ones that make you look like a completely different person. I like the ease and versatility of Pixlr. And it doesn't make you look like an AI creation or put fake lipstick and eyelashes on your photos. I've used it for years and decided to pay for it now. I hope they don't change it or I'll be upset."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Mussing image scaling. It has many options but most of them are already in builtin apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great app. Except for the fact that I've paid for a subscription with NO ADS and yet I get ads and no access to special features. And no way to correct this. Wasted my money. Will gladly change my rating if or when this gets fixed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app from very long time approx around 8-9 years and literally loved this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Luv it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"There's no Arabic/Urdu fonts. It's a OK editing application, but since I'm low on storage and not currently using it, I've decided to uninstall it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I DO NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO USE MY DATA"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice app for some basic photo editing/touch-ups. I once paid 2 euro something for ad removal, which was a reasonable deal, but now they have changed that to require a subscription. The app is nice, but it is not THAT good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No one can use this app they leaked your data to darkweb."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very useful app most trusted & safe too"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst alpi"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hell Yeah Can Pixlr Come Up With More Cool Fonts Like Gangster And Script Fonts"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it! Its great for editing images and posting them on social media sites. This is one of my go to app for fast editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's a great app! I used it since 4 years ago... but recently, I don't understand why I make collages and when it's time to save them, the app it going freeze and don't let me save my files... it's really frustrating.. I hope you can fix it asap. Regards."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"this app spy's on you ,hacks into WiFi's records you...nothing new yet I have a great phone already. Pixlr ..the cats out of the bag👾🕳️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Not sure"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pls allow to use custom fonts"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid for premium on this app. Now suddenly it's a subscription? What a scam. Why did I pay for premium and suddenly you switch to subscription without telling anyone. Never again will I use this product."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"straight up trash"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Recently, the app has been crashing. A lot. The screen just goes black. And that is very aggravating if you are in the middle of a project."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Now It's ultra awesome.....🤩😘"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Pretty good. I wish it had more of the tools that the desktop has, such as the Grain feature under Details, or auto-centering when overlaying other images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love the features and it's really very fair regarding ads etc. They struck a good balance, truly. Thanks, pixlr team."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Had this for years it's lost its add feature"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for a long time professionally. It's the best for editing and some cool effects."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"No way to log in."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app to make money using graphic design concepts. It's got a great collection of useful tools that can get any job done. However the ONLY thing I'd recommend: Undo and redo button for individual strokes of edits. Not just for overall completed steps. Use this software. It's free and will get the job done right as long as you're capable of completing it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app until it decided not to let me freely crop photos. Instead, it assumes I want more than one photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to cancel subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app on all my smartphones, and I still use it on my s22+"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Infinitely wirse than their own web interface. And as fir the paint function? Microsoft paint v1.0 is better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This has always been one of my favorite pictures apps. 5 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app I'm using it since day one 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Name, zain ul Abideen"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sangat bagus untuk editing video"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Masha Allah very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for the past four years its has been my number one go to for all my editing work in some form or another but like all things that are great there's gotta be am update where it has completely rendered this app nearly useless. It glitches to the point of crashing if another window is opened. Frankly, it's going to crash eventually anyhow just by opening a new photo. This is just supremely depressing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashes in the middle of editing. Lose all work in progress. Looks like the app needs an update, badly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hello Plxlr, I been using your website for almost 5 years and it was great until the premium popped up. It said that its free, but I guess its no longer free no more. Please remove the premium in the website cause I want to do more image editings in the future."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashes using even the basic tools. Used to be my go-to app but now I would rather swap between a handful of other apps to get what I need."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have 5 years experience with this app ,so this is the best edit app i ever seen , But I have one un satisfy option with Font option because If i want give to shadows, or outline Ihave to use another app so I don't like to use another app so please consider my request and give some shadow and outline option for ""font"" I totally used this app 9 years include above review so far this is the best photo editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not like the website"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app! I use this more than any other photo editing app. I always use this app first because it's so versatile covering hundreds and hundreds of correction types. It is very powerful but so user friendly!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome👍 hu"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"there is no 'back' button, so if you mess up, you have to start over completely. Also, you lose half the quality to your photos. they will look blurry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I use the paid version. I would LOVE to see new fonts, new frames, new stickers, etc. It hasn't been changed in a long time (I think I'm on year 3 now, not sure how long exactly), would love to see some new life breathed into this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wrost experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have had this app for a LONG time and use it frequently. Curious though... 32 country flags, NO CANADIAN Flag Overlay?? 🇨🇦🍁🇨🇦🍁🇨🇦"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Always been a nice easy app to use. Seems like lessis being included free ei. Fonts The ads got bad but I think they toned them down. At one point you had to watch the ad before saving..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This works well on my phone but is difficult to use on my tablet. This is sad because if it did not have all the bugs on my tablet, it would be awesome and very useful and a great creative tool. Example Bugs; the tools randomly stop coming on screen, the tablet bottom navigation bar randomly covers the bottom tools while in use. There are some more, but I don't remember them all. I currently pay for the app yearly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this all the time in school and have finished many projects and gotten an A+ because of all the useful tools in this app I do reccomend :)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"collage option Doesn't work"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb 👌app But one problem sir Update to a version business Advertising Photo editor App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I have used this app for years and now every time I use it, it just restarts in the middle. I have lost work twice today that I have spent a long time working on to create a custom design. I wish there was some way to save your work without having to save the picture and it close and open up the picture and edit it again without being able to undo the previous work. So frustrated right now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This by far is my one and only editing ap! There are so many options that are free to use to make whatever picture your editing look super professional. There are so many filters and options that are free to use. It's also not confusing to edit like some aps. I highly recommend whether you're a beginner or professional. Or if you just want to have fun!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So frustrated that it keeps crashing on me these days. I've used this app for years and for some reason I can't even add text without it closing on me. Pls hlep"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's impossible to make color black, when I choose black color, text is white Also when I enter text mode app automatically zooms out view, it is very inconvenient But of course you don't care"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is so helpful I love it 😍 it's so handy and makes my day so much easier 😁 I would totally recommend it for all u're editing needs!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"My photos disappear after edit. I have the paid version! I am pissed!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love pixir"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good and useful application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been a Super-fan since'13 but I'm temp suspending my 5☆ s 'til I get my colored text back. ☆UPDATE☆ It turns out when ' high- contrast fonts' are enabled in my phones ' assessibility' settings, it disables the colorized lettering in this app! Issue now resolved-"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Brought premium [Never got it] - Emailed them about it and haven't heard back in a few weeks, still tells me to unlock premium to get all the features on the app. 🤦‍♀️ Yikes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Best photo app I've ever used, however keeps crashing every 5 minutes and completely ruins my phone for a few seconds!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Idk what they've been updating but it's the exact same as it used to be years ago, basic, not what I want. You can't even add an image to your image like it's so simple."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"app launches, but refuses to progress after task selection (photos/collages/etc). seems to crash. BUT, if the user disables their internet, the app works like it's supposed to. suppose that disabling internet cripples the ads . . ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good device ..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I always use it(2014). Edit 2023: lose quality when save and blurry tool is ridiculous...you can't blur a specific area, only the whole picture!. Idk why..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very Bad Not an Alternative of Snapseed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this a lot it's excellent 🙂"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mujhe to bhut accha laga ye app edit karne ke liye good hai"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Still the best photo editing app. Since a few months though, it can't save anymore on my Android 10 phone (not on the internal memory, nor in the additional SD card)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this to make a lot of my photos, album covers, and memes. It is SOOO easy to make stuff and is why I give it 5 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Annnddd. It was removed. No point of this useless app. It can't even do basic blurring."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Easy to understand and use and let's me do what I need to. Only critique is that the sliders can be a little extreme and a bit hard to fine tune but never usually a big problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of my all time favorite apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app out there.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stop robbing people, I've already paid for this application for the year and your trying to make me pay again even though I'm logged into the same account on another device, what you playing at lad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It has it all for free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent App👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best for photo edit."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Love it, but the adverts placed at the top make cropping difficult because you can't see the top of the photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saved files not showing. This app used to be great, but now the saved files no longer show up in my gallery nor any social media app I try to upload from."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is easy sure, But it's the same as the rest. I downloaded this to use my stylus to actually draw things not minorly manipulate photos. This is almost insulting compared to the website version which I can easily use on my phone. I downloaded this thinking I was getting a version of what the website offers but for my phone. No this is just like every other photo editing app out there. This app has zero special about it. Sketchbook does tons more. Would not recommend this, its way too basic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"No choice for banner"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hi, So I love your app, it's really great and I use it as the time. But if I even so much as go anywhere near the ad banner (I don't even have to click directly on it, even if I'm drawing an outline and I accidently trace over the corner,  it opens up a whole different app, chrome or Google playstore) and I lose ALL my progress on my work and I never have any idea when your ads are just gonna randomly open and kick me outta Pixlr. Could you guys possibly add an optional autosave feature please?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The App was great and I've used it for years but recently trying to do anything will crash the App. The Double Exposure feature lags it out and before long your edits are lost and you're sent to the home screen of Pixlr. Please fix this, I used to love this app but now I can't even use it. Text also causes crashes recently"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It has some tools I like.... Thankyou pixlr team"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Photos won't save or are saved in an unknown folder."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I never suggeste this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exceptional!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I used this apps it's useful for me..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, though I only needed it occasionally, but now it is no longer sufficient to just tolerate ads -- it is now heavily crippled without paying more than infrequent use warrants. Will find a new go-to photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've had this app for years and it's been great, but recently I can't get through 10 minutes of working on something without the app freezing and completely crashing. I even did a complete reinstall and it's the same thing. Please fix this app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have the permium account but can login via the app. So little points to have the premium. Hopefully this is just a bug."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Install to make a panorama, I can't find how..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I can't really say anything bad about this app because I haven't had many problems but reading the reviews I have seen that even in the 5 stars there is something wrong. This should be an easy editing app but when I was trying to overlay a picture over another it wouldn't work, there is nothing that tells you what to do, if you are stuck then your stuck. I wouldn't rate this any lower or higher that a 3 as it isn't bad but isn't good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"THE BEST OF THE BEST!! You will never find a better more helpful editing tool for the price!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I can't change the size of overlayed images or text anymore?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Literally exactly what I was looking for! An app that can make variations of my design with assorted colors & effects, while saving in high-res, no watermark.. thank you!! If ever I can afford it, I will definitely subscribe because this service deserves support, no intrusive ads either so far! One thing I'd add tho, is the ability to save projects, instead of having to get the image each time. Also maybe some more effects.. basically if FilterForge ever made an app like this, it'd be heaven! 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like it well enough...as I learn more, I believe I'll like it better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Why Did The Fonts Change?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app not remove your phone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. I've never bought an app or spent any money on them. with this app I used it for years and then one day decided to pay the yearly cost so I can have all the features offered which are quite a few. the yearly cost is so low that I don't mind paying it. but if you don't want to buy it then don't and you still have a great app to use. 5 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Happily using the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"always my go-to editing app. still have lots of options even if just using the free version."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I used to love this app and had it for years, but it has been extremely glitchy everytime I try to use it now. I will be editing a picture and then it will randomly glitch out and crash. I then lose what I was working on and have to start all over. I would love to give 5 stars once this issue gets resolved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I this app like crazy it is very nice to use"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, easy to use. Have had it for years. Wouldn't change to any other"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absurdly small amount of tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr used to one of the best photo editor apps, but there are a lot better apps out there now that don't contain ads now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Its an amazing app, when it works but it seems every other picture I try to edit or if I spend over 3 mins editing, the app just closes out of my open project and back to the home screen so all my progress is lost and I'm forced to start over. Can't deal with that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm not sure if same creators own pixlr website too but I have been using the app for multiple years and by far it is the ONLY editing app that actually left me satisfied in a long run. There is also pixlr website which is completely free and has a subscription for UNDER A DOLLAR per MONTH, it is easy to comprehend and use, has a wide choice of features and even saves your works for further editing. I LOVE both app and the website, especially for the fact that they care for users, not money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite app but I request just improve when we text on photo it's difficult to see preview and text setting on photo also difficult"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Been using since 2019, but lately saving an edited image takes forever!! Like 2-10 mins to save one picture! I'm on the same device with same service I've had for 2+ years. Hope this can be fixed because I edit a ton of pictures for my business and it's taking 10X longer to get it done now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A genuine review - Best of the best.🔥 It's my all time favourite ❤️ No ads No watermark. All the premium features for free.🙏👏👏 Everyone should appreciate this unbelievable effort. Thank you so much Pixlr🌺"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app and used it all the time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have lost so much of my hard work when this app fakes saving the image in a folder. If the folder doesn't exist in storage, this app just fakes the saving and when you exit the app and try to see the image you saved, there is no image and no folder. This is a great app that is why it didn't got zero stars. But I wish it can just make a folder on its own or ask us to do it first 😭😭"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to editor. I find it totally worth the $6/ yr or whatever, to unlock all the features. Now I'm changing over to a new phone and will see how user-friendly it's gonna be to restore my purchase."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes on Galaxy Note 9"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's a basic image editor... Issue: When increasing/decreasing any adjustment, it don't render that in real-time on screen... I have to adjust it in multiple little adjustment..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app since FOREVER and loved. However, since switching over to the Galaxy S23 the healing tool now leaves gray marks on the saved image where you edited the photo. Tool bar at the bottom disappears from view when the app is switched over to another and there's no way to see it again unless i close the app. Looked into the settings and there is nothing that would cause it to do any of this. Please fix!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Q: Where are the files saved to? ...................Absolutely THE WORST on locating where your edited photos are located on your Android device. Extremely disappointed with this... I'd gladly pay for a full service app with instructions...,.......... But numbskull e-marketers are convinced the free-but-we-own-your-data model works better.......grrrrrrrr!........ uninstalled"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't change color of ink. Healing/editing is horrible. Just not the same as when I purchased the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app for 3 years and still continue loving it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Every time I saving an image the app sipmly just not saves it (even if the message says that the image have saved successfully) After the reply of the developer things are better. Thank you."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used Pixlr, it seems like since the beginning of its existence, and now I've deleted it! Since new updates, it won't let me save the work by blocking the top menu button ""Done"" by putting a banner over-the-top wanting me to install Tik-Tok or some other app and I'm not going to fall for the scam. I will just use the editor that comes with gallery and goodbye Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible They RUINED this App. Absolutely wasted a bunch of time because it keeps crashing. Loaded with annoying ads and in the middle if multi step edits, CRASHES MULTIPLE TIMES AND NO DRAFTS ARE SAVED. This app used to be a go-to for layering, but now it is undependable and essentially useless. What a load of absolute garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the Best app for editing I love it just"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Happy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's great ! I’ve been using it for a couple years now and know how to work around it well. There are ads now but they are the very top of the screen which is mostly out of the way so they’re not too bothersome. If you are looking for a free photo editing app that allows you to edit freely or with the help loads of templates, designs, stickers, borders, double exposure, blurring, and more this app is for you! It even allows you to adjust the dimensions of the end product which is great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app ever."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Save image stuck at 50%. How to get it save to 100%?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sjib Mm Nh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love the effects in the app. It's one of my favs & I've used it for years. I docked a star because when I edit pictures with a transparent background I cannot get it to save my pictures with the transparency, it always adds a black background to it which I hate & that makes it unusable for editing any pics without a background or with any transparency."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Loud pop-up ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's so good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love using Pixlr but having a problem today. Try to paste text from my clipboard and usually can edit text easily, but for some reason the spacebar and enter botton aren't working, and I can't get the text to fit properly. Can you please fix? Currently this is unusable"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Don't recommend the subscription it's almost impossible to cancel."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"not up to date I use Pixlr E on a PC, and the UI seems completely different and more up-to-date than the mobile apps. I know that obviously you can't do what you can do on a computer on a phone, but they could at least modernise it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When you crop a screenshot - making it smaller - instead of just cutting out the area you want to crop, the app completely distorts what's left of the image and makes any text just a blur or worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good gooder goodest"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I absolutely love this app, except that it doesn't actually save my edited photos anywhere... I have to take a screenshot of my edited picture and then crop it to size. I've tried uninstalling, but it still doesn't work. It hasn't always been like this, but it started around last year. If this can be resolved, I'd definitely change to 5 stars, because I do LOVE this app and use it frequently for my youtube channel with my son (Rich & Joe Bushcraft) and other social media sites."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Solid game try it or else!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Tried and true. Been my #1 for years even after trying dozens and dozens of other apps. Simple, yet so effective. Thank you PIXLR!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app such awesome filters"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I''ve been using this app for 5 years now. No other free photo editing app comes close. What you can achieve with pixlr are many beautiful, unique and endless possibilities. The user has freedom and full control of their photo editing and art. Many possibilities and easy to use, bravo to the designer of this app. I have asd and still sometimes struggle with new technologies. I was able to use all features with no problem. Thank you for making this app user-friendly to ALL !!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best app all time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome in every way. Been using this app for years. It does more than expected and the quality is exceptional."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The app is great to almost perfect, but can there be a way to add other photos while your editing one; to like say you're doing a side-by-side comparison, or like trying to edit a photo onto that one. But like I said overall a great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"SUGGESTION make it so that you can crop it to whatever WHILE BEING ABLE TO SEE THE SIZE."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It crashes and says you need to contact the developer as it has a bug.😭😭😭😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app been using for years. Please reinstate the retro fonts though!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Idk what has been happening with this app, but nothing works very well anymore. The stickers do not load. I bought the subscription, restarted my phone, and none of them download."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"wow!d best apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Hey guys if your interested in gaining the extra star here are some suggestions, design more professional like frames, have option for a grid in order to align pictures..you already have the grid it's just not a optional thing throughout designing, other than that you done a great job, many works of satisfaction using your application so thank you, I just subscribed, keep up the good work 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Only use as an alternative to the default photo editor, it's a good app with lots of features that's free and easy to use, but the app has a lot of ads, none too intrusive though. Also the collage feature somtimes just doesn't like the resolution of photos and it bugs out the whole collage. Overall still a great photo editor been using it for years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"No undo for some drawing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The Google form is better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My picture can't be save, what happens???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Favorite editing app for a long time now. But, I swear adjustments used to appear in real-time when you draged the slider back and forth making it easy to fine-tune the image. Now you have to drag the slider and then release it before the adjustment pops in. Dragging and releasing, dragging and releasing, dragging and releasing, just to see results makes it very hard to fine tune an image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My photos are saving to an unknown location on my phone. I've lost a lot of work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was told it could stitch photos together making a 360 sphere panaroma. Does not"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"If there is pixlr there is possibilities"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Becomes useless if they don't even have an UNDO option on the drawing (doodle) screen. You have to back out of the drawing screen just to undo. What??"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best photo editing app I have found"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Downloaded to Compress image , Could not find how to compress so Uninstalled"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"glad that there's a darken and lighten feature, however, the app is not usable because I downgrades the quality of the image when it saves it. noticeable downgrade and size also goes down, for instance m original was 1.45mb, and the saved image is 1.13mb. please fix the loss of quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"thanks Admin"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not bad"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr used to be a good image editor, now it crashes constantly even trying to do the most basic things. It's straight up unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It still needs a lot of improvements."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this app ive been using it for years but this pass month i have been fighting it! It keep freezing my phone up with a black screen!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"If you really know how to use this app, then you could become a professional editor for sure it's honestly a good replacement of adobe.😁 I've definitely made money off of Pixel-Photo editor"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's really a great app am a long time user using it from last 4 years still perfect well done team💯💯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I use the website r a lot of my stuff including gfx or grafical artist. This app is bad. However I dogthink it's made by the same company or the need to update it..."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once I'm using collage, it's showing that loading for a long duration, but i haven't created a single collage after installing this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"How do I cancel? Getting charged monthly for a few extra elements. Thought it was a one time payment."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"A decent photo manipulation and editing tool, but replete with trackers that seek to ID you plus target advertising towards you. Do not use if you are privacy conscious, at least not without a good VPN solution."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have not install it😴"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app violates data protection legislation. The app requires access to personal data and app usage data in order to display ads. Without such permissions, the app does not work. It is wrong. And this does not comply with the law. Moreover, all the permissions granted are involuntary and therefore null and void.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I am not able to save college. Tried several times, reinstalled the app and yet i found the same issue. Please fix the issue, its very annoying when i invest my time editing photos for a while and just after i press the save. It hangs! It happened many times!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app use to be great, but now it closes when I select certain things in the app. There's no update available so I guess it's just junk now. Very sad to see, I use to use this app a lot back when it actually worked"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a good solid app and I am happy that I can use it offline again, after the latest update,and with out loss of what was paid for before. Sure, there are others with more bells and whistles, but this one is has what it takes as an excellent photo editor."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"For years, I've loved making colleges with Pixlr. Today, where it's storing them flashed on the screen for a second or 2 - way too fast to actually read it! I redid the college hoping to get an idea of where it's storming, but could only read dcim. I've searched every way I know how and can't find it in that folder. Too frustrating for me to spend any more time on this! Would y'all please find a way to make it obvious where the pictures are stored?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mucho mejor que cualquier otro de similares características!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't expand pictures. All in all clumsy and worthless app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years now and have always like it however today I signed up for the 3 day trial and was immediately charged and charged the wrong price on top of that. To say the obvious, I am pissed off. As far as I'm concerned this is false advertising. Now if this matter resolved I will song the app praises, but til then, I am giving a rating of 1 star."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years now. I rated 1 star this time becoz of so much ads after the last update. Now looking for alternative and will get rid of this soon. Reply: ads were not this aggressive before. Everytime I try to do something, it opens up a website/playstore and ask me to download an app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Desperately needs documentation. I've spent the last hour wrestling with this thing, just to stitch three images together. Collage is making one of the images huge, with no apparent way to adjust that. I considered resizing the image but I can find no such feature. The blog says there's an Add Image feature, but where? I'm done banging my head against this particular wall; I'm just gonna export to my PC and do it there, like I should have to begin with."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I USED TO LOVE THIS APP. Tried to crop a photo several times today. Can no longer find the SAVE button - only an ad along entire top & no timer counter to alert an ending. Came to reviews to search complaints for similar issues. I guess I'll shop new edits apps.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"LOVE Pixlr! Mobile Android user for years. Worth every penny for yearly subscription to get their ""secret sauce"" effects & filters. Am a professional photographer & Photoshop user but there's magical looks I achieve easily & only with Pixlr. Unlike other mobile Apps what's so special about Pixlr is the use of applyng overlays & filters & using eraser brush as a selective ""mask"" to paint to delete the effects selectively. Endless fine art fx are achievable incl wonderful borders"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Seems fine, but I needed to draw some squares and there are no shape tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I like all the features it has but it is very sensitive when in doodle mode. 4 times I spent almost an hour on,zooming in and tracing lines and correcting, and 4 times it backs out to the last screen causing me to lose all I had done. Not happy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Charges u a 1 time fee to use doesn't let u get past the interior and the app is not working for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Using this on a phone is pretty hard to do but on a tablet its a joy. There is so much you can do on this, its on par with Photoshop 3. I so want to pay for it but it comes up with an error and so left with the advert/locked stuff."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Lovemaster"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app , but no longer allows me to save to gallery, wants to save to files and have access to all downloads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is a laughable. It cannot do features that even microsoft paint can do, like erasing. Shameful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work at all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love your app, been using it for years. Theres just one problem... Why cant you save something as a draft? Tell me!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Userfriendly, simple and effective app, but lots of improvements are to be done like enhancing the quality of graphics/stickers, adding a clone tool, adding more fonts especially decorative fonts etc are to be done. A recent bug not letting is to use double expossure tool."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So after using it a while on my new phone I happened to notice I purchased pro a few years ago & had nothing but paywalls for stuff so under Options I clicked Restore Purchase & I get No Purchase to restore & I know it is under the acct I'm in or logged in on play store & it shows I paid under Play Store Options or Settings??? Can u fix this?! Im also a lil concerned no1 ever replied to my request 4 Undo button last review but hopefully u all r still working on this really good photo editing app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I reinstalled the app almost after 10 years thinking they might have added new features and improved the app way better than before but guess what there's nothing new it's just the way it was 10 years ago, what a shame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Was the best photo editor but after last Android update it just doesn't load, shame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cannot set vertical scale for 3:2/4:5/16:9,so bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Honestly you fixed something that didn't even need to be fixed I don't like the new update because I can never find my edits I don't know where they're being saved to and every time I look them up it just magically disappears but it's eating up space on my phone you should maybe consider looking that over. I started with a certain amount of gigabytes and now I have barely any because you guys are saving photos to somewhere where I can't find it!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"An excellent app. However, there's still ads on full version, even though no ads were promised! Otherwise I would've give four stars, but I just hate ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Please unblock my WhatsApp number sir immediately"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Fine but cutout option missing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You've had multiple opportunities from unsatisfied reviews to fix this app, but the multiple glitches and crashes continued through the years and multiple phone upgrades. I had hope that it'd gotten better with time but its worse. I was a paying user, but the lack of respect for your users time and effort is no longer tolerable. I'm not going to be loyal when there is no loyalty in return. The only changes made are the invasive ads. Thanks for that. I will be using an app that ACTUALLY works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I wish they had a reasonably priced pay once option to just remove ads. Used this app for on and off for years and it's one of my favorite photo editing apps but the ads are annoying and I don't like subscriptions."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good. And mid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great photo/image improvement app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app crashed after hours of working on something. All the work done, gone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years without any problems. Forced me to update recently to keep using the app. And today the Pixlr app disappeared off my device completely. The save folder also corrupted, over 400 photos lost. Re-installed to see if that would help, but it didn't. App won't save any new edits either."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads have become absurdly excessive. I understand, everyone has to make some revenue, but after every single edit save? Really? No thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Salamt sa liwanag mo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nunca decepciona 💖"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Everything is wonderful about this app expect that it reduces the quality of a picture big time when u save and the brush tools are very hard to use, please improve them for a 5 star 💛💛💛💛"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to open images now even after clearing cache or data. Screen locks and goes black. Unfortunate because this app was good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"add text feature sucks, has stupid spinny thing ruining any text on resize"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO FIX THE BUG IN YOUR OTHER EDITING APP - PIXLR-OMATIC!!????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ad freeze is fixed, thanks 😎👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I danload but dose not have any of those features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"THE ONLY BEST APP FOR EDITING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This is the only app I use it for editing, there is no alternate to this app, it works very well on mobile but I am facing issues on my laptop while using. APP ISSUE ON LAPTOP: Once it is installed on the laptop it works only that time, next time when i try to open, it never opens and I have to reinstall the application to make it in use. Team please fix the Laptop version. Thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Since fixing an issue with the ads, Pixlr is back as one of the top photo editing apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this app as my go to editor but can you please fix the red eye feature as its been broken for a long time now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"A good one..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😃😃😃😃"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Needs to have a feature to lighten shadows"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my go-to app for photo editing but now the adds have become so annoying and will often get stuck forcing me to lose any work I have done on a project before I can save it. Unfortunately I will have to find a replacement app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UPDATE! Constant CRASHING before you can save images!!! PLEASE FIX 🙏❣..ie• did delete and reinstall - no help there."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app. Is a one stop photo factory. it's everything you can ever want in a photo editor. Font's, Sticker's, Frams, Picture in Picture, Write things on the picture and much more. Resize, Color choice... Absolutely Amazing........ That was from 2019 my last Rate. It's now near Halloween 2022 🎃 And I use it just as much as always. They've been adding good stuff all the time since the beginning."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible greedy app development! They make you watch long Ads for doing a save to your device! And if you don't click the Ad to go to Google Play it freezes and you have to watch it again! Bad experience!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Every time I try to hit the done button after editing a photo, there's ANOTHER ad. Don't download this trash if you value your time. Honestly, it's not even a great photo editor anyway."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for years and have loved it. I've told many people about it when they complimented a photo I edited. Now any image I attempt to edit is saved in such POOR QUALITY. Severely pixelated. So disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app is sucks for years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the most used photo editor apps I use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I LOVED this app for so long, now I can't save without an ad playing and 85% of the time the ad glitches and won't play so I lose my work. I know its app and not the device because ads play on litterally everything else.Unfortunately looking for a new app that will actually let me save my work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be my favorite photo editor but slowly declining in features. Now I can't even save an image because the adds freeze. Editing a picture shouldn't be this complicated, deleting and trying other apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for several years!! I use to absolutely love it!!!! But now they've added ads to it and I keep losing pictures when I go to save cuz I have to watch the stupid ads so I have to restart so going to be deleting this app and finding something different sad I've got like 6 years that I've been happy with this company but not any more!! Super disappointing to get a poster set and have to restart cause the adds won't play all the way through or glitch"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great features, but way too many ads, unless you use the premium paid version. Also, stopped opening after the latest update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. The new ads suck. Hate em. I'd deal with it if I could save collages but I cant for some reason. Lookin for a new app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After few updates, this app is UNUSABLE! Try to crop a pic. Ads, ads, ads. The app forces you to watch long video ads before saving. Also, it seems to reset the default save folder after an update. UNINSTALLED."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New review: I would not suggest that even a great app should be ruined by disruptive 30 second ads. Old review: Simply cannot compare less to any other apps in terms of its range and abilities!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Still no way to actually save after editing. Time waster that used to be excellent. Please fix."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Actually useless. Took me maybe 5 minutes to save an image due to intrusive ads taking over the whole screen. When I finally saved it, it was so compressed as to make it unreadable even on a phone. Source image was a phone screenshot so I don't know why it would be compressed smaller than the resolution of the device I'm using. I use Pixlr on browser but the Android app is horrendous."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years and loved it. I don't usually complain about ads but in photo editing, you have to save constantly in every step. The commercials every time make this app unusable. I would gladly pay to upgrade but the app really doesn't offer too many tools that my stock phone doesn't have."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been crashing a lot lately. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache, cleared data, nothing seems to resolve it. Very annoying when I'm working on something and whole app freezes up."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very Bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be one of the best editing apps until ads destroyed it's legacy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This is one of the best free photo editors"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads. Not enough features to keep using"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Please add an undo button to the Heal tool in addition to the reset button. I often make small mistakes and have to start over."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All of the reveiws by ""a google user"" are all faked by them, not letting the app speak for itself. Contacted them about fixing a bug in their app as they said to do and they just told me to use another one of their apps that doesn't even do what I need that pixlr does. Yet the last update was somewhat recent. So Idk if they are supporting the app still or not."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So frustrated by the recent bugs. Used this for years now but within the last few months it spontaneously crashes in the middle of editing a photo, goes back to the home screen, and I lose all progress. Contemplating spending the money to switch to photoshop just to avoid this constant frustration."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Editing are good like a Photoshop"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Can't find the resize image option. Terrible app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years and the occasional adds were fine. Now there are adds all the time and they freeze so I'm unable to save the edits I've been working on. So disappointing.... time to find a new go-to photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I spent 2 hours editing a photo and drawing in pieces in a composite that were missing for Pixlr to glitch when saving and delete all my work with no option of recovery. Update: 5 months later and this issue is still not fixed, use any other app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ADS are a problem. - Forces a click on the video ads in order for the app to begin export & save photo. The vid does not load until you tap so it takes you to the ads web page + still need to watch the vid. To circumvent this - use the app in airplane mode. I understand developers need ad $ but this is an annoying way to generate it. I support pixlr on web app (aka I pay) but that purchase doesnt transfer. All around lame & invasive ad tactics is making this editing app less desirable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Awful video ads. I don't always have good reception so the ad just sits there until I force close the app. Also doesn't preserve PNG transparency?? It's getting to the point where I don't even want to use this app anymore. Are there any good alternatives? I've been using this for years but it's time to get something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I CANT EVEN DO ANYTHING"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good photo editing app, now you try to save the image and the damn ads ruins it and will not allow it to save the image. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I LOVED this app for editing and have all my favorite settings saved... but i have not been able to get through one picture without an add changing screens and locking me out since the last update. This is super frustraring and i am on the verge of looking for a new way to edit my pics. Please, please... fix this ad problem!! I would rather pay an app then be this frustrated."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app used to be amazing for me. Now projects get lost cause ads for Facebook, which I don't have any desire to get, freeze and won't load properly, forcing you to have to close the app and restart your work. Just add a watermark and make it able to be erased with watching a ad instead of forcing it on people."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The bes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You can't save without the app crashing because of the ads. I use to love this app, not anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible issue, ads repeat when I click save image. I can't save my work and the ads replay. Trash app would rate 0 stars after years of it being a good app, sad to see it go."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It ues to be a good app. But now when ues it go and save what ive done it just dose save it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"FIX YOUR ADS. When I go to save my image, the ad pops up, which is fine but it keeps freezing and it takes almost 5 minutes to get it to finish playing the ad so I can download my image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ads freeze up the app..getting old"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After many years using this app now Sucks! So now after working editing an image and spending so much time on it there is an ad before you can actually save the image to your phone and that ad gets stuck so can't save the image... ""Genius"" who thought of doing that so people can watch another ad before actually saving their work... Now for me this app is COMPLETELY USELESS, have to look for another developer"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have loved this app. It's still good, but at keast half the time the ads Won't Go Away. I try to save and sometimes I get a pop up ad that does its thing and moves on, but others will not stop. If I see the one with Dio de los Muertos I know I've lost my work because the ad won't quit. Maybe in the next bug fix?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The paintbrush and eraser tool does not work what is the point of having it if you don't allow it the customer to use it I'm glad I didn't waste my money on your app because it's garbage uninstalling and never downloaded it again"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Full screen ads glitch and don't play, saving is impossible. Yet another useful app totally ruined and demolished, rendered useless by its own dev team. What an absolutely shameful thing to do to such great software. Absolutely shameful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The tools are great, but new intrusive ads make the app unuseable. Full screen unskipable ads freeze halfway through, forcing you to close the app and start the project over from the start."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not usable with ads. I used to love this app so much, and used it regularly. The way they have decided to do ads now makes the app completely glitch out and I can't even use it now. So sad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"My app is now opening and I figured out how to save my work. Thank you Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amezing, mind-blowing, fantastic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I PAID to remove ADS. Now the app has changed to SUBSCRIPTION model with lengthy ads. It does not restore my l purchase or revert to the version I paid for. Bait & Switch!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I like your app but I don't like dealing with the adds so I'm going to find another app to use!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Verrrrry baaaad app lag lag lag"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't support this company anymore. I got their original app, Pixlr-O-matic. LOVED it & paid and DL'd EVERY filter they had. When they came out with this one, I did the same. BUT with every new phone (and let's face it, we have to get new ones every so often) it was more and more difficult to download the filters I had PAID for. Now, I can't. NO ONE can. Look up Pixlr-O-matic, read the recent reviews. You'll see the complaints. And if they'll do that to the app that made them, expect it here."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible, ads are intrusive and annoying. 😒"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads do. Not. Stop. The same long Instagram ad now appears every time I do anything with this app. I deleted it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used only this app for years for photo editing. After this most recent update I can no longer save my work... What's the point!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Images don't show up when saved"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Went to save image in documents, said it saved, but it didn't. Went to change save location to downloads said I can't use that. I don't need broken program."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Everything was perfect until some of the fonts stopped working..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very useless. Made me watch the ads to not let me save the pictures I edited. Waste of time. Won't recommend. Avoid using this app. Would put zero star if I could. Bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's very good, and user-friendly. The collage feature is very in-depth too. I will say though, it's a bit lacking in features for adding text to images. But most of all, no matter what edit you make to an image even if it's minor, if an image passes through this app, the fidelity of the whole image goes down a decent amount."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer any good I used to LOVE this app. Now, it never wants to save the image. I get the ads--whatever. I wouldn't mind them if the image actually saved after watching them but it doesn't. Uninstalling. There are so many similar apps that are user friendly compared to this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and loved it, but recently the ads have gotten far too intrusive. Half the time you go to save something, it plays a 15-second-long video. The ad pop-up is also deliberately delayed to bait you into clicking it when you try to hit the ""save"" button, which minimizes the app and opens the ad link. Worst of all, the ads frequently get stuck indefinitely, forcing you to close the app and start over. Was good once, became trash, trash gets dumped."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad app to use. Don't use pls 😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless as photo editor, the very basics photo editors on most phones these days have more functionality than this app, the Galaxy S22s photo editor blows it out the water."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App stalls when ads load and prevents saving work. App has become unusable. Will be uninstalling and finding an alternative."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Something has changed. Suddenly there is no way to perform multiple edits on a picture/jpg and save the resulting image. The downarrow for saving never shows up. What gives?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Too many adds, not enough editing options. Been using the app for years to join two or or more pics, but the ridiculously long adds keep replaying several times preventing saving the image and the editing tools could be better. Devs, if everyone has the same complaint, look into it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sorry, if you think i have time to read a thousand page software agreement to try & figure out what your app does or doesn't do to my device & my privacy going forward, even ifi delete; you're sadly mistaken & you certainly don't have me backed into a corner with anything else in to choose from for a photo editor....well your even sadlier mistaken..... FAIL.....NEXT !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Useful app but now there are video ads that must fully play through. Can't even finish/save my project if my internet sneezes. Ads are fine but let's be reasonable devs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Still a good tool. Ads not worth it though."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was great until the newest update. When you go to save a long ad starts to play that after it's finished you can then save. The issue, the ad freezes and never finishes, thus not allowing you to save at all."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save images. It forces you to watch an ad before you can save but the ad always gets stuck/ never finishes and keeps starting over. Do not recommend."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wanted to edit one image was invaded by ads, was unusable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be great. The ads continually get stuck and you can never download the pics lately. Not sure what's up."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be my main editing software. For years. Now is just flooded with ads. What a shame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads!!!!!! I've never seen more in my life!!!! I'm worried even if I blink thiers gonna be an ad in real life wow y'all tripping me out🤦"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used it for years but now these ridiculously long ad videos are too much. Y'all wack for this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Avarage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App changed added ads will not get past ads to save photos keeps going back to the editing page every time you push done it goes to the ads you exit the ads it goes back to the editing page it's a cycle that doesn't stop there's no settings anywhere before editing to show the download file location that needs to be fixed the app is worthless without being able to save your progress I used to love this app now it sucks sorry"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice tools!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app forever now but the ads are just ridiculous now. Why do I have to watch an unstoppable 30sec ad just to make an edit that took me 2 seconds to do? I'm not using this anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"These ads have gotten out of hand. I can't even browse filters without an ad playing. This needs to stop."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Collage crops don't work, crops out everything. Doesn't apply edits to photos. When I use the paint or erase tool and hit the checkmark to apply changes it just cancels the changes. ADS ARE RIDICULOUS. CONSTANT AFTER EVERY EDIT. YOUR GREED IS DISGUSTING. UNINSTALLING."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,",,, luv it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Long time user but the app has become unusable mobile wise with all the ads and app crashing. Never had issues until the last update. Also extremely Pixelates images after saving on the app now. Better to just use the pc version of pixlr unless pixlr app makes some changes that make it less of a headache to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, ads ruined it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I rely on this app to make quick posters and it easy and fun!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and used it for years now I'm done with it. Ads have gotten so ridiculous and too many bugs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, easy-to-use. I have been using it for more than 5 years. I'm retired I use this app as a hobby, It's therapeutic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great app for most part just have to buy a bunch of things"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It WAS great. ...but now just internet junk like most of the rest. Sad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app for photo editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was a fantastic app that I used for years but they recently introduced insanely long and unskippable garbage ads. I was 100% okay with pop-up ads the occassional video but they got too greedy. Uninstalled forever. Byyye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favourite ... Love this app. Thank you very much"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app I would use it every single day, now there are just way too many ads it's bananas. I would give this thing five stars in the heartbeat but now since the ads are all over the place now you can't even edit half the time I'm going to have to give it a one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sweet editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Q: Where does it save when you press 'done'? A: It doesn't"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Why did you remove the noise filter in the image? Now this program has no superiority over other programs. Noise creation is best filter"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The long, intrusive ads make this unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app on a regular basis. Friends would ask me to edit pictures or create funny memes for them. The advertisement for the mother/daughter game is extremely long, boring, and to save a picture you have to sit there for roughly one minute in the entirety of the preview before you can ""X"" out of the preview. I won't be using this app anymore and will be deleting it. Short advertisements are one thing, but it just isn't worth it anymore. It was fun while it lasted, then it wasn't"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was always my go-to editing app for pictures, but now it won't let me save photos. I just get ads in my face whenever I try to save them. Even after watching the ad, it will freeze and not save any of my picture edits. Looks like I'll have to find another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app to edit, mix photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its amazingly effective app....i m using this since 5 years and i m happy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app now it's the worst app ever with the stupid ridiculously long ads that constantly freeze. other people have posted about this and they just reply with yOu ShOuLd bE AbLe tO eXiT tHe aD aFteR ViEwiNg. no you can't you stupid morons because you can never get through the stupid ad. fix the problem or stfu."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"a 30second unkippable ad every time I want to even do a simple edit like just cropping a picture? I enjoy using this app and would pay for a premium version to remove ads. but subscription only? this is just ridiculous"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads out of control"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"RIP Pixlr: too many flaws for money. It's missing histogram curves editor (have a look at Huawei, Asus Zenfone and so many others...) and custom ratio crop. Denoise filter is missing, too. No image resize option. Not enough improvements since 2015. And you ask us to pay for it? Downgraded from 3 to 1**... Sorry, guys! Nothing else to say."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Deleted my collage cuz of an ad crashing the app. It seems small but thats frustrating when you spend time creating something. Just use something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've had this for years. It's great but i can no longer save photos. Every time I'm 'done' an ad pops out and when I the ad is over the photo doesn't even save. It takes me back to the editing screen. What a waste of time. I watched the same ad 4x and none of my photos were saved"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my go-to for, literally, years. But the constant ads and the fact that they're freezing now, making me have to start all over again, I just can't anymore. You developers should give me the option to buy instead of renting every month for no ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cant erase anything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trash now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I honestly love the app. The ads kind of are a pain to get to load, so I would recommend screenshotting your piece before you hit done so at least you can save your work if the app crashes due to the ad, but overall I love this app! Especially the brightness/darkness brushes. Those are so great and highlighting specific spots in your photos!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are ridiculous now. This sucks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was great before but now it plays those HORRIBLE long game ads when you want to save your photo and they glitch and never finish. If this isn't fixed, I'm definitely going to change to another app and uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There is a 60 second ad of a cartoon mother and daughter crying, 100% of the time I try to save a picture. It always freezes partway through, and if you click it, it restarts. It never plays. It never finishes the ad. It is literally impossible to save your photos now. Get an app that doesn't suck."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a PERFECT app. Now they joined everyone else with lame subscriptions or you'll be spammed with long, soul crushing ads. I'd be willing to do a one and done one payment price (like 10 to 12 bucks) to pay for the app versus the yearly garbage but they don't offer that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to LOVE this app. Been using it for YEARS on ALL my quick phone shot edits. But now, whenever I save, the result is always a blurry image that looks MUCH worse than what I see while editing. What happened!? It looks like a blur mask is applied by default, during saving!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Md. Mutalib"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used Pixlr as my primary editing app for many years. Until the most recent update, it was by far my favorite app for creating graphics. Since the update I've noticed several features are no longer available. I can no longer enlarge or reduce the size of a late image. Turning an image 90° is no longer possible when laying one image over another. I also am no longer able to increase the size of an image with two fingers in order to see minute details that may need to be edited."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"An ad popped up on the save screen and froze the app, causing me to lose all the progress I made. Thanks, very cool."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: fullscreen. unskippable. Video ads. Every Time You Save. The only option to remove ads is a subscription. I had re-downloaded to give it a second chance but this is disgusting. Looking elsewhere. F this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hii wow¡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was an excellent app till the last update. Now to save, they start to play the stupidly long ad with the crying mother and daughter game, which always freezes. If you click on the ad and then back up, it starts the ad over just to freeze again. The only thing to do it exit out of the app. Either way, the outcome is you cannot save your work. Worthless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this for years and years and loved it until now. After the last update every single time you go to save it pops up the save screen then forces an ad in front of it. And the ads have been glitching as well so you end up just losing all your work. I'm going to find another app that actually works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great until it comes time to save and the Homescapes ad freezes on my phone. Please remove Homescapes ad, there is clearly a glitch in it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app allways was my first choice in terms of mobile photo edditing , and it was a fantastic app for years untill it isn't anymore , bugs, glitches and etc."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"They brought the ads back. Super annoying. I get the need for ads but right in the middle of working on something an ad opens. So I just get out of it and do it on another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be my favorite photo editing app until the absolutely insufferable ads started. One thing would be to include new, better features and label them as Premium, other to add a bunch of useless, unrelated advertisements that pop up multiple times and sometimes even lag out, preventing you from saving the image and making you lose all your progress. Avoid it and search for something better to spend your money on because they even have some ridiculously priced subscription for what you get."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used the free version for years and it has been great. There was some loss of functionality after the Android 13 update, but the developers were quick to correct it. Very responsive support team."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Here I am, rating this app only because the ads are so annoying. Don't bother with this unless you're going to pay for it. It used to be good. Not anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Not good for me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best pic editing app I've ever used. Had it for years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I bought Pixir because as I said before it is excellent. I do not know how I would manage without it. The adds were not annoying as they appeared when the graphic was done but Pixir is so very good that deserves to be supported. Pixir is also very easy to use indeed. I said it before and I say it again: Thank you for a super app! Deserves 6 stars!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years but there is no way to save edits anymore. It's an endless cycle of ads and no option to save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I wish we had the option of free trial without using a card.You can't force me to subscribe your app pay first than use terms.I am interested in your offer to use offline. Add option to download new fonts in Indian vernacular languages e.g Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi. Similar to your app Phonto is very text app which supports all languages fonts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for a good while but the redundant ads after every single edit is bonkers. I wouldn't mind if it was every so often to support the free app but every time I save an edit, the same 3 ads...is there an ad free version?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now I have to watch a 1 minute commercial if I want to edit a picture, then it never plays all the way through and I loose my edit. I will nit be a customer qny further."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"it good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but they really went overboard with ads. The ad for prostate cancer meds was full minute long and made me sit through it twice in a row. Most of the time ads will freeze until I tap the screen, which then opens up the ad's website. Don't know if that's just me but seems weird that I have to click on the ad in order to get the app working again. Also they don't include a mute button which sucks if you're listening to music since you have to use your phone's volume buttons"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I absolutely loved this app and had been using it for years. Now when I go to save photos I have to be quick otherwise I get stuck in this loop of ads playing and freezing and replaying then freezing again and there's no way to close or opt out of seeing the ads. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm a bit disapointed that this app is rated 3.5 stars. It should be at least 4.5. I've been following Pixlromatic for quite a while and it has been my number one go tool for quick editing. It always worked like a charm, no ads, no BS."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After adding ads the experience has been awful. App has become unusable. You go to save your edits and the ad runs then freezes. No way to skip the ad and return to your edit. Only option is to close the ap and restart the edit. That is if the next ad doesnt freeze also."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great editing app but recently long video ads make it inefficient to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"EDITED - Developer replied and the issue with collages being non-functional is now fixed so I'm putting my score up to 5 because everything I use it for is working fine again. Haven't encountered the infinite looping ads issue myself but I also set my ads to be non-personilized which kills a lot of suspect ads from experience."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've had this app on my phone for yrs used it all the time and I would still be using it but it won't save anything guess im gonna have to Uninstall it and find one that does. Or is there a fix in near future???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Probably Malware. Bad business practices. Won't let you save image after designing it. Trap you in infinite add loop. Tried to exit and -re-share multiple times, still trapped in add loop."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I really loved this app and I think it's extremely useful even now however I am uninstalling because it's been almost a year and I have not used it once and the reason I stopped using it is because after updating my Google One membership and getting access to the premium features in Google photos it makes this app as well as a lot of other photo apps irrelevant. However I still highly recommend this to anyone looking for a creative edge."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"insane amount and length of ads to a near unusable degree. turn off wifi and mobile data before opening the app and it becomes tolerable ;)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"was fine until i got ads ever single time i went to save a photo. not to mention the ads woud freeze and i would have to click on them to unfreeze them and they would restart. i spent more time watching ads than editing my photos. huge shame because i had been using this app for years and i cannot stand using it anymore. finally uninstalled"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Rubbish, can never find a saved edit anywhere again. Makes this as useful as a hammer without a head."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I absolutely adored this app. I have been using this for years! However, since the last few updates, it has been glitching terribly. It's to the point that it's hardly usable at all! I spent hours editing a book cover today - ignoring the glitches mind you - and when I clicked the save button, an add popped up and all of my progress was completely lost. I'm literally crying. Please fix this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wah g wah"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Opened app today, 30/9/22, it contains an ad to win an ebike. My AVG phone protection flashed a warning, its a scam!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Always happy using this feature with my personal pictures only! 👩"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When reported issue to devolpers they tried to get me to use one of their alternative apps essentially saying Pixlr is old out of date technology not compatible with latest OS Been using this app daily for years to apply text to photo content. After one update 17 of the retro fonts turned into plain sans fonts all identical. Tried reinstalling, even tried a different phone still the same issue. Figured it was just a glitch & they'd rectify it in a future update, but that hasn't happened."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for years, and it did everything well, but someone has changed it to include your work being hijacked by ads. You can't save or share anything without having to see some strange ads. It's a shame...shopping for another."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wah!! Great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No cut-and move option. Intrusive 3-minute+ long unskippable ads that will not buffer, every time you select a new tool. An unresponsive Save button, and once Save does work, I've gotta make an entirely new folder each time. Whovever made this app is a rank imbecile of the highest order and should be very ashamed of their sad and pathetic existence."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo editor I've seen by far. I've had it for years, the updates have been great. I've tried others but I still come back to this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Has stopped working completely. Uninstalling after many years of use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fast Edit app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"F*** you and your add placement. Damn annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps for editing photos!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"""Collage"" and ""Template"" suddenly stopped working. Those were my main needs. If I want to do normal cut/crop/edit stuff I use Google Photos or Simple Gallery. I only used this app for the collages, and those are broken now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app would be great if it wasn't for the ads that completely prevent you from downloading any of your projects. They're insufferable and you can't X out until they're done, they freeze halfway through, and I give up on 70% of my projects and end up using Canva instead because of this one issue."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pathetic with ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Literally been using this since middle school and it's still my favorite. If yall take suggestions....maybe a more advanced side and the ability to have layers that I can go back and edit?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app has become unusable in the last month due to the ads, you cannot exit the ads to save your images. It just gets stuck in a replay loop. I used to use this app several times per day so I still try to use it out of habit but I can never save anything anymore. I see I'm not the only one having this problem and Pixlr's response is not saying they're fixing it but rather that it shouldn't be happening. We know that. Very frustrating that a great app is no longer functional."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice Photo editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"bro why would u show me an ad abt sewerslide on a CAMERA EDITING APP... get that garbage away from me man it fr ruined my entire week"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great editing app once you learn how you can use all the features!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years but the ads when you save your picture have literally ruined this app!!!!!!! THIS APP SUCKS NOW!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"😁"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tons of ads that are very long before you can even save your image. No thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best photo editing apps available with the ability to crop, rotate, sharpen, shade & enhance colour & texture of pics. Filters, stickers, lettering & special effects all available for free with no pesky ads. Very highly recommended!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"wow ang galing HAHAHAHAH"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"30 sec unskippable ads, downscales images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads, ads, ads. That's all it is is an ad farm."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are like 2 min long and don't load. So it just freezes your phone. And not a great app in the first place"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What happened to the collage feature? I see the button but it doesn't do anything when I tap it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app almost every day, for years, but with the latest update it's actually unusable. The political ads relentlessly pushed through the app completely freeze it up before I have a chance to save anything. You really dropped the ball here, folks. It's an Uninstall from me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved the app for years but the ads are too much. I understand the need for revenue but software companies are the worst for switching a free piece of software to a paid one. You can't step backward when making the switch and expect to retain any loyalty or good will because you're creating a bait and switch and people hate that. Even if you dont intend it, it's manipulative. When switching revenue modals you have to leave everything you did in the past and step forward from there."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not sitting through 3 minute game ads to keep a collage. Used this app for like 2 years, Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads have become so obtrusive and malicious that it's not worth using. Avoid this app unless you like your phone being hijacked and forced to multiple websites."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be an incredibly useful app. Now the video ads are so intrusive and obnoxious that I'd recommend trying a different app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads keeps interrupting my work to the point that I don't even bother anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a couple of years now and I've always loved it. But now with Android 13, it is not functioning. I cannot bring up any templates or anything. The only thing that works is the camera. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing fixes it. at one point when I tapped on collage, It kept saying items not found. But having said this, if it works on your phone, i think you'll love it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app, but there are many, many better ones out there now. I paid for the app outright years ago, but I'm now getting ads. There's no way I'm paying for a subscription when the app is as poor as it is. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I understand that devs have to make money from ada but this app takes it to a different level. It's almost unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"May not be top rated, but is top notch in my go to editor choices. Does a lot of things simply and usually shows few ads. If ads increase however, I may have to bring it down one star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"A once great app now featuring up to three 30 second videos and ads before you can save each item. I realize it's a business and all but good gawd!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like it over all; there're some issues like the add wait and the lag, but it's managable, however the 4 stars are for the app icon; there is nothing wrong with it, but my selected samsung theme won't round out the corners and for a graphic designer that's a ""scracth my eyes out"" type of pain :D It just shows up as a sharp edge rectangle. Is there anyone that can help me out? That would be greatly appreceated, thanks in advance)♡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Using Android 11 -- Nothing has changed since 3/17/22 -- Needs more work. No undo/redo anywhere -- just reset which sends your image back to the way it looked before you started to edit. Doesn't matter how well an image editor works if there's no way to undo or redo your last edit. 👎 Uninstalling Again --"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are unbearable Update: Developer says the ads are there to maintain and update the app and if I want an ad free experience to subscribe. Here's the thing. The app is not even functional with the excessive advertising. Why would I subscribe to something I can't even test the functionality of? Why would I support a developer that sells out to advertisers that hijack their app and manipulate it's functionality? There are other apps out there that do the same thing, I'll just use one of those."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great - still is, functionality wise, but lordy the ads are manipulative. You watch an ad but don't hit the ""x"" button or you'll miss the opportunity to SAVE your image. That was down right malicious... I just watched 6 ads to save 1 image until I ""learned"" how the app was functioning & where the save function was ... located. It shouldn't be this difficult!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My once 'go to' editing app but now all my double exposure pieces are blurred and I can't use it. Emailed the team 4 days ago, heard nothing so it's going on here for others to see. I use my phone to do all my picture editing but I'll be looking for a replacement for Pixlr. It's gone from hero to zero in a blink."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I too love infinite ad loops"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Good features and functions, and easy to use if not for constant relentless barage of ads getting in the way. ads make it unusable better off with an alternative or pay for the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"After updating to android 13, collage is not functioning. When pressing the collage icon, it said ""no items""."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice, can be better I would like pixlr to have a round cropping tool if possible. Also a 3D tool to make the image you create or edit here into 3D."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is biggest surprise of my life😍😍😍🎉"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So sweet app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Meh..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"How can I make a video. Very upset..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Most recent update issue. After the most recent updates, i have been having issues saving files. Ads take too long. And there are way too many more ads added. It used to be simple ads and quick and easy to deal with. It has gotten very fustrating. Been using this for a while and it just got worse. I was working on something and saved it and only to find out it never saved. Fix it because whoever took over, is dumb."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very very good quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"1.When adding text, there's an unreasonable limit on the # of characters that can be typed. 2.There's no realistic way to align/match the size of two seperate texts/fonts. 3.When resizing fonts there's two problems. a)there's always a pause just before the resizing pinch takes affect. b)When applying a resize, it changes slightly, so it's uneven. 4.Add an undo option that doesn't just delete. 5.Fonts & frames, though nice, are extremely limited. & 6.Saving often depreciates image quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app itself isn't too bad, but it's becoming more and more obselete as newer apps come out with more features all the time, and Pixlr just doesn't keep up. Now you have to watch ridiculously long ads just to save your work, making it super annoying. Honestly, the only reason I keep this app is because it has a lot of fonts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My fav go to app for editing photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely nothing different from Photoshop collage except for being bombarded with ads to no end...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Edit: In settings, there is an option to remove ads and provide extras otherwise unavailable without a subscription. I paid to remove ads a couple of years ago and I don't appear to be getting any and so I will continue to use it without paying a subscription. This is a pretty good app and worth getting if you don't mind a subscription model or if you can live with ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too much Add"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Fast and rich editing capabilities. But for me a crucial missing feature: not preserved meta picture data (capture date, camera info, rating, etc.) when saved after editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Will be uninstalling, used to be my favorite editor, now we get to play ""where did the file go???"" and watch TWO ads per photo...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app, nice filters, awesome blending modes. The ads have ""calmed down"", it's 5 stars again!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Best app ever for photos editing, All tools are best!! Nothing is gone wrong with this app it still work good and still using for 10years. Need to say add something more in the texting as outline, shadow, emoji stickers, diffrents shapes of brushs, collage selfies live and negative filter is very important. Still five star for this app 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 great and amazing app All the best!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be my go to for everything editing wise but ever since the unskipable adds I've had enough I hate to do it but it's got to go ☹️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"zero Quality Apps of the year"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Oh my God! The ads are so incredibly loud and intrusive! You have to mute the phone before saving anything. The app is not worth a subscription fee. At best it is not worth more than a one time price of maybe $5. The are much more effective photo editing apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best photo manipulation Android app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"খুব ভালো"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app used to be a solid 5 all day long. I've had it since day 1. The full page, full volume, highly intrusive pop-ups and ads really messed up a good thing. Yeah, they got to pay their bills, but at our expense? What a shame to have to realize, no customers, no business. The result of selling their souls to the advertising demons. Now, it sucks rocks. Big Time. Update: A year later and I can honestly say I hate the intrusive, annoying, and rude full screen, and lengthy ads still. Blows! 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: The ads got better for a while but they're really bad again. Having to click out of multiple ads for every single photo edited is too much. The ads in app have gotten way worse. You can't even use the app anymore without having to exit out of the app store constantly. Makes it almost unusable. Will be looking for a different editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ADs have ruined the app - UNINSTALL"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I liked this app a lot. It was very good, and easy to use. It recently began crashing as soon as I open it. So I nolonger use it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nope. Too many permissions. You're a photo editor, you don't need access to my location data. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute dogshit don't install waste ur tie"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When tou go to save the ad never loads so you can't even save it after clicking 'done'.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amezing application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app but I have a suggestion about the phonts. If you add stroke? Also if you add shapes magic draws"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage. Spent two hours creating an image for it to crash upon clicking ""done"" TWICE in a row. Crashes take you back to the home screen. What exactly am I supposed to take a picture of, here? The main menu?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love editing my photos, and drawings in the App!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"2 ads to save a picture?!?!?? This app has gone downhill. I've used for 2-3 years..... unfortunately, there's TWO 30 second, low pixel (Facebook) ads to save a picture. I'm uninstalling, there's better stuff out there."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads now make ot unusable. Congrats. Greedy idiot."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very good application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My go to app for quick edits. Quite easy to use & full of features. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Modify Karo yaar 5 years se aak hi tarah ki outlook and no improvement."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is awful, i couldnt even find the selection tool, i think the web one is much more better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Arayüz çöp"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Love the app but has some drawbacks. Need ability to add text and color to an empty collage box to create captions. Should be able to custom resize photo ignoring the aspect ratio."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I had this app in my previous phone for years without an issue. So I downloaded it again, big mistake. Constantly running commercials not just pop up ads, and when I try to find my edited photos they're hidden in such a way that it takes a while to find them so I can share them. I also find it funny how there's a veiled threat when you choose to leave a review. Like if you leave a review we're going to tell everyone your account info and what kind of phone you use. 🤣🤣🤣"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Poin... L"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The app says I'm offline plenty times when I have connected"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Osm 👌👌👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"4 New Update 👎🏼 0 star"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I honestly love this app but now it will never open, keeps crashing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best for editing pics"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Disgusted by the amount of ads on the app. Not usable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Would be much better with an option to resize based on pixels. I don't understand why app developers don't allow this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My edit-pal."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for a long long time and it used to be my go to app for editing but honestly it's a disaster lately. Every time I try and use the darken or lighten tool it ends up effecting the entire photo instead of just the part I'm trying to work with. So the end result isn't anything compared with the photo I'm seeing while editing it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Every things are ok but there is no space at all 🤔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to have this app a few years back and it was fantastic,downloaded it tonight and uninstalled after editing one pic. The ads are horrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I was surprised to see the new update. Hard to believe this is Pixlr. In a very helpless condition."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"5 ♡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be a favorite but now I can't even save photos or use the app without ads popping up constantly. The cost to get what you want is expensive and not worth it. Save your money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This used to be best editing app, but the recent update ruined it .. Ads and all of sudden you get a pop up of subscription and there's no option to get back to the work you were working/editing on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: I paid for this app back before subscription model. Now I change phones and it's forcing me to pick a subscription to remove ads. GET THIS FIXED or your losing another person to them switching to Photo Studio Pro...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Lemi"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Ads that loop disallow saving unless you disconnect data. Limited text editing options. Leave it to Autodesk to screw up perfectly fine software. They do it so often I wonder if it is purposeful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid for ad removal years ago, this the only editing app I like, now it also keeps crashing while I'm editing... Smh..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easily the best mobile image-editing app I've used. So many features!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work wile cropping an image and double exposer it on the previous image. The cropped image dosent come fresh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Dedede, and little mac"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When choosing a photo, it always defaults to oldest first. There doesn't seem to be a setting in app to fix the default sort order, please add this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"There was a time that this was a good app. Now it is just mediocre. A simple movement of the location of a sub picture from bottom right to top left in a collage is impossible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It doesn't even save the image no matter how hard you try."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Love this app but its glitchy right now and not letting me use certain filters. I really need this to be fixed, this is the main editing app I use. Giving 5 stars once this is fixed. Also please make sure Atomic filters are available for everyone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I hate the new save option! It won't save my files to my own folders! I have to make a folder and I can't access the image at all! I want to reply in tweets and text messages but it's not letting me access it! I'm highly disappointed and will no longer recommend and I will uninstall and won't come back until it's fixed back to the way it used to be. Shame. This app used to be the best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Can't understand why others gave this app a low rating.v I love it!!! Great templates. Great choice of fonts. Highly recommend!!!❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Yas"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Crashes constantly! I've never had an app crash as much as this one does. I love everything it does, I really do, but you can't get anything done because it crashes before you can even do a couple things on a photo. It seems to be related to the ads along the top because I notice it freezing when the ad changes. I would give this 4 or 5 stars if it actually functioned like it should because I love everything it offers. Bummer!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice App Good Work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"How do I turn on Pixlr editor?? I am looking everywhere and can't find ANY place to open it. This is infuriating. Show Pixlr editor and I'll rate higher. 0/10!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you for replying changing location worked Please add selection feature to make the app a greater one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's become completely unusable. Every time I try and save a photo it It exits without saving to the home screen of the app. I have no idea why it's not functioning, The app itself is up-to-date."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app since since so long. App is very good but nowdays i am facing some issues. While editing picture like face blemishes correction.....it gives green colour to the corrected area . It's so annoying. Can you please fix my problem as early as possible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ok ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Vikas Sarak Yeehee je Dee ehdi Dee mi dne Emejd"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app I have ever used.. I will give it one star only"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hey! I dont know what you did but Pixlr is now working on my phone. I love this app and all the cool filters and frames. Im super happy i can use it again! Thank you!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Now it just crashes connnstantly.👎🏻*thppp* Might try it again some other day but for now it's getting uninstalled and replaced with something that isn't going to give me a headache."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When I first used it, was so good and really enjoyed the app.. However since a year whenever I wanna use it, it doesn't work unfortunately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be 5 stars but now photos won't save. Submitted a support ticket and received no response. So disappointed because this used to be my favorite app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It seems impossible to find the cancel button!!! I tried the full features and i don't think it is worth it so i want to cancel. Why is it so hard to cancel the subscription??????????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good for quick fixes, but there's no way to delete any of the photos, not even the originals, after you've improved them. So the memory is taking up too much space on my phone, making it run slower. PLEASE ADD A DELETE PHOTOS BUTTON."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A wide variety of tools, filters, frames & other options to create your very own unique masterpiece! *** NOTHING in life is ""free"" If you're looking for free, your phone comes with basic camera and gallery apps. If you're looking for GOOD, pay up or watch ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When i heal an image, it gets gray after image is saved"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sabae acha potho editing app wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"U suck..!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"If you're looking for Pixlr X from computer, this is not the same, though is the same company. The download quality, even when I set it to high, is pretty bad on my device. I'd rather just crop a screenshot then use the in-app downloading feature. Other than that, it's pretty good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"lots of ads, not much options to edit photos and I can't edit photos I'm working on. The web version is honestly way better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Anytime I add text and press ok button the quality of the text drugs sooo poor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't limit access in accordance with gdpr rights. Options screen only informs you of data gathered"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I been using pixlr since years. What I like about it is you get a lot of things for free. One of the best photo editing app available. I usually use it for quick edits. And can give you close to professional results very quick. Thanks pixlr!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app, do all my art on this one app and it shows!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hi please dont seem to the viginette option"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr photo Editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No realtime adjustment of brightness, contrast, etc, so you constantly have to drag and release sliders to see the result, which is pretty annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My friend recommended this app. Easy to use with great results and tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and a lot of very useful and interesting ideas."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Solid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but photos no longer save to gallery. Other apps all work fine it's only this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super App. I enjoy it, keep on making it best."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved this app for years and then they started shoving intrusive autoplay videos at max volume which is extremely ableist and actually injures me because I have hearing aids as a legally hard of hearing person and my phone audio is always routed through my hearing aid so when these disgusting ads pop up and play while I'm trying to use the app it causes me actual bodily harm because they do not vet or volume control the ads nor do they start muted. I should sue to be frank. Just fix it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used many similar Apps... This is THE BEST for collage and picture editing!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I used the apps website at school for a digital art project. It worked very well for that!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app is HORRIBLE!!!!! When i first opened It i knew it was going to be a lot worse than the website which I've used religiously for years. The layout was unprofessional and uninviting and felt ""closed off"" if that makes sense. The actual editing part (AKA the whole point of the app) was difficult and tiring. I used this app for 5 minutes and decided never to use it again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good many features and easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used this app for Years, love it so much that I now have the paid version. Had a few issues after a recent update but after an uninstall and reinstall I was able to restore purchases and resume fun again!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the most efficient editors. I like it."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Very average"

Seriously here going to need another one.... you can add filters & Crop & 8 even overlay which seing how l have tried almost every other free Picture Editing app on the market... the overlay feature is the most priceless option in my opinion. That you for your time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"LOVE it!!! Easy to blend with other photo apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it! Its like a mini photoshop, gets the job done!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo editing app I've uses ever."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps closing after a while and impossible to get to work again unless I uninstall the app and re install it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"HRhhe ex"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Manufacturer falsely states that app will resize images. The stated functionality does not exist in the program."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"If this app cost 100 bucks I would pay it. It is hands down the best and just unique editor I've ever seen. Period."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"With so much on offer this app for me tops the lot,,if your looking for a great photo effects app look no further download it and enjoy...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Has been randomly closing itself the past couple of months. Not sure why."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Recently I can no longer change the color of my lettering it's either black or white! What the heck ?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It just dont save my edit's😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool, but I still have a wish list. But don't we all. Idea: when adding a second image over the primary image, we can size 2nd image, rotate it, selectively overlay it or erase it; a nice feature would be to flip it, invert it, to place it as a mirrored, or reflected, to be a mirage or looking glass image. Right now, all that has to be done to the 2nd image before working on placement into the first, primary image. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You can't even add a secound picture- 0/10 compared too the desktop capabilities, there's noting for the app.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I rlly dn’t thnk so, duh..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My All time favourite"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Better than the default photos app pre installed with new phones (present)I n some good ways. Free cloud storage is lovely & appreciated, making up for,say ...ex: Editing..is Limited, truthfully screamed...for Google photos. This one's Cool though."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app daily for years so I figured the least I could do was leave a review."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't save the photos in your phone. I am uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used for years but out of nowhere I am experiencing unexpected crashes during the editing process."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Super app i liked very good edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Has plenty of power and is able to do quite a bit for a mobile editor, buuut for some reason on OnePlus devices it saves files to a nonexistent folder that the Gallery cannot locate."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I need free of cost.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My every day photos take on a whole new look after I use the Pixlr tools! Best of all, IT'S FREE!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cannot save my picture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"i give 4 star becoz there is no resize option 😥😥"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why do we no longer get as many font choices? Aren't you supposed to build onto your app, not ruin it?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When cropping an image, the ""done"" button can't be hit without activating the ad, making it impossible to save any edits. Unusable without paying to remove ads. Just charge a fee and stop claiming you're free if your ads make it useless. Removing the app..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent picture editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Meh, affordable membership, but not anywhere near as ""variable"" filters/frames/stickers as most similar products."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a long time and even recommended it. I don't know what's going on but I can't finish a project. This happens every so often. Plus the ads are extremely invasive. I think they are set up to prevent use of the app. Maybe this app has out lived its days."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I can't load any photos to make a collage, if I share the ones I want to use with the app it just says loading 1/ however many I tried to send and just does nothing more. I end up closing the app and trying within the app. When I first open it it opens onto the camera which it can't find (and the camera on the tablet I use isn't good enough anyway) then when I finally find the menu page and choose make a collage it is the same story once I pick the photos to use it just says loading forever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ""Heal"" option is not working properly. After healing picture when you export the picture, you can see the spot and mark where you did the healing. Fix it asap."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You can't alter text after adding it, which is fine; but after you position the text where you want it and hit ""done"", it'll move just the slightest, making it impossible to align it. Edit: New issue! If you adjust the aspect ratio of a collage, it will distort the size of (by compressing or stretching) the photos to fit the collage rather than use the positioning and sizing you decided on when you hit save, and this is only visible when you look at the saved file. Dropping the rating to 1/5."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's top"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app went from my most heavily recommended apps for its ease of use & its power to edit (mostly!), to my biggest regret in ever recommending. This app is otw to being just another shuttered trinket in effigy to apps when they were great, tucked in some dusty corner of the app store! The ads are OUTRAGEOUS - they trap you from use for 30 SECONDS when you ""Save."" Worst of all with ""saving,"" such a high priority to lock you out of use to advertise to you glitches a fatal craah... smh :("

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Help me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's basically a good app but the free version has become almost unusable due to the ever-more-intrusive pop-up ads. I'm considering paying money!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years to edit all kinds of photos. It's easy to use, great features and all the free parts are amazing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"PLEASE FIX THIS APP! The app will not open single pictures to edit! I even tried reinstalling it and nothing. I cannot edit single pictures."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best free editor for removing acne. It's a little tedious but in the end it looks good. Ads are there but not in the way. I only used it once so far but I think I'll keep it around. I tried several other apps that were so bad they got deleted right away."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but you are locked into useless game adds at the end of photo editing for quite awhile. Time to uninstall. Edit Added: Sorry, moved on to different photo editing software and I uninstalled Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Using since 2014 , Just for basic editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"اا"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Too many ads that take over the screen and do not allow me back to the app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I will rate this app 5/5 when they let us have collages of 16 & 20 pics again. The max is 10 now & it used to be 20. Also, I could zoom pics when I was doing double exposure edits, now we can't even zoom, which makes it super hard. Fix these 2 things & it's almost a perfect app. P.S. I have been using this app for almost a decade. Used to be better because of those 2 things I mentioned :/ Updated: 1 star now cause all the things I could use for years, need to be paid with a subscription now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Pretty good app. Very basic though, and wants to default save edits in a different location than ""Photos"" where all my other ones are, so it's kinda pain to use sometimes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Absolutely my go-to photo editor. Great for filters, erasing blemishes and wrinkles on selfies, and for creating memes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Rated it 4 stars because honestly it's a fantastic app, it has everything short of layers, and it is getting more ads instead of more features every update. But then I saw my review get deleted, so I decided to one star the thing, and I will continue to write these reviews until someone addresses me properly."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"So far the only app I've found that allows basic raw editing (cropping, image quality adjustments) on a mobile device without needing an account or subscription. The free version is pretty good but falls into the category of apps that work better with muted audio to get around the ads. I would be happy to pay a reasonable one off fee instead of a subscription."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love this app, but I can't even use it because of pop up ads. 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fancy and great to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app and sometimes paid for extras. Since last update the ads are not only more active (fine, I get it the need to use them for free accts), but intrude onto screen while editing an image and have caused loss of detailed, difficult work several times! This is not okay."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app to work with 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Had this app for years and loved everything about it. But now it wont let me save anything I edit to my phone. The ads drive me crazy and the whole experiance is not worth it. 😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is now considered malware and should be removed immediately. It showed up on phishing apps jist this year. Look it up and remove, delete, uninstall immediately. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years with no problems. Idk what has happened recently but it's not even showing the pictures that I currently have in my phone. It seems to be showing some that used to be there but are no longer. I've uninstalled 4 times"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"LOVE this app and have had it for years but lately it's really buggy. Some features get glitchy, the app randomly crashes, and it won't save my photos after editing (which is really annoying after spending all the time it takes to do the edits)"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"amazing working now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be a favorite app but with the intrusive ads and a monthly subscription it is no longer on my device."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using Pixlr since like 2014. I've NEVER had any issues with this app. IMHO, All this time I thought it was the best. Until recently. It's to the point where the ads pop up while you're actually in the app editing photos. It's bad enough that lately the ads have been incredibly & increasingly annoying when you go to post on social media platforms but as of lately they are plain outright intrusive. Might be time to find something else and move on from this app 👎🏽💩"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best application ever ! I personally loved it and u can use easily if you looking for a creative & amazing app guys go fòr it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Won't save inages. Awful app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I got the app and never used it. It charged me $22.00 and I didn't even purchase anything. There is no contact number to ask about my problem specifically because I want my money back or I will delete the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's a good app, even after updating to include new features. However, it now crashes much more frequently mid-edit than it used to. I've lost hours of work. Moreover, despite having bought the ad free version in the past, there are yet again ads as it's now subscription based. Kind of annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why did you remove a clone option from this app?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for as long as I can remember I love it it does everything for me! To me it's one that comes already installed. Because as soon as I get a new device, It's gets automatically installed.;)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is still the best free app of it's kind."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it my camera that I have my picture kept going off of my dog and now she looks like a martian I love it it really works if you can add it on your camera I recommend it highly five stars"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"*Changing rating due to this app consumes 2 GB!!!! I have used this for years. I have downloaded other editing apps over time and none can compare. I take and edit all pictures on my phone with Pixlr and people are amazed I only use my phone. Thanks Pixlr for making me look good😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The developers approach to advertisements should be branded false advertising. Ads override device mute, you can't close them, or fast forward them or even remove the apps permission to play through speakers. That is when the app will even open. Today it opens and force closes over and over. Final straw. I'm done with this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So brilliant like a pro photo editing experience."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps popping up video ads at full volume and chewing through my data. App is not worth the Annoying behavior."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The new way you are forced to watch advertising makes the app much less usable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"** updated 2022 I just want to let you know that you guys ruined the app with the number of ads that you have. I am OK with you making money, but the videos that take a minute or 2 just to save the file, making the app not worth it. Which makes the first tag in your app description not true: ""We're constantly working to improve your experience with Pixlr Express."" You just made it horrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"App seems to be giving trouble, I'm only getting errors on my s8 active. I normally use this app without an issue."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Forced closing on even basic editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing continously on my vivo x70 pro plus.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this excellent app for quite a while. Never felt the need to review it, but feel I need to now. Only recently when you click to save the image you get automatically hijacked to the app store page to add another advertised app they think you want. The hijacker doesn't allow you to read the advert and return to pixlr, or a back button. You end up restarting the app to get around it. Now I paid for advert free sometime ago, and it eventually started plying me with ads again. 3/10."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"HOW DO I GET AND PAY FOR THE ""AD FREE"" VERSION???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My Fav🤍rite App F🌼rever 🌼💜🌼"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I gave a 5 star but after I clicked awesome on accepting the apps access... the app keeps closing. Hence I uninstalled and reinstalled and wound up here again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps stopping"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thanks... Bro"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was good but new ads are overkill"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"So many ads these days😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Won't ever use again - stupid amount of ads over 30 seconds long which you can't even click off afterwards. If you want to watch a minute long ad every time you crop a picture, go ahead and download!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The eraser doesn't work . No selection of objects to edit or erase is provided"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is crashing after opening on samsung galaxy A5 2016 mobile"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app used to be my favorite. Now with sometimes three screens you have to close out of , and insanely loud music that comes with some ads this app now is the worst. They went overboard on the ads its not even worth being free anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I'm getting malware - just tried to use the app and it's redirecting me to the play store for apps I've never heard of"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is supposed to be an alternative to photoshop and gimp but it's the same as any other photo editor generic filters, backgrounds and some basic features it doesn't even have the ability to ad or subtract layers it's nothing like photoshop or gimp you can't even adjust transparency if you choose the doodle option if you want to use this as a free alternative to photoshop or gimp for character creation and design it's useless save yourself the trouble seriously it's generic and useless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"EXCUSE ME... But restore my purchase. I had this app for many years & I don't appreciate to buy again on a yearly subscription. Waiting for your response. Then if I'm not satisfied, I'll reach out through email. Thank you! 😤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"TikTok installed without permission. Lots of Instagram ads. Difficult to learn with so much interruptions"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on Android 12. App keeps crashing when opening a picture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after years and years of use. It has intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why does this app crash constantly 1 minute in and delete your creation? I've loved it for years!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Add is popping up at the end of editing (before saving my work). I do not mind ads, since I understand why they are there. But, the issue is you can't escape from the ad after it's finished, so I am never able to go back in the app, and save my image. So the whole app is useless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Nice Application ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I've been using it for many years now, but today I got some troubles using it so unninstalled it, then installed it again, thinking it'll work, the bad thing was I lost the picture that I edited from this app, and they are all important to me, can you please bring it back and fix this editor app because I couldn't edit at all... Please... Thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, now you have to deal with ads that literally won't allow you to do anything. Ads that last a long time and freeze up your screen. Been using it for years, but I'll be deleting it and moving on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to really love Pixlr and have been using it for several years, however recently my overall experience with this app has plummeted. It's constantly crashing sometimes in the middle of editing photos, the ads are very intrusive, certain tools glitch and cause issues with your photo that you have to then correct. Hopefully this app can be restored back to it's former glory. For now I'll be limiting my use of it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"mid. pc version is better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my GO-TO photo editing app. Before, I only had to deal with an occasional ad when saving my photo. But now the ads are more like spammy pop-ups where the app will open 3 at once when you're just adding a filter or effect. It's so obnoxious at this point, not worth having to click through ads almost every time i go to change something. And no I will NOT be buying the ad-free version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The worst app now that it bombards with very long ads that you must sit for minutes before you save your work. Free laced with Torture ! Might as well call it Nazi Death Camp app. Hate such people and apps. ( Freedom of speech , expression and facts ) What do you, who laced it with these horrific ads have to say? I bet lies and excuses. This is your way of forcing people to buy app. And I bet even then there must be ads and issues. Buy some shame or I can make you that app for FREE !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to use this app to make memes all the time, but the ads are getting too long and constant to be worth it. I'd recommend a different app or just a website nowadays."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was great once but is now simply a constant stream of annoying ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I always used this app. Now, it is terrible. All you guys had to do is ... nothing. And it would be perfect. Now, when it saves images, they are poor quality and pixelated (even on 'max'). They aren't such quality when I am photoshopping. Also, the amount of ads is insane. If I try to save an images it throws me onto a randome website. So both of this means I'm better off just taking a screenshot of the photoshop."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great free app. Now when you go to save an edited photo, the app runs EXTREMELY INTRUSIVE ads that are impossible to leave even AFTER sitting through the entire advertisement. I've lost photo edits as a result of the ads that I worked 30 minutes+ on. I'm about ready to uninatall the app and find something new. If I could make a one time purchase to remove ads I would, but they want you to pay an actual subscription, which this particular app is not worth."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free version puts ads over the ""save"" button so it cannot be accessed, just repeatedly looping on whatever the ad links to and forcing all edited work to be discarded. Ads became animated with loud music and cannot be stopped or interrupted as they play for several minutes. I've come to hate this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Can't select multiple photos. Can't delete photos. Opens to menu instead of picture folder. Sorry, it's to much work for what I want to do."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of my favorite apps but they have let goggle play destroy it you can't even use it anymore because of the adds its abusive and ridiculous to be honest I'm being forced to look for something else there's a point where to many add are just to much no one could endure this I'd pass unless you like punishment"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uses to be the best app available. Now it's nothing but adds. No thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I don't want to give 1 star because it deserve 5+ stars but after new update i'm getting ads and no offline editing without paying. My 5 years of love has gone. Always love you pixlr but for now i'm done with you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ويلڊن"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not free......."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is extremely underrated. Easily the best photo editor. Thank you for making it free!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"crashes constantly mid picture, issues with transparencies and the color pink/magenta causes crash. images come out blurry. not reliable. has issues with any small images. Deleted files and broke my phone upon uninstall this comment has been edited to reflect that the app is worse now. The devs don't care. No you won't hear from me again. I hope you all suffer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"DON'T DOWNLOAD SHOWS NON STOP ADS. HIJACKS PHONE SCREEN. I'M FLAGGING THIS APP TO GOOGLE PLAY. THIS APP HIJACKS SCREEN WITH APPS. DON'T DOWNLOAD. I'M GONNA SUE THE SIT OUTTA THEM"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Your Mom"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible, shows ads every few seconds, minimal features, no layer support, no project support, complete waste of time. This is the Microsoft Paint of image editors."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I LOWERED your rating to the lowest possible. I'd give it a zero if I could. I edited something, went to save it and an add popped up THAT REFUSED TO GO AWAY!! I will be deleting your useless app. Take it and shove it where the sun don't shine. I'm done."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Annoying pop up ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but it's full of bugs now. Text freezes on screen and there's no way to save your progress. Oh well, guess you'll have to start all over! Update: Devs have absolutely ruined this app with ads and storage bugs. What a shame. Zero stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is a very good image editor ruined by nag screens from advertising and some gaming screen options???, I understand you need to make a some money out of this app, but it's a pain to use at the moment, looking for an alternative, and uninstalled, found Snapseed to be a good alternative, thanks Pixlr for the years of editing use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app since long time and that's the reason I'm not gonna rate bad here, but recently app is not working at all it crashes when before the start menu."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Love the app, but now with all the ads the experience of using pixlr has been seriously downgraded to the point I'll be looking for an alternative. Its no fun when you are about to save something you've been working on, then an advert starts which fills the whole screen, you can't stop it and then you lose your work..... Such a massive shame :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once worth 5* now its a data farming app masquerading as an image editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Imagine not including the same features as Desktop Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Skip this app. Get one without skeezy 30 second, unskippable ads, or asking you to pay a stupid amount per yer to add photo filters....... -11/10. I'm finding a different website to use too, cause WOW this app. Just wow."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great now I'm uninstalling. Plagued by ads that force you into the play store."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Picture quality always terrible after rendering. :/"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's okay. Needs a lot of work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now loaded with adverts that can't be avoided. Doesn't store photos in gallery either. How to spoil an app!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is basically a virus. It pops up ads that restart if it loses focus and there's no clear exit button forcing you to click the ad even when it's over."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until recently forces you to watch videos, this aftects any other audio or videos your currentyl wayching as well.. bad idea, just uninstalling now... Good luck"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using this great app for years and now I'm done. Suddenly they have put adds on after every time I finalize an image and save it. It's no longer worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Couldn't save due to ads spazzing the process."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since my recent review was deleted: As a ""free"" app it has way too many ads. They double as you get two ads. Worse thing is trying to do a color fill on type. You can only do one letter at a time then save it it but the next letter the controls go beserk and you can't see the color you're trying to pick. I'm sure there are better apps so I'm leaving and ""NO"" I don't want to contact support for this. **And why when my device works with many other APPS you say ""it could be my device""?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"غولن آس"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very annoying Ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Pretty good, good options works really well really helps with my photography work I've got a few apps of this sort this is for sure a keeper"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but now they added ads & stuff & this really ruined the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great app, but the final ad when saving a file is now deeply aggravating. Even after letting the ad run, it's hard to get back to the app, you find yourself in Google Play. Very, very poorly executed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be fine before they tripled down on ads. Now they spam you harder than retirees phones during medicare sign up when you go to actually save something. So much so that I could not save what I created rendering the app completely useless unless you wanna spend your life watching ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect ✨🚶🏻‍♂️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Real photoshop"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best app on the market now it's basically adware"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Due to the comments about ads becoming more obnoxious, this app has made the list - the ""Do not update"" list."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editing app for Android. Like someone else mentioned, I have also been using it for years. The effects are good and in my opinion the app has an adequate amount of options and delivers great results. Definitely recommend."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This aap shows ads during Data On ( internet) but if i run this aap without internet or without Data or in Airplane Mode✈️. No ads showing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads in this app are ridiculous and incredibly intrusive. Instant uninstall after trying to save one image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow y'all really ruined this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Does not allow resize with free aspect ratio which is something pretty simple and normal on a desktop"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Developers now deleting my review it seems. 2/10 app now downgraded to 1/10. Absolute sham used to be such a good app and Dev team now it's obvious they don't care"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this. But you're wrecked it with all the ads. You are makeing us pay monthly not to have the adds. I will go elsewhere now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it and am upgrading to premium!!! (FIRST app I have EVER changed to Premium WHATSOVER!!)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was so good before....but now creepy ads ......nothing to do but have to uninstall it!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after first edit, I couldn't even save without getting endless ads. I know y'all need to get paid for your work but this is a trash attempt."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I loved this app for 2 years, but now I'm moving onto to a new photo editor The incessant facebook ads are insane! I can exit them and they run on and one for a loooooong time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be my go to photo editor. Now they have put the awful ads before you can save. So there goes pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Used it for years. Thanks for that. But new, aggressive ads keep sending me to play store and I can't skip them but worst of all, seem to get stuck and can't get back to save and upload my photos. Driving me nuts. Too dramatic a change to cope with. Sadly uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lackluster compared to other free photo editing apps. I've been a user for years and they haven't added anything new at all... except ads. Ridiculous. I'm uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to use this app so often for just little things here and there.. but after all these ads started showing up I can't even save a picture anymore. I get at least 4 ads every time I try to save an image, and when I click out of the ad it takes me to the download page anyways then I lose my progress in modifying the picture I was trying to modify. Can't save a single picture anymore.. I would absolutely not recommend this app. Try photoshop express instead. Does the same thing just better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after the new intrusive ads on saving pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Totally unusable due to an endless loop of ads that cannot be closed without losing your edited image. I don't know why Pixlr keep giving feedback to the 1 star reviews saying 'try again' - this problem has existed for 2 months and still not fixed. Not worth paying for ad-free due to major loss of image quality when resizing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free version is absolute garbage now!!!! Used to be great, now it is unusable. Can'escape the worthless adds for useless garbage. Can't save because you can't escape the advertising sewer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads out the freakin wazoo. Worse than. ANY app I have ever had; ever."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used to be great app. Too many ads now. Update. Paid for ad free and I'm very satisfied."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was an excellent app. I paid for it years ago. Now suddenly there's tons of ads. I see no need to pay for a subscription to use an application that I've already paid for and been a good customer of. I've supported this app for years and now you want me to pay a monthly or yearly fee regardless of how little it may be it's just ridiculous. Thanks but no thanks! 😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is great but OMG so many f*@#*+ ads it annoying. I have free apps with less ads or more settle not inconvenient."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it's better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I want it to be my ""go to app"" It needs a grid onto the background to ensure things are symmetric, also the keyboard popping up and covering half the editing page gets in the way. The user should be able to press on and off if needed (yes theres an arrow to drop it down when it pops up but it keeps popping up when it wants to! Also when saving font the quality is really bad creating pixels in my text for my business logo.you think it looks great then click that tick box it pixelated. Please fix"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice amajing app 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺ 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update means the adverts block the controls to edit photos 😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wrost experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been a long time user and while I understand the need for monetization, the ads are too intrusive. Uninstalling after this review."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is a surprisingly powerful app that I've been using over the past four years. The double exposure feature is especially fun when used in conjunction with a background eraser. The filters, stickers, and overlay options are a lot of fun. The biggest drawback as others have pointed out is the ads that play when you save your work. I understand why they're there but I'd like to see a better implementation of ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but it no longer saves to a folder I can find even though I went in to change the settings. It also freezes and crashes. Also, I don't mind ads if it's free but the ads on this app take too long."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, used it for all my image needs on my outdated phone running Android 9. I have a new phone running Android 11 now, and they literally force me to give their app my phone data or I'm kicked out of it. Yeah, I'd rather not use it. All an app like this needs to ask for is storage access to save the images, anything else is a no-go — no exceptions. Based on your recent reviews too, I'd say you've shot yourselves in the foot."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"a shallow form of it desktop couterpart"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"AMENDMENT to Previous Excellent Rating ***UPDATED*** A waste of time now, annoying advertising interruptions, unable to exit, Third Party Advertising redirects me to Google Play, Interrupting my exit from the App...An annoying app now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I 💕 love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just uninstalled. Tried to edit photos and app closed without saving."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, across 4 different phones. Sadly had to delete the app today and I will not be returning. It's become too bloated with ads. I just cannot stand having three ads pop up when I'm just trying to save the photo to my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app really good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"irritating advertisement"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Been very impressed by this app since 4 years back. Now it has also joined the intrusive Ad league. They don't seem to realize that the pre Ad versions were the best Ad for the App and many would buy the premium version. But greed has no limit. Do not update the pre Ad version otherwise get ready to uninstall, unless you enjoy watching the ads you see all day long in the other apps one app more."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They added giant obtrusive ads and hide the x until after the video has played."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've had this for years. It still works well--until you try to save--then the ads seize control of the phone! Deleting now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"CHANGE YOUR NAME TO ADPXLR I WAS EDITING A PHOTO AND WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO SAVE, AN AD APPEARED AND SUDDENLY ALL MY EDITS ALSO DISAPPEARED. SENSELESS AD"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are terrible. They are inescapable videos that if look for an exit button they take you away requiring you to watch more ads! Terrible terrible terrible. Just use snapseed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Calm down with the ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Really evil pop up ads on the free version. Try working on something for hours and then trying to save it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I was looking for a pixel editor. This is not it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Too much ads, every time you save Crop is inconvinient Does not have quality reduction ---"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is a fantastic app. Not much of a tutorial for beginners. I'm sure they will figure it out though. Great picture quality. Lots of fun things to choose from."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads 👎🏻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was very good app b4, nw it's getting too late save a picture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Retrieving data from user."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Images are getting stored in com.pixlr.express folder and cannot be seen in the phone gallery"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Won't let you save photos to photo album only a file a d then file says not found."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Whoever made the decision to add the ads has made the wrong decision. Get rid of that person. You'll lose customers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bought this a couple years ago, used it often, it was a quick n easy interface. Then they went to ads ads ads or an expensive subscription (8$ a month). So much for having 'bought' it from them previously. Now I have to pay monthly or there are 30 second forced-play ads just to crop and save a Single pic? Up yours pixlr, you can lixlr your own dixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app...along time the adds ads overwhelming makes the edits not worth it. It's one ad after the next after the next they keep popping up. It's literally 3 game ad apps in a row its long and takes the fun away from this app so disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be a wonderful app but the new monthly subscription model coupled with the ridiculous unskippable ads makes this an instant uninstall for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The developer has responded to my review by saying the ads are ""to help them maintain and upgrade their Mobile applications"". Thank you for your response, I understand totally and I'm willing TO PAY FOR THE APP. IT'S A GOOD APP. Just give me/us the option of paying for it so we can get rid of the annoying ads please 🙏🏼"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads kill it for me, not usable anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"can not save pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thanks You Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I use to love this app but with the new updates and ads, I feel like it's a lot slower. Lots of bugs where I have to constantly close the app because it freezes. Also the advertisement is annoying and takes so long to be able to exit out of."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've loved, praised & recommended this app for years & literally use it daily. Upgraded my phone yesterday & this was my first & most important app to download. I'm so destroyed that about 16 of my favorite fonts which I use repeatedly have been removed. Tried removing & re-downloading the app but to no avail the fonts still are not there. The missing fonts were replaced by the same TYPE font so there are multiple selections with the same boring TYPE font. This is a complete disaster."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a really great app until all the ads popped up. I have no desire for games, sorry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app totally reccomend!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ditto on the intrusive ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Adverts prevent use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ripped apart by ads!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive adds all over the place. Good for a quick edit of your camera photographs. Recently it is acting like a virus. Uninstalled!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are almost unbearable. EDIT: no i won't buy a premium membership for 759 glumbocoin per week or whatever. I'm not paying you for the privilege of not having ads that you can't skip through and FORCE you to go to the play store before closing. Not gonna happen, Jack."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Constant aggressive-ads. I used this app for years now I'll never use it again. Pixlr, don't even bother with a response on this idgaf."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"So so"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for so long, but what?! I just noticed that the ""Spot"" heal produces a blue box on the spot after the file gets exported. Please fix!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have used this for years and loved it. Recent ads have made it unstable. Will not give in to hostage tactics when this app takes over my phone with ads that will not close. Will not purchase. WILL return to Google Play to warn others before deleting this app.. so sad, I will miss it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good app but it has been taken over by ads that take to long to play as you try to download your edited photos Update: I find it insulting to be told to subscribe to the subscription plan when I am disabled and on a fixed income. These intrusive ads, that last longer than 30 seconds before you can close them to be able to save your work is going to drive people away"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was great but now spoiled by excessive advertising. Difficult to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was one of my favourite apps but it is impossible to save now as an advert pops up full screen and there is no X to close the advert. Any touch of the screen redirects you to google play to encourage you to install the app being advertised. Clicking back just takes you to the advert again and there is no way of saving the picture you created. It's an endless loop of advert, google play, advert, google play. So I have had to install as the app is now unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"30+ seconds for an obnoxious ad just to save a photo is ridiculous... Two types of free.. community supported or ad ridden. Take a guess which one Pixlr is.... Would honestly have a lite version with basic features, minimum ads and a pro version that's feature rich with no ads but requires an upfront purchase..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app was great until they added video adds, its insufferable now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Won't stop crashing, I keep losing all my progress and it's wasting my time. Also whenever you save your work to you device the quality always drops so it looks pixelated and terrible. Wish I could give it no stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Like many others, I used this for years as my go-to editor. The ads have made me give up on it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once it was excellent app. I'm working with the app since last 8 years. But now a day adds disturbing and taking much more time. Really Ridiculous."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are locking up the app, giving you a permanent black screen that can't be closed or backed out of, and Pixlr has become completely unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are painful. I've used this app for years, and wanted to buy an ad-free version but it's not an option so I think I'll explore changing apps, sadly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What is with all the frign adds lately!! You make one adjustment, add. Try to save, add! Start new edit, add. ! Add add add !!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I didn't mind a few ads... but now it's made useless by those. Obnoxious, loud, annoying, and absolutely not interesting stuff I do not, will not, and now am most discouraged from ever downloading or buying! Uninstalling PIXLR. (And any other app that lets greed override common sense.)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app almost every day but now I have to delete due to the obnoxious full screen, non closeable ads. I try to exit out of them and it just takes me to the app store to download the app shown in the ad over and over and I can't save the photo I've edited because I have to force close the app to get the ad to stop playing. Why would you ad this horrible feature to this app??? Edit: you say you've fixed the ads but I just tried to save an edited photo and it's the same. Stop lying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing and the ads are now completely unavoidable. Ads seem to cause the app to crash and they take up the entire screen. What used to be a great app has been getting progressively worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my go to photo until the recent change to painfully long ads. I now use Snapseed. So much better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Popup complains about paypal can not turminate, try to login into some trading software, might have Malware catious !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was once great. Now it's absolute garbage. This app is a MASTER CLASS of what NOT to do."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Adds don't close. Horrible. Would be great app if the adds closed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too much advertising, very aggressive take over ad when you finish."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I changed from 5 stars to 1. Since the last updates the ads are so invasive that you can't save anymore, nor share to another app. They pop out and then they force you to install it. No way to go back and save. Awful! And now useless! If you thought you resolved the issue: NO IT ISN'T! IT ISN'T SOLVED, N I DON'T FEEL LIKE CONTACTING YOU VIA EMAIL AFTER I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE ISSUE!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very worst nowadays"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This App Doesn't Have Undo Option And Undo/Redo Option Necessary For An Editing Software/App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"FF khal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app is qood but ads are coming frequently"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was the best app simple and clean, thanks for destroying it with ads and ""in app purchases"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"...even though the app is free, the ads currently became extremely obtrusive when trying to save a picture, it's terrible!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not deserve on play store"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious advertising makes this app nearly unusable 😕"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used this app for many years, I'm only using it for one or two features so I'd gladly pay a one time fee I don't want to pay a subscription - I already have enough of those. Now with the ADS it is impossible to use. Adios!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm very old user of pixlr but now ads services really very bad no option for skip add even if we install that app which they force us to install after installation there's no option for skip that ad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be good. Now so many annoying ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great app, been using it for years. The recent implementation of intrusive advertisements before you can save your work is truly awful. Pixlr claims that you can close them after 5 seconds, but generally you can't. You have to wait over 30 seconds to close the ad, and often when clicking on the X to do so, it will instead take you to the PlayStore to the ad page. I understand that you need to make money, but you're driving users away. You won't profit from uninstalls and 1 star ratings."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Delete my response and now im giving a 1 star , pathetic service"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have to watch 15 seconds add for saving my Pic? No thanks, bye bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Innumerable adds"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads block me from saving my edited pics. Every time I try to save, ANOTHER AD POPS UP! I had to uninstall this app! And having to pay a monthly fee to remove ads is downright ridiculous! I'm not for this AT ALL. Save yourself from swimming through a sea of ads to edit your photos. You're better off looking elsewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great App, Totally Over the Top With Adds. What used to be a completly acceptable level of adds as - from about a month ago - become something completing annoying and time consuming. Also they're kinda ""tricky"" adds with multiple screens like some annoying guy at the store asking three times ""you're sure you don't want to buy this?"". Considering other options. Used to really enjoy using it. Thanks!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I used to use the Pixlr website for editing, which has a lot more options than the app. The app is still very good tho, which is why I'm giving four stars. However, some things I'd love to see are adding photos on top of each other, having more control over what color to choose, and tweaking lightening and darkening pictures to where you don't have to enter and exit the tool to make it darker/lighter. Good app regardless!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads have become so invasive that they're breaking the app mid edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my favourite app for many years, but the Ads are soooooooo long. I appreciate it's a business and you have to make money, but I wouldn't recommend Pixlr to anyone now. Goodbye 👋"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My go to app for years. Ads didn't bother me: in fact, it was reassuring to see an ad because it meant my picture saved. The problem is not the ads, the problem is when they are 5 minutes long, unskippable and sound. Feels like I am on one of those ""water sorter"" games. This completely ruins it for me. It cheapens app so much. I'd pay a £5 fee for lifetime use of the app. Not a monthly subscription. Thank god for snapseed. Il"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used this app for a long time and always rated it highly. Recently you are forced to watch ads before you can save work. Very annoying, I've started using other editing apps recently."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Toooooooooo much of ad... Worst ever app. I ever used..!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ad after ad after ad. Don't mind a few. But ones you can't even get rid of?? . Used to be good. Now I've had to uninstall it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads do NOT close after 5 seconds or so. And in fact 2 ads pop up. One right after the other. I don't mind seeing some ads like it was for years. The new ads are overwhelming. And app crashes often. Very often. I used to love this app. And no, it's not worth some crazy subscription. It should just be a one time purchase. And understandably in app purchases if need be. But, that's it. So sad to have had to delete this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was a great App But now Ads are disturbing!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous ad walls. Not worth it. I used this app for several years and it was great, but suddenly it's gone to trash. Not to mention it not longer allows me to save anything. Don't bother!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The save button has stopped working it just plays videos and then deletes the picture I worked so hard on"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Real nice - developer gives middle finger + ""subscribe if you don't like it"" reply. Full screen video ads take over my entire phone. I cannot press any buttons, back out, or swipe to another app. Can't even press my Home button. Any click/swipe anywhere on screen (even Back, Recent Apps, and Home buttons!) forces an unwanted click on the ad & opens other apps on my phone. This behavior is completely unacceptable; forcing people to click full screen ads by taking over their buttons is unethical."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"From 5 stars to one... Sad to see one of the best mobile photo editor dropping it's quality. Full of bugs, crashes and sometimes unusable. Edit: even after 1 year and a half they cannot fix the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"We don't mind ads but the app takes very long to laod"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using Pixlr for the better part of 5 years. You are killing this app. Please remove the super invasive video ads and go back to banner ads. You are ruining the user experience, and it makes me not want to buy the premium version to support you. Stop deleting negative reviews and listen to your install base."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The developer has become a bit sketchy. Tons of annoying ads that take you to the Play Store. Consider this before installing this app, but I would avoid it, a shame since it was good before."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Excessive bombardment with advertisements after every click and tap, for anything and everything you try to do. There is no possibility to pay for a lifetime license, because the developer decided to bleed customers dry ad infinitum with recurring subscription fees, which after two years amount to more than the most expensive competitor product costs to buy. Guess what consequently replaced this milkingware? Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I keep getting warnings about not having paid. I don't know why this is, as my payment info has not changed. RecenyI got an updated debit card, but I've been getting this message for many months before that. Now I'm being told this is my final warning. What can I do? edit: great job handling that situation. i paid for the premium version, continued to pay when you switched to a subscription model, and now you can't even be bothered to *take my money* i'm through."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The adds on the free version are a bit overboard. It is making it impossible to use the app. It even interrupts sometimes more than once when I am trying to save a photo. It is continuous and opens up all sorts of tabs on my phone. From religion (I am atheist) , FB (which I already have) to games (which I never play). The adds go on forever. I understand the need for adds but the way it is done now makes it most unpleasant as almost each photo I edit is interrupted which is too much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Use this app since 2017, its easy to use and incant move to other app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I deleted then repeated and now it works"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use it mainly for cropping images and some of its free fonts and frames. Not my favorite app, but still very useful. Edit: It used to be great! Like so many others are saying, they now force ads on you even once you've shared your work to another app. And when you try to go back, you have to start from zero. Very annoying! Look elsewhere!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"تطبيق فقير جدا"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App won't even open anymore. The ads are out of control. Edit: They only care about the fact that I commented on ads and not that the app doesn't even open. Don't waste your time with this app and find something else. I already uninstalled this app and will not give it another chance based on that response. The app itself does not open."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow way to ruin one of the best photo editors with unskippable without clicking and opening ads you absolute nailed it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"By far, my favourite mobile photo app. Until the adverts hijacked my phone. Uninstalled! Thankyou for your response. I get it, however my limited use doesn't justify the spend. If the idea of creating inescapable ad-loops was to deter us freeloaders, you nailed it! I will continue to recommend Pixlr to my contacts, but only if they intend to pay."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are too intrusive and make this app unusable. It used to be wonderful but now I'm on the hunt for an alternative. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The startling loud and intrusive ads have ruined this app. I've had to navigate through multiple windows to the point at which I've lost my work. The last ad was some young girl singing about sex and body parts. No more..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Absolutely 💯 love this app!!!!! I make memes stickers funny wallpapers all kinda $#@%#%$ stuff!!! GET THIS APP! It's legit 👌~ me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pop up ad to much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just upgraded my phone. Same account. I PURCHASED the app before the subscription service came on the scene. I just went to use it and it is ad full. Why is this. Did I mention I PURCHASED the app. I understand you need to make money but this is not kool. Thank you for the response but now it says I don't have a purchase. Still don't work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app until recently that I haven't been able to save my work. I will try reinstalling but I don't know if I can trust it anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"bhot ala"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, now its all locked behind a SUBSCRIPTION paywall. 🖕🖕"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used and really liked this app even with the ads but no more. They are SO intrusive now and I will not subscribe to an app like this. I would be happy to make a one time purchase with limited updates but this is not a ""service"" type app. Subtracted 1 star for the lame response from the development team. Read what I wrote, I'm NOT expecting anything for free. It's no longer an issue though, as the app is uninstalled so there is no ad revenue generated from me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its a free app, so not much to expect, but besides some filters this app is even surpassed by the infamous Microsoft Paint. And thats kinda disappointing, I can't even make a surface white since there is simply no option for it. Uninstalled"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app, but now I find myself getting extremely frustrated with the ads interfering with what I am trying to do! *Added after developer comment: I understand why ads are there. I am not stupid. What I don't like is when they actually interfere. *uninstalled*"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"EDITING, again! Adios Pixlr, I'm leaving you. Our 5+ years have been great but now you've become totally abusive, you're making me watch 2 full adds before I can save my work! Or to pay $12 USD a year! For a basic photo editing app?!! Well there are plenty of fish in the sea. Adiós I'm going fishing somewhere else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to absolutely loved this app for months. Then they came out with the new updates that makes you click 3-4 times to skip/close the ads. They also made the fonts blurry to hell."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years. Loved it for so many reasons, even though it's limited in its ability to edit superimposed images and blur/blend sections. I understand apps need to make money, but the new feature of forcing users to watch long ads or lose their work is intrusive and frustrating. Surely there's a better way. Guess it's back to Photoshop. 😫"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this photo editer But not working this app in my mobile Why.. This problam come recently in 6.7 months back Not working in rhis app in my mobile please give me replay what problam"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"SkAsjf Rana"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Thought it would be like the old PC version but nope, it just sucks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was the best app for me before the update. But now there are too much ads even when editing. Completely disappointed. These experience forced me to uninstall this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after years, it's entirely possible to have an ads experience that isn't this intrusive and annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is still the best free photo editing/art app on my device. Been using it since 2015 and still yet to find one I like better. Only criticism would be to update the fonts, they're kinda dated looking, and having an option for a backdrop/outline for said fonts, but aside from that, I'm pretty happy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favourite editing app. Now it's full of adds and spam. Going in the trash now. Way to ruin an app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I experieced over 26 ads just for kne 462x462 image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was good, now ads make it unusable. Uninstalled it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't work. Don't waste your time trying to edit anything because it's just gonna delete your progress."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Adverts are ridiculous now. 3 or 4 moronic mobile game ads when you try and save an image. Unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Guess I'm deleting this app I've used for forever now due to time consuming ads. Don't have time for them. Edit to their reply: I can't even save a picture without an ad getting in the way. Nor in this time of a worldly shitshow can I afford to pay for a photo app. I'll find another. Thanks for understanding....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The whole experience has gone terrible. Nothing is worrying even with latest update. Ads just keep bombarding and you really can't save or edit or preview much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to love use this app. Now it sucks. The ads, REALLY!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the fix! Love this app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are super aggressive. Completely unusable now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not free constantl ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixkr was my GO TO / RIDE OR DIE photo editing app for years. I loved it so much and bought the pro version immediately. But then the new owners switched to a subscription based pro version and stopped honoring my past pro purchase. and no option for a one-time lifetime purchase. The ads make what was quick and super easy editing a complete nightmare and ive found better apps, with MORE OPTIONS (and far cheaper) than this once great app. A once great app ive unistalled. So sad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was good before. Recently it compels us to download one game app each and every time we go for editing. Unable to save without downloading new app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is a great app to relax and play around with. It has all kinds of fun things to do and its user friendly. Until now it won't stop crashing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to really enjoy the app but now it is impossible to complete a simple edit without extensive adverts that don't allow you to complete any work. Sadly disappointing since it was so good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, but much like everyone else the ads (WITH SOUND) are unbearable, unskippable and I've lost images multiple times when I have eventually got back to my image to try and save it. I used to love this app, but why as a causal user would I want to pay for a subscription on something that has made my user experience so awful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I purchased the license to remove the apps few years ago, I changed my phone couple weeks ago and now can't retrieve the purchase, tried to contact the developer via email, Instagram with no response from them, what disappointed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The forced ads when saving have effectively ruined this once-great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its sad that after using this app for such a long period of time now i have to give 1 star , ads were okay as we are using this for free and developer team also need something to keep it updated but now not working in offline is such a bummer for me , from always number 1 editing app to uninstall it, what a journey!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once it was a very good app.. now annoying ads started creaping in while saving.. now this app is worst.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"boss"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After using this app for 5+ years I am now uninstalling. The ads are completely ridiculous."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Should be able to pick a Color and pixlate smaller to repair images. Bye now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"AVOID! Now swamped by adds. I understand that the app has a right to show advertising to those not paying, however Pixlr stops users exiting the app when showing adverts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have decided to uninstall Pixlr. The ads became so obtrusive that I could no longer use the app. I tried to pay the subscription but the ads blocked me from paying. What a joke! I went to play store to pay The subscription but on reading numerous poor reviews decided that after 10 years or so, it's time to quit on Pixlr. Dumb marketing all round guys."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app just some time the advertising blook the process"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This has been my go to app for years, I even still use it even though some of the commercials can be invasive but they have to make revenue. For some reason the new update keeps causing the app to freeze up then restart so I keep losing modified images while in the middle of working on them. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app so we will see if it works out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to love the app, yes that had to change platforms to run on but leaving out the options that made it the best (like adding photos, removing backgrounds, having a history brush) it truly felt like a pocket Photoshop. I miss it :/"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was a good app. Can't save your work now. Pretty much worthless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads now take over the phone. Suddenly hardly usable. It is a real shame but I'll find an alternative as I do a lot of photo editing and being caught in an unstoppable ad loop is not acceptable in an age of malware etc. Way to kill a great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"how am I supposed to enjoy the app when I spend X amount of time editing photos just to find out they haven't saved since fall of last year."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I understand the need for ads. I really do, but this is just too much. Guess its time to find a new app for collages and text, not that i used anything else. And a yearly/monthly subscription only... not my cup of tea."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I LOVED this app. It was my go-to for everything editing, but recently, the ads have been ridiculous, annoying and a total turn off using this app. Quite disappointed tbh cause I genuinely don't want to replace the app but I might have to now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They've removed SO MANY WONDERFULfonts, I used to use them for my logos n branding! 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to work.. Now any collage save first video (long and long) then stuck at 33%"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, untill the redundant and difficult to navigate away from Facebook ads were added. I already have FB, don't need an ad for it, don't need to spend literally 4 minutes trying to get back to the app to save my edited image after being forced to navigate around the ads. This will be uninstalled if it continues"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but recently totally ruined by ridiculous full screen ads. There are competing apps available that are just as good without such obtrusive adverts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for a long time but now it's unusable. The adds are timed,which I get, but once time is up there's no way to close the add anymore! No x to click send you can't touch the screen or it opens the add. I gotta search for something new and I'm bummed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Lose the ADS!!! It's a Flipping Nightmare now!!! Our entire photo group will be deleting your app until this is rectified!!! Wake Up Pixlr🤬🤬😮‍💨😮‍💨🤔🤔🤔 Got your message that the situation was fixed but it still interupts the editing and saving of images after completion!!! NOT Good Pixlr... You're losing a major group of photographers here!!! Please Rectify this issue sooner than later! Thank You 📸😎🌛"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Really well written app shame the ads make it unusable uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, now the adds lock you for minutes non stop. its terrible"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be a decent app for doing simple edits. Recently the ads have however become obnoxious. I just had an ad for an action game blast at full volume eventhough my phone is on ""Do Not Disturb"". Very embarrassing. They are also doing some dark patterns with GDPR data collection permission. I had to press multiple buttons and discard several pleas, and I still don't know if I successfully objected to personal data harvesting or not. This actually makes the app noncompliant under GDPR. 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wait a minite Orang Sebelah Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This has ALWAYS been my #1 go to for photo editing and although I don't mind ads (and fully understand the reasoning behind them) using this app has become beyond frustrating! An ad (and the very same one at that) after everything that I attempt to do (not even finish) is excessive. BTW... I've noticed your response on other reviews saying that this issue has been resolved... I'm going to tell you that as of today it has not been resolved so please don't try to tell me otherwise."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Thank you for resolving a lot of the issues, such as 'blur' and some others with the new update. Also need to thank your team for your prompt and efficient responses to my emails. Unfortunately, the app keeps lowering the image quality a great deal, which is indeed a factor to consider when picking a photo editing app. I wish Pixlr could be like before, when it was just top notch and flawless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Won't let me change data settings. Everytime I click ""let me fix that"" it sends me in circles, seems there's no option but to allow them to be invasive."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads make it literally impossible to use. I get why you have ads but because of them the lower screen is not accessible making the app not useable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was good. Ads ruined it. I have uninstalled it after years of use and tried other apps. I can now highly recommend ""GridArt"" (I have no affiliation). I don't care if Pixlr say the ads help them maintain it, they are WAY too intrusive and you have to kill the app when the videos pop up, without having done the picture altering that you opened Pixlr for! I've got other apps that have ads but they don't limit my ability to use the app like these ads do."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Really enjoy the app. Would like to see landscape support for my Nokia T20 Android tablet."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالی"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Please add the Ukranian flag to the overlay flag options. Great app otherwise"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"(edit: trying and liking InShot Inc's ""Polish photo editor Pro"") Pixlr was my go-to editor for many years (2016??), but now that video ads have taken over, I'm going elsewhere. Nothing worse than sitting through 4 wait screens PER AD only to find collages I made are all stretched- not that bugs are a deal breaker for me. However: greedy, annoying, time wasting ads, IN ADDITION to the old ads, ARE! Edit: redone the collages 5 times now with the same bug every time. Actually HAVE to go elsewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update bombards you with video ads. This used to be my go-to app. The banner ads were ok, but these full screen video ads with no way to back out are outrageous. Going with Adobe express."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, this app has fallen off. I support ads, but there is a limit. 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The last couple months your commercials got out of hands you really think by getting the app stuck from 1 to 3 minutes it is going to make me watch your advertisement? well guess what I will uninstall it. I have Pixlr close to ten years I understand you have to make money but not on my expense"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Im changing my phone..after i install this app at my new phone..i really upset because this app not function like before..many ads at this app.. Now i think, i want to uninstall and not use this app again.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this is the best editor i discovered so far. period. it has a lot of features that other companies claim that their application is ""professional"", yet alone how difficult the other editors are, and this app has everything i need for my editing WITH easy usage, i am really happy of this application and would look forward for more updates."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's so bad,I want to give it a 0. But that's not possible,so imma give it a 1"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App has Fullscreen ads that lock the screen, any button only leads to the ad's download link even after waiting for ad to timeout"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Has the App been hijacked by botspammers or something? Now there's a full screen pop up every time the app is opened trying to get you consent to device data sharing. Whoever wrote it doesn't even seem to be aware of the type of application Pixlr is: ""we are going to continue improving our game with your device data. Specifically, we will use your device data to optimize the gameplay mechanics, application stability, and to show relevant ads. Thank you for playing our game."" How about NO?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good to Terrible addpocalypse at its finest Was a great app till they jumped on the band wagon of being bombarded with adds Update your app and turn off the disgusting adds for sakes of not being sell outs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Jesus CHRIST the ads. I had this app for literally less than 5 minutes, yet I kept getting ad after ad. I couldn't even save the photo I was working on, it was so bad. Very horrible app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"For no more updates that is provided you found it necessary on last so called update to add a series of adds during the save process. This app used to be one of my favorites to use, but now, not impressed anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my go to for photo editing. Too many ads. Will find have to find another."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"i used to love this app, spent 5+ years using it, have even used this app to draw digital portraits etc for my art business but now it either crashes or when you finish a step it pixilates it instead of just leaving it how it looks i uninstall and reinstall numerous times, it works for about 5 steps then thats it. so sad this was great to use then they had to go and mess with it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Don't"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I keep trying to edit literally the first picture I wanted to try and I keep getting kicked out of the app. There is no apparent reason for this. I wouldn't recommend, as I cant even edit any pictures on this software without being booted. 1/10"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The only comlaint I have is it would be really helpful if they had a stroke and shadow option for text!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Been the go to app for as long as I remember, but the recent change in advertising is so intrusive I'm looking for a replacement. What was a simple and efficient process is now a 5 minute wait through ads for spammy, terrible games."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled since the ads no longer allow you to save your edits at all, without downloading some stupid game nobody asked for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb 👌👌👌👌👌👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Literally unusable app because of ads, dont waste your time with this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ruined by irritating ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using it for many years but lately it have all this ads popping up it's annoying"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Annoying adds."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I found out that it has been downgrading the quality of the pics when I use this editor, whenever is a more resolution pic and even takes a second to load on my phone,"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm back in"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Adds are absolutely ridiculous... you trying to save a photo then have to wait for 3 adds, you save the photo and one mor add is popping out then it's pushing you to play store to download something you never wanted. No matterhow many times you hit back buttonit won't work... control sad act freaks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As soon as the literal 5 minute Wordscapes ad comes up [that you can't get out of] I uninstalled. Sad to see it go, been using Pixlr for years. That ad was rediculously long just to edit a photo. Had me sitting in my car for another 5 mins just to resize a photo that should have taken 5 seconds."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"free.. means free. listen. ""start 3 day free trial"" is not free. ad blocking even the first photo i edit is not free. your at best a liar.. and at worst a scammer... 1 star because i cant give 0 punk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unskippable ads. Can't even mute. Moving to something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New ads are way too intrusive and can't be muted. Shame, this was a solid app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's not the adds that drive me crazy...it's the constant app crashing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The image was ridiculously blurry after saving. All that work to get the image the way I wanted it was completely wasted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very helpful thank u..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now inundated with ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Was going to give a 1 star rating , later see a update, it was then sorted and corrected."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years. I don't mind the occasional ad, but these ads are relentless and annoying and in no way shape or form are they interesting to me. If Pixlr paid for an taegeted ad algorithm, they got ripped off."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All ads. The ads are made in Photoshop... I wonder why?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It no longer saves as new photo, which it keeps overwrite the original photo..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and have many choices for templates and social media post design. Tq."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Boo your ads are shite"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be my go-to editor, but the ads have been getting more and more obtrusive. For example, some video ads have a (very tiny) x in the corner. And even clicking the x still opened the ad link."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Couldn't do anything with this app . Waste of time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, now intrusive ads spoil it completely. Can't share to app from photo either."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I just want to be able to do very simple things like cut and paste. This can't do that"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favourite photo editing app but now it's overrun with adverts. And after the copious adverts finish the app crashes. Unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Please stop the ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Still having issues with the adverts on this app. Especially the Tick Tok and the Facebook Add. It's really annoying. Yet your team have supposed to of fixed this issue.?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Uninstalled due to too many over-intrusive and really annoying ads for games I'll never be interested in downloading."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app, but now you have to watch a one minute long video before you can save. I understand you need to make money but these are excessive. I don't mind watching for about 10 seconds, but not a minute. There are plenty of other apps that can replace you, so before you lose more subscribers, hence lose people to watch your ads, you guys need to revisit the idea of running one minute long video ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm using from last few years.. now after last update in brightness filter, it's very bad. Please revert brightness update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Always crashing, never can save photos. used to be great. needs bug fixes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for year's. Had to uninstall due to aggressive pop-up ads you cannot bypass which then force you to the play store. I have always been happy to pay for an ad free environment, but not a monthly subscription; especially as I only use it for the basic functions. Offer a way to remove the ads without a subscription and I will happily return."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid for no ads years ago and now there are (very aggressive) ads and when pressing the 'restore' purchase button it says “no purchase to restore”."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my all time favorite app! Now it is HORRIBLE!! The ADS hold you HOSTAGE. Non-stop. One after another, taking up the full screen on Android devices and only after half a minute does a tiny ""x"" appear on the top right. So tiny that I missed it and had to reboot my phone twice!! Disgusting! EDITED: I was pleasantly surprised to receive a very prompt response from Pixlr and I re-downloaded the app to try it out. Unfortunately the ADS bombardment continued. 8 ADS before I could save my changes. I give the app 2 stars this time but it is a far cry from what it used to be. It had reasonable amount of advertising but didn't completely overwhelm the user."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your new add policy and access to information is rubbish deleting app permanently"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app now just because of adds.. UNINSTALLING."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not sure why this was put on the list with pixart it's free for a reason terrible boring"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Many times already my meticulous photo edits have been lost right as I'm about to save them. I believe its due to a bug that initiates the ad that play before saving a file, its causing the app to crash and not save any changes. Since I can't save my work, I will be uninstalling this and looking for a suitable replacement app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Issue with saving pictures! Excellent photo editor on my old mobile phone, a 4 1/2 year old Lenovo P2 and I do not have any issues saving edited pictures. Sadly on my Asus tablet it gets stuck when trying to save a picture and the only option is to close the app and lose any work. A real pity as this is a very good app for basic editing on a mobile device and I especially like the ability to erase selective parts of any edits! Update, stupid adverts made App unusable. Deleted!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great! I have been using it for the past 5yrs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Went from easily the best photo editing app to by far the worst piece of trash app on the marketplace. Insane that devs would put so much effort into destroying their own app. Crashes every five seconds now and tons of long ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Super easy to use. Limited font options, though."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very limited all about selfies bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for a while, but after using other programs this one just doesn't seem to be able to keep up. There are no layers, so editing text is not possible, the default text is white serif, not changeable, moving objects on screen requires two fingers, as one finger will rotate instead. One finger can move objects, but it has a habit of instead roatating by an indiscernible amount, without a guarantee that it will lock back into the correct orientation."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixler has been such a great app I've used a long time for a non-profit international organization that helps people in which I volunteer. It was perfect. Now the adds interfere with my work. The font selection isn't as good as it used to be either. I'm really disappointed. It was a 4 star app, now its a 1 star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ooopp"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So I can't lighten and darken parts of a pic anymore after updating my phone .over all I love this app and use it daily. Plz fix thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It keeps error and closing the app I hope you fix it.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are blocking the program. Especially the TicTok ones. This is useless any more"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Picee"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"After the update, the fonts that I normally use have vanished."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to add an image. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Goid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Poor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app went down bad👎 ads are bs switch to something else"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best of the best .,.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It sucks...! With the new update we cant use the brightness brush tool. It itcreases the whole brightness automatically. Please corrrect this asap. This is the perfect photo editor that i have ever seen and need it back. Thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is my main editing app, I loved it for the longest time but now I can barely go 1 minute without those annoying pop up ads. I was fine with the other ads being shown because they don't interrupt the flow but when they pop up constantly and you gotta wait 10/15 seconds or so I would pay to remove ads but I feel like paying a subscription for a mobile editing app isn't worth it - just have it a one time purchase"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"👎👎👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ouch. Still a good app, but unless you've paid, their new ads block you from finishing a project unless you download Facebook. Not something I'm interested in doing, at all. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Roshan"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The blur option doesn't work. It keeps blurring the whole photo even if I click line or center. That was the best feature on there. Please fix!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The latest update solved the share ability, the apps good, not sure why the low ratings... (arm64, Android 12)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"In the last few months the app just does not work. I Cannot save the photos, or even use all the features that I could before. Would not recommend atm, although I used it for years. :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad the only bad thing about this is that when u try to make text it's getting so annoying.also the pixelated effect is way to much i put it at 1 percent and u still can't see it.When i go to my computer it's so much better can u please change it and make it look just like the pc version? Thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Please add a shadow for the font I need it for bright pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my favorite app. I used it for designing and am still trying to. But you have to remember to turn off wifi before you save your finished pattern or you will be subjected to adds for facebook ( which I hate) and other platforms. Also some of my favorite fonts have completely gone. It used to be absolutely my favorite and I was really used to it... actually I am kinda gutted that its become so obnoxious. 🙄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"FONTS STILL OT FIXED 90 DAYS LATER. ARE YOU GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COMPLAINT?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The amount of adverts that are suddenly popping up when using this app is ridiculous, I'm thinking of going over to a different editing app because of the adverts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Pefect app.I m using for lastfive years.. It is also suugested to add pic object crop tools i.e. human, birds, animals etc. any objects. Really very usefull & perfect to compose, edit, add stickers, unwanted removal tools are so friendly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"very bad, too many ads come up, and don't allow me to save my photos after a laborious editing... very sad n pethatic , please don't install this app, UNSKIPPABLE ADS"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Pixlr has always been great, but the adds have to stop. Can't save something without an add."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It is too hard to place a text letter..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Paid for the subscription yet I can't access it. Can't log in, can't restore, Sick of all the ads when I go to save photo's. Especially since paying to use it. Used to love this app. Not paying for pro again since I've wasted money on something that doesn't even work. Used to be great! Sad it's gotten to be such a mess."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Cropped images saved even on max settings have blurry text. Have used the app on iOS for years and it doesn't have the same issue that side. Was lucky enough to buy it there before the rent-to-use only (with no option to buy) era began"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been one of my favorites for years but now I can't get a single photo done because it keeps crashing. Please fix this!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very slow to save. This is the second time it's switched to ""original"" after I've spent a lot of time editing. There's no explanation. Even though it has the undo buttons showing, once it says ""original"" the undo and redo buttons have no effect. Uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WHAT A RIP OFF! This is what happens when you pay for premium access!!!!! The sticker containing the golden crown and golden stars and starbursts no longer exists!!! And you can't choose the size you save to."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years, but your ads are ridiculous now. There's so many, and you can't just skip them easily anymore. I just had 6 ads while trying to edit one image. I understand the need to earn money, but this is desperate. You're trying to force people to pay for a subscription by making their experience unbearable. I think I'll just find a new app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is my go to app for the more simple pic and photo editing jobs such as zoom, crop, rotate, add text. It is quick to open and respond, and just as quick to convert and save changes to your edited pic in whatever format you've chosen. Easiest five stars I've ever given an app 🙂 thank you @pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Bakwas ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very easy opareting pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This update killed this app. Maximum size reduced. I cannot open big pictures from gallery in Pixlr. And too many ads. Finally uninstalling after 9 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Came to the app store to uninstall and reinstall the app, and got detoured by the reviews. I also have used this app for years, but the pop up ads that won't close, on top of them just being so loud and abrupt, killed it for me. I'll spend money on ad-free software somewhere else after that nonsense."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Images are no longer saved. And to the developers, no, they're not saved in any photo albums. They are nowhere on my phone. Update: I attempted to uninstall and reinstall per developer suggestion to no avail. There are absolutely zero saved files on my phone, despite the app stating that the image is saved. This is unfortunate for the developers, since I will be uninstalling permanently."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was my go to app for editing photos for many years, but it was brutally and quite suddenly made almost unusable overnight by an update with such intrusive ads. I get how e-commerce works and have other apps that run with ads, but this is just silly and has literally broke the program."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What's with the endless ads? I understand that ads come with a free app, but endless time of being able to save edited image is bs!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sadly a once great app has become basically unusable recently - it's now blocked by really annoying intrusive video ads, so obstructive it's almost impossible to do any photo editing, and they even divert you to Google play to try and get you to install apps not even vaguely related. Gutted. I contacted the developer, who said I needed to subscribe to get rid of these bugging ads - well, I suggest they stop calling it a Free Photo Editor now, because it isn't."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was the best now video ads. Delete!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not digging the move to subscriptions - this kinda sucks as I've already dropped money for the full paid ""pro"" version some time ago and have used this app quite a bit. Now I'm getting an ad for another app on the home screen. Some of the filters and overlays are still useful to me but this app has been been slowly going downhill for a while - there's been a lot of tinkering with subscriptions and paid content but no new features or real improvements."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful app and super easy to use when you get the hang of it. I definitely recommend getting it!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Restricted the app access to wi-fi and mobile networks so now I can save my pics without obnoxious ads, just like in good old days (yesterday)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app for years. Recent update was pathetic. Added so many ads. I uninstalled now and will never use this app... It sucks 😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"May i request or suggest that if it is possible to have an attachment (picture) function that can be posted on the picture being edited."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am using this app from long time, but only one features is also required of crop-shape image for change background, because lack of this featureis also required we need to use other apps which we don't like"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be great. Now I can't save anymore (it opens 3 as in a row, then goes back to the edit screen without saving). Uninstalled & deleted from library. I will not use this app again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I updated app today and after that I can not open photos from my gallery with Pixlr. Before I did update it was working well."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was a favorite app for YEARS and has been ruined recently. Unclosable popup ads are the last straw."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be good, now full of adverts, awful! And to get rid of the adverts a subscription is needed. I hate subscriptions. Better pay once and be done."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"horrible app. Cant adjust anything at all and you get 30 second apps between using anything. Dont even waste your time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be 5 star. Now cannot even edit 1 single photo without 25 ads. Ridiculous."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have seen this app from becoming best to worst. Lots and lots of issues. Irritating adv., low performance and feature."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hi to the developers. Firstly I thank you for this super app. BUT now after the update we can't do anything on it anymore. WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THIS ??? It was PERFECT BEFORE and now its all one big mess and all users won't be able to use it. Guess you guys got bored and messed it up. Please 🙏 put it back to how it was before Thnx"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"After using for a few weeks it works the best of any photo editing program for Android."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I would have given a 'zero' star review if I could... thanks for the latest update and changes that saw you bombard me with 4 ads sequentially, without any choice to exit your app.. uninstalling.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app , for years . Now whatever adds they use make it unbearable. Deleted"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my favorite editing app but it just doesn't work anymore. Several feature appear to work, but when I save the changes it edits the entire image without any changes I made. For instance, the brightness/darkness brush looks like it works, where I brush. When I'm finished with that tool, the image is either entirely brightened or darkened rather than just being how it was edited. This isn't the only tool with that problem. Most of these tools don't work on the website."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It does not ask you for money nor make you keep watching ads every time you do one edit or cut like PicsArt"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since so many years i am using this app .. suddenly stopped working...only for payment mode .. Why so... Atleast we were using it in the least form..for editing images ...kindly do the needful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I'm going to miss this app. It seems to not save what I edit. I used this app for years and it makes me sad to move, as I got attached to the app. I hope it works better. But I'm Uninstalling for now. :((("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great before they recently filled it with ads. Can't even save a pic without being bombarded with them. What a joke."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The worst ADS ever, you are forced into watching long no way to end ADS that closing the app will not even stop. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH 2022 PIXLR This WAS a great app but now it is useless!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It is a great editor app but my suggestion is can you add chroma key for easy background erasing? I have blue and green screen, I just want to remove it easily by selecting the color to erase."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid to remove ads, but there are still ads. Their support refuses to respond. Thieves! I want my money back. Zero Stars!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ads weren't that disruptive back then, had to uninstall it... I'll miss this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"To be honest I absolutely love this app for edits. But since the new update, you can't share photos directly to the app, no you have to open the app now, search for the photo, try and edit it only for three different ads to pop up. A brilliant app ruined once again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used for year's now suddenly bombarded with adverts and unable to save why ruin a good app😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Handy, but compresses my images way too much"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to use app due to ridiculous add popups. This was my go to app for editing content. I recommended it often when asked what editing software I used... Whenever I'm saving work, I get a popup add that covers my whole screen, no way of skipping the add and a total ball ache to get back to my work to save it. What used to be an awesomely fast editing add is now completely unusable. Gg... *facepalms* time to find a new app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Hmm.. bewn using this apps , like it. But got issue with brighten brush , its seem cannot save as our modification.. its bwcome ovwrall brush effext to whole photo.. bad experience..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Used this for years, great easy app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is about as difficult to work with as most mobile photo editors, but the worst aspect here is the video ads. You're sitting at your desk at work trying to make a couple quick edits to a listing for fb, when BOOM, an unclosable video ad launches at full tilt, ear blasting volume. I don't need that on my phone. Be less intrusive shovelware and I might find you more tolerable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for about 4 years, it is great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Kinda worked.. except after editing an image & saving it to my phone.. i preas home & stupidly it made it my wallpaper which o certainly didn't ask for!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've always loved this app but I guess after the updates it won't save any photos that I edited, very disappointed....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately, this app has gone downhill. It used to be the best, but now the core functions don't even work. Tools like blur, spot heal, etc all no longer work properly. I'm really glad I didn't pay for the app subscription be sude I would be so upset to pay for something that doesn't work! Sad I have to find a replacement."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Auto colour a part of the picture is not included"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app has always been a 5 stars til 2 months ago. The last update screwed up the ""light"" and ""dark"" button. U can no longer just lighten or darken small places. If you try it does the whole picture. I'm sad I use this for all my editing. Kinda sux"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This has been my go to app for YEARS & I have also been experiencing similar results as other users in previous ratings below. Which is disheartening. Considering those were months ago. I go to use an edit on an area of a photo & it forces the edit on the entire thing. I have paid for a long time but won't be moving forward as the problem has yet to be resolved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You have NOT fixed legacy purchases. Please re-read the problem. And again an early supporter is let down. I paid for no adverts, a one off fixed amount. The app now ignores this purchase and shows adverts. Can't redeem my purchase. Thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Usually great. But certain functions within Tools, like Blur and Auto Contrast have recently become broken. If I use Auto Contrast on an image, then the erase tool to remove the effect and then the restore tool to restore it where I want it, once I accept the changes it applies the effect to the whole image. Same with the Blur tool. And probably others within that section. Please fix this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Get this app if u want to kill yourself"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very great easy work I like most"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Way too restrictive, many basic features that are on the web version aren't on the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I loved this app... some of the functions aren't working. The blur tool is one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My Go to phone editor... I have used this app on my phone for years and as I have noticed it has always been pretty much the same. It works great, especially to make fun covers for a you tube channel or a SoundCloud cover and all you have is 15 minutes to do it and only an Android to do it with this app saves the day . It's not photo shop but it's convenient and you can make some really cool things with your photos ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I cannot delete any photos from Pixlr. There is no way to access history and if I hover over a picture to delete it nothing happens."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app was a fabulous one and m using from so many days. But in the latest version brighten and darken option is not working as it used to work. Please fix it. Entire pic is being brighten not the portion i am selecting"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm getting error to save my imag so kindly solve that issue. Please I'm facing many problem because I made so many files but now pixlr don't save my Edit files"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"mid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Something is off that wasn't wrong before.. The Darken and brighter brushes don't work properly. Brush changes look ok on screen but when you hit ✔️ (the check) entire image changes light/dark."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Certain tools like the brighten and darken tool, among others, now effect the whole photo as opposed to where the edits were applied to."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I find this to be the best of it's kind."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazing app .."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No stroke for text? Dumb."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow! This is better than Adobe Photoshop CS6 Keep it up! 😉"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this is completely useless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Thanks for fixing all problems...love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This picture📸 editing✂️ app is by far 1️⃣ of the very best🏆 I have tried. And I have tried them (almost) all. I am so happy🌈😃!! It is so easy to use!!

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"UPDATE:worse Great until 2mths ago. I've used Pixlr since it's beginning, originally the desktop version. Paid for the service for years. But the app on my Samsung has been off the last few months. Tools are not working like they used to. The light and dark brush and the blur end of changing the full image rather than where applied. I came to the app store to see if it needed an update, but it does not. Are there fixes in the future for these problem tools? This was my go-to app for quick edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالیییییی"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have used the app for years, now when I use splash and click the apply tick it reverts it back to a black and white picture, hopefully this is a bug you will fix."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mast super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice up"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Why no option to resize?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The lightness and darkness brush nolonger works. I have written several detailed emails so far, to your support team and haven't had a reply. Changing the brush size to work on smaller areas used to result in selective lighter and darker areas. Photo editing was selective and much more effective than a lot of the other Photo Editing Apps. Now the same actions change the whole image. How long will it take for you to fix the 'bug'?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Been using for years and suddenly won't let me pay, in spite of trying various methods! Email telling me it would be cancelled if I didn't pay!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Nice App! We can edit/give filter or replace photo to photos with 100% quality and resolutions. Thanks Pixlr, has always accompanied and helped me in Online School🤗. Keep the best feature, Developer!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good product. There's the option to purchase and remove ads and unlock items but the transaction fails no matter the payment method and its not a Google play issue since I've been able to buy from other apps in the playstore. Frustrating for those that actually want to spend money and purchase the service."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالی با تعم پرتغالی"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great photo editing app for some quick on-the-go edits. Plenty of effects and tools to choose from. Right now the circular/line blur no longer works. As soon as I hit the checkmark it just saves it as a full blur. Once that's fixed I'll put some more stars back up"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad no option for size n quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like pixlr because you can make photos with pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be the ONLY editing app I used as a hairstylist but ever since I got my S21 Ultra nothing works. I erase a blur or a temp adjustment and then go to save it and it reverts back to what I didn't want. So sad actually bc im just going to uninstall it. It's useless to me now without the tools working."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Soheb"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was my favourite editing app for years now, but the recent update wrecked the tools. I darken a spot, and the whole photo becomes dark. I blue the background, the entire photo blurs. Please fix."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Well it's the only thing that keeps me on Tweeter or Facebook for me to distort history and prove the facts for an eyegrab to text info. It's fun but sucks up time from what I should be doing online ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Has been functional and easy to use, my favorite photo editor app by far! :)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Exactly what's needed 🏵"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like the overlays"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Do not know why, but love it. Found ease to use and fun. It misses few updates or polishing (feels outdated) but this app is (for now) the must have app on my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The app is good, comes in handy making collages and editing pictures. But it's acting weird lately, when I click in collage and choose the photos to add, the app shuts down. Please rectify the issue."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I love the app but now when I choose pictures it loads them in the wrong direction and when I double exposure it to add my logo it distorts the images so they look flat and stretched out of proportion"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best photo app but now it wont even save the photos you edit."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It wont allow me to purchare premium the app store. Is there another way i am able to purchase."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Will you fix the errors soon? I've had the premium version for many years and I loved it. The app is completely broken now. I can't even access the home settings. The app closes once I hit the home button. Also, like others state, we can't edit a portion of a photo any more. It will edit the whole photo or nothing. I'm not interested in using the web version. If you can't fix this quickly, can you at least go back to the previous version?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Loved this app but brighten/darken is now bugged (pixel 6, app up to date). Shame it was a useful feature that other photo editing apps don't tend to have."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was not enough good!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"My go to app when I need to make quick photo edits and adjustments, however the latest update to Android 12 has broken some of the features in the app, most notably the blur tool. I use the tool quite frequently to add a faux depth-of-field effect to photos; however, after the update, no matter which type of blur tool I use, whether that be radial or linear, the app always reverts to a full screen blur when I press confirm. This also causes the UI to mess up which forces me force stop the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The most convenient, most useful the best for me, super!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Been using Pixlr since the desktop version, loved it on my smartphones, I'm using Motorola G Stylus 5g (2021) now and for some reason, the subscription kept getting denied, but my previous device had many issues so I got me this new one & even though, I have just installed the Pixlr app on my new device - deleted the subscription, used a different account - doesn't matter payment is always denied. I even purchased a Google Play gift card, loaded it into my play account & payment is STILL denied!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Is very good kind photoshp if is free to I have on PC also"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Just one feature need to add ' background change' like if my background is Taj Mahal and I want to change it to Eiffel tower."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Edit your pictures very easily"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easyand simple"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i'm using this app since 2016 ~ when this app launches an update, i never tried to update it because i'm fine with the results it giving me and i don't need an update, but in 2021, i tried to update it and i can't use it offline! that's why i uninstalled it again and find a lower version. luckily i've found up to down site !! btw, thanks so much pixlr! i'll keep on using this this is so gooddd"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app many times with great success. Now it's just good for watching ads. That's literally all I can get done is watching ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal!!! I've used it for years, and came today and saw that there's an update, but, after reading the reviews, no thanks, I won't be updating, if it's not broken... so I'm perfectly satisfied with having the older version, and don't plan on changing. As is, I've been using it over 10+ years on my numerous other accounts, all android, from my tablets, to Samsung devices, my #1 choice."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the true meaning of technology at it greatness...the results speaks volume to the quality of the app."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible app! Don't waste your time and data downloading this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It played two video ads at once, causing a cacophony as I simply tried to find how to use layers. Far and away the most limited photo editing app I've used."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Many of the tools don't work correctly, I'll erase in blur then when I hit accepts it reblurs every area. It does the same the other editing options like softening, sharpening"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice and clean app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The blur feature is broken"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for a long time now and it was great. But of late when I save my work the quality reduces. At first I thought it was my phone and I tried it on different phones. I'm sure there's a bug in the app. Please fix this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Im using this app Above 5years,but templates not open..I think this app goes to very worst condition"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"That's app is awesome and i love all this feature"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What's going on with the blur or smooth feature? It won't let you save your change after you use the eraser..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app and have used it for years on my Samsung galaxy phones. It's really the only photo editing app I use on a mobile platform. I recently upgraded my phone, however, and on the latest Android systems, several of the fonts are missing, especially in the retro section. I re-installed the app, which got some of the fonts to reappear in other categories, but not in the section I mentioned. I'd be grateful if you folks could look into that! Cheers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why does is save my edited photos twice? The 2nd one always seems a bit off too, like it somehow cropped slightly, even tho I nvr crop them, it comes with the same file name just adding “ (1) ” to end of it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nicegfhhhhhhhh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love taking photographs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was great until like others mentioned I started using an S21. Tools don't work rendering the app unusable until fixed. No workarounds."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Loved it till the recent Android update. I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. As others have stated, this app was excellent. I recommended it to everyone.. now I'm glad I didn't invest the money for the premium content and won't consider it unless the tools get fixed. I will be looking elsewhere for photo editing apps soon if this doesn't get updated, which is a bummer because I loved the simplicity of use in Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When I download it it takes slow and also when it's done it just says ""install"" then it goes again"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Well, this App certain took a nose dive! Updated my device to Android 12 and the major functions I was using this app for (darken, lighten, blur, draw, etc) just don't work! Flagged the devs by e-mail and your st*pid answer was that you weren't able to replicate the issue?!? I sent you videos of what the issue was and then? SILENCE! Never heard a peep again! Absolutely unacceptable! Awarded 2 stars for the memory of what this app used to be..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Please Please fix the app! I LOVED this so much I even purchased the excelled version because I use it SO MUCH fory business. Now the lighten/darken feature sucks and does the entire photo rather than just where you apply it. TERRIBLE & BEYOND FRUSTRATING. Many glitches now.. some screens overlap or the 'tools' just disappear. Please fix... I will be finding a new app if it doesn't get resolved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent service"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't find my saved pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Decent image editing software if used as a secondary platform on a mobile phone, would not recommend as a standalone program for editing, personally I use picsart as my primary with this as a secondary because it offers a few features picsart doesn't have so"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since the desktop version of pixlr is actually quite nice i was expecting this to be at least bare minimum, but it just has no tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"***editing - after uninstall and re - install the app, all is well again 😊 Trying to change folder etc didn't help, must uninstall... *** Recently, on android, can not save image after editing , before that I was very happy with this app 😟"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I'm kinda hard to please with photo editors, but this is one of my new favorites. Clean UI, clean edits, and I can choose the save folder myself.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"degrade picture after cropping, what a mess"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's ok...I hate the part when you edited the perfect picture and then they hit you 7 day free trail."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be real good app loved to edit on it but now blur doesn't work the way it used to. It blurs the whole picture even if you erased parts of it. Supper annoying and disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Parfect application"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Greate app. Bought and paid for BUT ads have started coming thru. Please refund my money if you're going to show me advertising"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app for Android"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was uninstalled on my phone, has no subscription and then automatically helped itself to money from my bank account for an annual subscription fee. I deleted it almost as soon as I downloaded it because it was not a good editor compared to Photoshop. Be aware"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pretty good photo program with less ads for free..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No different than literally every other editing app, except this one uses your private information."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hard to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great but now sits at 50% for saving anything and never saves....so basically now, it's useless. Would have given it 5 stars previously otherwise."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Not very operational."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Useful and fun app. Previous review commented on buggyness, but recent Android update is culprit."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I just read part of lisense agreement and it reads as if you can make pretty things but have No Right to do anything with your works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for years, and it has been my go-to app for minor tweaks before posting pictures on social media. But I don't know what happened with the last update, that the photo quality has became so bad. Whenever I download a picture from Pixlr, it is so pixelated that it is painfully visible. The features are still great. But what use are the features of if you can't download a decent, un-pixelated picture?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It once was a good app. Now it constantly crashes, and certain things that worked perfectly now are suddenly buggy. I think the developers are trying to for lce you to buy a premium option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"because it wont down load"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This was a good app for years. But now, you cannot change the font color. I've tried everything including uninstall/reinstall and the font can either be black or white. Selecting any other color changes nothing which really defeats part of the purpose for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Good but you're not able to add your fonts"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to be my favorite app for the last 8 years. but after rhe last update... guess what!? it says I don't have enough space to save the photos. Completely useless!!!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It pixilates cropped paragraphs so that it's unreadable which makes you wonder what it does to photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Blur tool doesn't work. You erase the sections of the blur you want to be clear, tap the checkmark, and it takes you back to the image with the whole image fully blurred out."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Some things have changed but i still think this is one of the best editing app. Very simple to use. The only thing that need to improve is when you crop it kinda become blurry. Ive noticed the difference between other photo apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like the app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't save files anymore. Been having the same issue of it having been stuck at 50% of file saving process. Was waiting and hoping for maybe one of the updates fixing the issue eventually. Yet it is still the same story on all devices. Time to go separate ways while this app just will continue to rot. 🤙🏻 #bigsad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't know where this soft saved of edit pictures... Any software not show pictures..."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save my edits. Changed folder. Didn't help"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Super frustrating changes don't save time and time again. Installed Uninstalled re-installed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr always worked pretty good for me. Now for whatever reason, the Blur Tool is not functioning properly. Instead of being able to erase part of the blur and keep it that way, the app decides against this and just blurs the whole photo. That's not what I want, and I don't get why it's doing that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was good, now broken. Spot brightness suddenly brightens entire image when tapping the check mark"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless Keeps turning pictures 😡 yet not taken that way Frustrating!!!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this app has helped me edit photos for lockscreens to edits of band members 😂😂 i love it so much"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to use app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ads when you select a photo. Doesn't even wait for you to set effects or when processing. Then to disable ads takes a subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Suddenly only produces low res images. And i subscribed! If not fixed... Worse than useless to me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Not bad but I wish there was on option to go back and redo edits especially if you're happy with text positions and colors and such."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's a decent editing app, however, it will not save my pictures to my phone. It'll go through the process of saving, but I cannot find them anywhere in my gallery. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Decent but I noticed on adjusting the dimensions on collages, I don't see any way to change it from landscape to portrait i.e. being 16:9 to 9:16. So to do portrait, it's just a guess on the dimensions."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I hate this aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Just Perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The application is very good for creating collage. It is better if there has simple layout for 5 images. Now the layouts for 5 images are in complicated structure."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Manzar Samejo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I would have rated with 5 stars if you haven't added the ""Pay to Use Offline"" thing."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very little"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Unable to do much editing anymore like darken or lighten, etc. Even the templates are now limited. What happened?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is a decent app. I suggest ""Polish"" instead, but this is still good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"In app purchases are not initially informed before downloading."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app to edit color my drawings, and it is the best I ever used. The adds don't get in the way often. It has a verity of cool selections to make pictures and photos stand out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super cool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like this app and I've been using it for years to edit photos or ads. I really hope you add these features?... 1. Calligraphy fonts and some options where we can add stroke or shadows. 2. Add Layers - so we can just delete one incase we want to edit, instead of undo-ing everything. 3. Resize to a bigger image. Thank you so much for making this app. It sure helped a lot of people around the world. :) My reply: Oh yeah why didn't I check if you have a website! Thanks for telling me~~~"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love your app. Been using it for decades but now your app sucks really bad! Everytime i edit any pictures, after i save, it doesnt turn out in my gallery. Whats the problem? Very disappointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Overall good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It had once been a good app to edit photos for years, but no update will stop it from crashing. The numerous loud and irritating ads- durr, I know, you gotta make money, blah blah blah- they aren't worth dealing with since all it can do is CRASH and lose my progress, making me start over. I wouldn't pay to remove the ads, because it would still crash crash crash, and it wouldn't be worth the money either. But I'll keep fighting with it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice 😎easy 😁I love it you can make lot's of stuff here it's really fun easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are blocking the ""DONE"" button so I can't finish anything to save it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is good but no perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I searched for a free editor. This is not free. AND they expect you to kizz their azz in their agreement terms. They started with a LIE by their use of ""free."" This means they just cost me time, and I am not cheap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Balra"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am really used to this app because of the simple layout and editing experience. More great features~"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"In Retro , some fonts are missing for last few days, some normal fonts appeared suddenly. I reinstalled the app but still old fonts are missing. Especially a font it was like cursive writting a slanting , running font."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"زیاد جالب نیست"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"SAIF"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Usefull, Thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"what exactly can you do with it. its not an editor but a way to add affects which is not what i wanted or what its name implies. Get something different if you actually want to do something more than add words or hues"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nothing wrong with the app. Just didn't have the features I was looking for ( HDR stacking & panorama stitching )"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nope. I am usually quite tolerant of ads; however, I am furious that this stupid app tried to automatically download another app, not Play protected. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pictures don't save!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sobrang ganda! Kasi di sya katulad sa ibang app na halos lahat ng tools for editing may bayad.. andaming mga frames Meron pang stickers nakaka enjoy talaga"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't add photos on a photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"5 star reviews for YEARS but Pixlr is getting greedy and is making it impossible to use the app without an overpriced subscription. Now they've added a new feature where they won't let you use it offline unless you buy the subscription but it backfired and won't let me use it ON INTERNET-says I need to enable WIFI but I AM ON WIFI! Have to uninstall and use my other apps instead. Luckily there are better alternatives on the market now as Pixlr is so very determined to sabotage its company. RIP!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Delete"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Can you add a patch update? In some font groups, there's just the default font about four times in a row, I can't access the one I usually use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Aung"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can make tumbnail from this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Why it compresses images so much, I have no clue. App should just be a link to the phone browser version, Pixlr M"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The fade option is missing and due to it I missed a deadline and lost a client 😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good😍 Maganda🥰"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Only pic editer I use it's the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My favourite font from the text retro option has disappeared suddenly... There's some glitch.. can it be rectified ?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Any software license means you will f with my data. Pass."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really good App, six year experience of use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app. I've used it for a few years and love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After all editing is done & when I click on save option, photo is not appearing in my mobile.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used this app for years as my go to editing app. Absolutely perfect. Criticisms: Font selection while there are plenty to choose from, are pretty meh and there could be more. Especially better handwriting ones. There's no way to freehand crop things and save it that way, it's all rectangles. It'd be really helpful to add this in your photo editing app. For the Collage options, every single one crops the photos you add and you can only zoom out so far, which still leaves them cut off weird."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It works well enough. Stickers, filters, text, effects-- all very nice. But you have to pay for the best ones. There's also ads when saving every photo. It's still okay for what it is."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The best photo editor!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is trash one I can't use two photos one over laying the other one 2 the features are so Limited also the settings doesn't have a back button I'm on a motorola e really aynoying to restart just get out of settings and they have the nerve to say follow our Instagram you don't really have enough features don't install this app I'm putting 5 stars so people will see this!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a great user friendly app and would be even better if more stickers are added to it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad aap please guys don't install this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"To hard to know what all the icons are about"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great features! It WAS my go-to editor. But glitches make my work fail to save now and they want to charge me a monthly fee. Not good for hobbyists and pros have much better options."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest update has a lot of issue. It messes up the dimensions of the photos after making a collage and the ads are also annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Best photo edit app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A wonderful software. Hope liquify, thinify n breast features will b provided soon. My edited and saved pics are not visible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It works fine, but i wish it save more resolution from the raw image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling... downloaded the app in order to edit raw images and convert to jpg, but it totally doesn't work without showing any error or explanation. I select the raw image from the library, the icon is displayed in the library. But after clicking on the image nothing happens. Probably the file is too big or not supported, but you should tell it!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"clear data the i can found where have to save more 😁👍🏼"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"නියමයි"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Features are limeted so nit for professionals"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Use it all the time! Love the color match option in doodle."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Old version like 2015 was way you better...Anyway...Does what it says. I currently use another designer and uninstalled it. Might use again if needed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect for making quick image edits, my only wish is an option to export saved images as .png to keep transparent backgrounds."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Some features would be nice to have, like a way to change colors like in GIMP or paint."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's nice apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very poor for android"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Has been a great program until recently, but now after you have spent time with you edits you try to save your work & it crashes. I would have in years past given it a 5 star rating, but now until this issue gets resolved I give a one star. Guys I hope you get this resolved soon, or I will have to drop my premium user & find another photo editor that saves my work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's working good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"जब"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app. Almost perfect. Please add an option which allows to choose where to save every edited picture. Sometimes it is needed to change fast the original pic inside existing folder, sometimes I need to choose a specific destination. It is annoying when after every save it is needed to go to the default save folder and move it where wanted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years and I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am giving 5 to this app because it is hielpful for me to make pvc i am using it for many years love it. But it is a small cunfusion that we cant save the contens that we edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love you a lot of money but I love it I know you can't."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Deleted. Subscription B/S?! Bye bye pixlr!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I did love this app, but the most common feature I use is the lighten or draken to edit specific areas of a photo. Now, when you try to use this, it just lightens the whole pic once you click done, so it's useless as a tool. Currently looking around for an alternative editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Anywhere I can get a previous version usability for me went way down on current version"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice ads, dillrods."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great free editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My primary photo editing app.... Probably the only one that you will need..... Would be good if they could add a photo stitch function.....BTW happy to be your beta tester... I also used your Web version previously."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled, did not like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not sure what went wrong... All the sudden it can't open my all pictures... Not sure if it's the apps fault or Androids fault... Recent update seems a little buggy!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Disappoing worst app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not a single new feature added in this application since years !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No stamp tool. Cannot select area copy and paste. Useless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I want to rate a 5 because I love this app for years. However recently none of the frames or stickers will open. Some other things don't open also. I Uninstaller and reinstalled the app but it didn't help. I PAID for all the stickers and frames etc. I have slso just sent an email to address this problem. How do I get it fixed? I am a loyal customer and nothing is working!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good Editor 👍🥰"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Just a great simple to use photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A good help... Exactly what I needed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not even a photo editor you can just add effects so instead use your phones default editor 0/10"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"When adding text, there is no auto alignment (dynamic alignment). We cannot add outer frame/border. Needs improvement in frames and collage. The best and clean UI photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice app with good features, I highly recommend this app to any one looking for a good photo editing app...!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to use. Paid for it. Pixlr was sold to a new company who didn't honor the original deal. Fair enough. But so is my score since I lost functionality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The best photo editor app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's been a great app for years but I notice now - it warps some pics while saving, and has been saving blurry on every pic. The quality of the picture is worse than before using Pixlr. Hopefully it's fixed soon."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened here? This used to be my favorite app now nothing works on it! 😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So many extra features very fun!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"DJ pegu"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Who doent need this puppy for so many pieces of ya puzzling"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I recall purchasing this for a one time fee a few years ago, had soooo many options. But now there's a monthly fee, and not nearly as many options."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Color picker not working properly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Would be great but cropping a photo most of the times makes it extremely blurry and pixelated. Borderline useless for most things because of it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not download handwritten. Error storage and network connection. But my storage free 15 GB . and my net speed 30 mb per second. Please clear this problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app really lets you think you get a free trial and then tries to charge you for a year??? With no option to decline this app is a scam don't sign up!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute rubbish. Doesn't save pics.. What's the point."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best app ever for editing my pictures. I use it in years and reach it easily on my device when needed and edit some specific details from the app to make my favorite pictures. Thanks for the smart app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super 👌 experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super cam"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good and usefull app , sometime saving image shows problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Had to Google changing stupid text size on Android and still didn't find the answer. Really you couldn't make it plain and simple something as basic as changing text size on Android app?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is fine but, attempting to save an image causes unmuted audio ads to play. Very intrusive. Hard pass."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have used pixlr since 2015 & it's been a solid photo editor. I had originally purchased the ad removal license with the expectation that I would no longer have to view ads in the app. Unfortunately over the years they started to add and remove various features on a whim (annoying but ok), but they have recently decided to make the ad-free option subscription based, so now I'm being pestered with ads. Not paying a monthly fee and not interested in ads. Will need to find something else I guess."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's five star but I'm give one star just for the app I'm having issues with handwriting on my phone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Work on Image Saving. There is an Issue going on in the application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow this pixlr app is so amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very good program. I will never pay a monthly fee for an android app."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am a paying customer of Pixlr on web and it's great software to work with.But I was surprised to see that there is no option to login using my credentials on the Pixlr app.Very disappointed to see that, despite being paying customer. Please add the option to login and use the features. Hope to see this change made ASAP. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I signed up yesterday for a three day trial and it doesn't let me use nothing. I am not happy at all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doodle doesn't do anything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What the heck? This isn't free this is freemium ware. Didn't use to be. Now you have to pay to save your own pics. Thanks but um no. Uninstalling what has become a money grab mess."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Don't use it, very worst app. It doesn't detect pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wasted my data"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keep getting error while downloading packs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to download font packs. Was fine so far."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr has been my go-to app for years. Simplicity, power, and ease of use have kept this work course on top of the list. When things go wrong, their customer service is on it. Kudos, and thank you very, very much!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Edit: it works now, BUT the quality of saved images is horrible! (and yes i did select max quality)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trying to use the smooth function, it's not working/not doing anything🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be good. Suddenly dont know what has happened"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my fav editing app as it was so quick and easy. Then they got greedy. You have to pay for a lot of things now and there's too many ads. Final straw was when one started blaring out music - absolutely not, thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It may well be ""free"" for the basic usage of this app, but, quite honestly, it's still one of the most boring apps I've used...most of the so-called ""effects"" are just mundane filters, and any adjustment tools are just very average, ""run-of-the-mill"" types, too. This app leaves a lot to be desired, and is so totally uninspiring to even be worth downloading! Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gotta be one of my fav apps because i mostly use editor apps to make simple collages & watermarks and this is the perfect one! There's no annoying ads & the app is aesthetic too! Oh well there's no in add purchase!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is hard to use i am trying to edit but idk how to edit with this app i am sorry but i have to give it a one star"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"♡♡♡♡♡♡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have Been Using This App Since 2017 It Was Nice Till Now But Suddenly I Got An Issue On Saving The Photos.Pixlr Is Showing Me A Pop-up With ' Choose A Folder To Save Your Photos' Giving Options Of Yes Or No.So Obviously I Clicked 'Yes',There Is No Folders To Choose,The Storage Shows Empty. App Is Unable To Read My Internal Storage.My All Apps Are Working And They Are Not Facing Any Kind Of Problems Related To Storage. I'd Tried Reinstall Process Also,But Still Getting The Same Result."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worked great for a while, then I could no longer save pictures- they went into limbo! I tried every developer solution as well as user work-arounds (looking in file folders, resetting defaults, etc.), but nothing worked."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Well I paid for ad removal and now I have ads once again... I contacted support and they keep telling me to Uninstall it and reinstall it.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless. I can't even find the pics that I saved to my phone, what's the point in putting in the time to use this if I can't even get the pic when I'm done."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for a really long time and suddenly with the last update i can't find the saved photos on my phone!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"App crashing on middle times."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years. Recently it started deleting my pictures off my phone without notice. All of my pictures from this past month are gone. Not even in my trash folder. I'll update my review if the issue is resolved, but I am livid."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. Lots of fun stickers & boarders. The default save location is inside the app folder itself. To change, go to settings, default save location. In the upper right, click the drop-down, then choose, See internal memory. Now you can navigate to another location, like DCIM."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for awhile now.....just recently some of the features have disappeared. I have cleared the app but it hasn't made a difference. Re: fix. I have removed and reinstalled the app. The missing overlays and frames still have not returned."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tools are horrible"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editing app of all time and have been using it for a couple years. Easy to use and lots of tools!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Got this app as reviews had said it could work in layers as well as provide some more advanced photo editing functions. After having tried to use it by itself and the completely unhelpful company blog I'm removing it for being another selfie editor program."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Has no options"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gooda"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since 2015. This is by far the most user-friendly app I've come across."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Generally it's great apk. It saves pictures into default folder as which format selected and at the sametime, it makes a copy into root directory. Two file are asame. I hope you will review this issue. Best regards"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"worst experience....couldn't edit photo without online by this app. I don't understand that why people rated it five star? it's a shity apps 😑😑"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Today (Sep 24, 2021) after touch save image, the files doesn't saved to my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice application best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Aw man, apps that are good overall but have one area that totally suck brings the stars down. Text.. if you type anything, it is received as one long train of words and you have to manually return text so you can get it onto a new line. This does not work if your text input has met the limited amount of characters which is rubbish. This app needs to sort the text input pronto. Now things aren't saving to a gallery album. Saving the pics makes them disappear. No update can sort this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unusable due to loud and frequent ads"

Then I try to clear the data, suddenly all the 'downloaded' features are gone literally like, it's not there, it's blank where I can't even re-download it. I try to re-install, and it was just the same. Please helppp. Need to download my font."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to hv this this app but when i install it now its sheet its has changed so badly..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I had this app for years and they got rid of the feature for free text with a wide variety of fonts. Came back to use it for my club. Very dissapointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Missing Effect and overlay menus on Android 11 tablet...only shows default option for both so very limited compared to app on phone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Waste!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Rakibulsk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'am sorry but image editor without image resizing, and not cropping, it may as well be called image enhancement app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍It's quite a good app. And it's pretty easy to use but I like snapseed more cuz it can do more things but this is also very good. It can do some of the things snapseed cant do"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is so very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good. Works excellent &quick"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I was hoping to cut from one image and paste it to another"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's a real good editor. Still my go to app for quick editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"গুড"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ver Gooooooooooddddddddd"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So stupid! Try to type on the field digits in small size. You need a microscope to see what you typing. Man.... what is happing with the world. Every one is soooo stupid these days."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"How Save my Picture ????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best apps that I had been using for past 4 years but now a strange problem developed. Whenever I save any picture, they neither show in folder nor does it load. I wish the problem is fixed soon or else most unwillingly I will be forced to uninstall it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's very beautiful app I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Honestly disappointing, I've been using Pixlr/e for a long time now, and this comes nowhere close to that, the only thing that this app should have, to make worth installing over the hundreds of identical image editors for Android is the selection tool. Why none of the apps have it? Seriously, very disappointing. To whoever read this, please add a selection tool similar to Pixlr/e."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Been using pixlr for over 6 years, I've learned to edit really good photos with it almost like as if I was using photoshop. I know there's apps that basically do it for you, but I enjoy being able to have my dog fight godzilla"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Updated today. And just today it has deleted 3 edited photos. I'll be finishing up and it suddenly kicks me out and takes away EVERYTHING I just did. I want my editing app back what is this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its actually really good for minor editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its an amazing app for editing pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i love this app i always have it on my first page. its really simple and easy to use to make quick memes"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saved pictures are missing always. Useless. It says its saved but doesnt appear anywhere even at any file manager."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After using this app my email was found on the dark Web. Not exactly trustworthy with my information."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great UX"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This is just Pixlr-O-Matic with a pricetag, and the original app disabled. I get that you need to make money, but c'mon now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Initial impressions are very favorable. This app shows the promise of being a very good tool for my image editing. One of the reasons for the 5 star review is because I had problems at first, most likely my own errors, and I left a 1 star review saying Pixlr won't work on my tablet. Pixlr support responded very quickly asking how they could help."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Irritating just long 30 sec video ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best picture editor out there. Simple yet everything you need for BASIC photo editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I was looking for an app that would work towards enhancing the image and help clean up the blurry issues. Preferably like google photos edit does but only better. This app does pretty much like every other app on here. Except the enhancing part."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"By far the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Kamal ha"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for many years and all I can I say is that it is a Great app. 🥰🥰🥰"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I can no longer change the font color - used to be able to... somewhat of an irritation.. looking for another app..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I am someone who have been using Pixlr E and X for months, almost a year. Now that I am using phone lore than my pc, I was looking forward to using this app. I was disappointed because I saw a few features missing. The features that made me use Pixlr in first place. First thing is layers. I understand that you can't make money by adding layers but you can limit the number! Make like 3 layers are for free and for more buy premium. Second feature was colour swap. I wish the app was more like site."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a long time. Now all of a sudden having non saving issues. Ive loved it. Great for business. Gonna Uninstall and try reinstalling it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps stopping"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nonintuitive menus made a simple cropping operation a long waste of time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like this app😃"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"👎👎👎👎 now app requires directory access, telephone access?? thank you for your earlier editing services that were awesome. uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My personal information was breached through this app years ago before I found out, otherwise I always loved the app. Just an FYI to everyone, keep up to date on your credit reports for updates about your personal information that's out there!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app using sinse 2015"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super cool app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Purchase account online via browser, I thought it will be restore here in my phone. But not. Does the purchased online and here is different?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Whatever you did in last update, it screwed up the app. Did you try to insert ad feature? It now crashes everytime i load a picture in it and try to render it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One star for the sarcastic response to my first 1 star review that for some reason isn't up anymore. Unprofessional."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"After last update it cant even save on its own file need to create new one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads, ads ,ads, ads, ads!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I tried editing a photo... That seemed to work. Then I tried to save. It wanted to save in some file that apparently does not exist in my phone. I gave the app permission to access my gallery. It accessed a photo from my gallery to edit. Then it couldn't find somewhere to save???? How about my gallery?????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"sinple & the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads while editing are torture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really great & fantastic editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"no expirence"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It was working fine before. Now edited images are NOT being saved on Pixlr album like app says, they are not being saved anywhere. Yes, I have tried uninstalling the app, clearing cache/data, restarting/rebooting and all of that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I DON'T LIKE THE NEW UPDATE WHENEVER I TRIED TO USE THE ""HEAL"" EFFECT THERE'S A GREEN SPOT ON THE AREA THAT I USED IT WITH. WHAT HAPPENED????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been use this app for a very long time. I don't know what happened so I can't find my saved pictures anymore in my gallery. I've tried to find them from file manager but it's has the same result."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Looks like a well put together app. My specific need is for a flip or mirror tool. I can not find one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for over two years and only recently got the premium feature. Its so much fun to use and my friends get a kick out of the photo manipulations I do with it. That is mainly what I use it for. There are so many filters and sliders that I can even match skintones for manipulations pretty well too! My only criticism for this is that during editing when u can paint/erase, there should also be an undo button there too. If you had that this app would be PERFECT. I still ❤ it!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the pest ever photo editor i have ever used. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"saves as jpg with no option to change"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for years with no problems. Recently, though, it stops saving images entirely and I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The application is unstable. performance is getting worse"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"always liked but now app isn't connecting to internet leaving some features unavailable."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"God job"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Double exposure performance very worst.... I can't see clear image... please fix this.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really good app, actually it's the best photo editing app out there for mobiles Using it for good 2 years now Highly recommended!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"After a reply from the devs it would appear that saving is restricted by latest android os. So let you off."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I only have 1 negative and that' I wish you didn't charge for some of the extra like stickers and such I remember when you didn't and I love everything u have on this app so I wish I could use those as well.. I ve used this app for years now I use it pretty much daily it's easy to use and makes pics awesome. Ty"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever never play it I cant put 0 stars if i could i would"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Says free right in the title but all of a sudden when I try to do something in the app it wants me to pay... NOT FREE and misleading. False advertisement. 0 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"MY FAVORITE TO EDIT PICS ON!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Rate your experience for ads shown inside the app for how easy to use the app is..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to usr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sabotage. They made their app unusable unless you buy it again, even if you've already paid for it. Dishonest editor, deceitful app. Good news: Snapseed is far superior and free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"2/5 overall 1/5 on tools to use 2/5 on ease of use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great app but a lot of bugs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now it's just subscription trash."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I don't usually mind ads that come with so-called ""free"" apps but having pop-up ads while I'm editing my photos, are ridiculous and a deal breaker for me. Promptly uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Awesome tool for pic editing purpose"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Esaly used app... Cooll mind.. & Better performance...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Easy and has it all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I really like this app and use it a lot! The only thing is that I wish you could add multiple pictures to one project and edit the layers like in the PC browser version. I also wish that you could use the cutout option also in the PC browser version. But other than that, I love this app! I highly recommend it to everyone!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is really the best. This app helps a lot to be the best for my edits. Thank you and I would recommend using this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best editing app that i used, The other app don't have quality as good as this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not what it used to be."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have to pay. Not a free app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't even save my photos anymore, though it says it's been saved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It doesn't save the pictures!!! I use this app almost a year now and for some reason it has stopped saving the pictures after editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Raw Images Editing is Available?? Jpeg or jpg formats images reduced its quality by every edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"the app is great i would recommend i personally use it a lot to make memes i have noticed that the color black doesnt work maybe its a bug or just may phone not liking the app :/ it was just my phone the app works fine"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It won't let me access to the photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"image is not saving into gallery"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Missing some of the most important features for a photo editor: select, wand, and lasso tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Qwetuop"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"MY QUESTION IS ABOUT PHOTOS SAVED FOLDER PROBLEM. WHY CREATING FOLDERS EVERY TIME WITH NEW NAME CHANGED? LIKE PIXLR_52/PIXLR_68 THIS FUNCTION IS VERY BAD HOW MANY FOLDERS SEARCH ON MY PHONE FOR ACCESS MY PHOTOS?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"𝙼𝚘𝚔𝚜𝚞𝚍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be the BEST app! Now, it has deleted the pics I edited and can't get back! Seriously, ridiculous!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cropped saves turn out blurry. Was fine a few weeks ago."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Always enjoyed it untill Recently i started experiencing a problem where the screen get struck while editing/adding text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app doesnt even know how to save FIX THIS !!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"After comparing Pixlr with Snapseed and Polish, I see that Snapseed easily triumphs over all except Photoshop from Adobe. Adobe aside, Snapseed offers all professional functions in an easy way without ads... Polish again wins over Pixlr by having Remove tool. Pixlr Heal tool is horrendous, especially in complex spots... While Pixlr is good at desktop, then it fails against, say, GIMP.... I don't know what to say but for the fine tuning of photos Pixlr is not up to the task."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I LOOOVVVE IT."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I usually love this app, but I have to change my rating. I've grown to like it a lot, however, my vision is very bad and makes it hard to use this app on my phone. I went to download it on my tablet and saw that its not available in my tablets Google play store. is there any way to get it for a tablet? I don't have a laptop I can use and would love to continue using the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your pointless and forced ads are preventing your app from working, so why would anyone buy it? I'll just switch to another free one that's how apps work... you know?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"not worked in oppo Reno 5 pro android version 11"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Changing my review... They fixed the problem with saving photos and is back to awesome!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"App is decent but would be useful with a magic wand tool to remove background"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Large loss of quality when trying to edit images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very fantastic app I never seen like this but some future must be change otherwise it is very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"would be nice if it had actually useful features ngl"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to be my go-to editor.. sigh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I just for the yearly subscription and I can only use it when I delete the app and the re download and restore purchase. Then it works. But the next time I go to use it it says I need to buy it again until I start the process over with deleting it -.- I use it alot so I hope you can resolve this issue for me would be a 5 star if it was for that"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save the images"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't remove background"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"been my go-to since grade 7 (so for the last 8 years) and it's no turned glitchy, won't load your photos, is incredibly slow and bogged down with it's ad feature any time you save the finished image. unfortunately uninstalling after all these years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Total Wastage App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've used this app for over a year. It's handy to do some quick editing on your phone. It has some bugs that cause it to crash if your phone isn't the best. Use this app on a next gen device or tablet for best result. I'm having an issue where it is not allowing me to save my work any more. I get an error message claiming there isn't enough storage space, which isn't true. This just started happening a few weeks ago. Is this another bug?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, but for months now it hasn't been able to save picture collages. It asks for the folder to save it in, when I confirm it acts as if it had saved the item but it never shows up in the folder or anywhere else. It also stops music apps while ""saving"" even if there is no ad playing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Leaving this review to point out that the blur tool is currently bugged and needs to be worked on. Other than that, One of the best photo editing apps out there."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"U guys made it so bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm not a pro user of this kind of app, so I can't fault it. Especially since it did exactly what I needed. Within seconds I was able to figure out how to superimpose a photo or double negative... It is a fairly clean app. The ads weren't too terribly long. I didn't easily save the photo at first, but the share feature worked on the first try. This will be fun to play with more."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app bhai"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Unsure how to successfully subscribe for the full version at the promotional discounted rate. 1st sub- noted mistake, canceled in 1hr. 2nd sub- gave up, paid full price. 3rd sub- looking elsewhere :\ Unable to find paid version in Play Store. In-app purchase shows full price at checkout, not the promo annual rate advertised. Not sure if I'm missing something less intuitive or maybe I'm just dumb; both have potential! haha"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Excellent App."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Honestly I love this app I've used it for over a year and, yes it is lacking someplaces, it's got pretty much everything you need from color variation to, well, everything almost great app 10/10 would recommend"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why is it trash after update!! Pictures are saved very blurry. And it couldn't keep up the ratios. Trust been it's the best app I have used before and it is so bad now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Veey nicee app nd editing app.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It has everything I need"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"THE IMAGE QUALITY IS VERY BAD! PLEASE FIX IT!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The new version is really bad and I experienced so many problems.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for almost two years now.. but after the last update the text keyboard feature has got some problem. as soon as you try to write something the app starts glitching all over which is really frustrating. so two stars for now..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I use to love editing my photos with this but now you can't do much like overlays or anything without having to pay."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I give it 4 star bcz it really gud I really amired it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very very nice app Il love it I am 11 years old I love editing my family and my photos Please install fast"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Khup chhan. Easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Why is there no timer, how on earth are we supposed to take pics from afar, with telepathy?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can not use the eraser tool to erase out effects from certain parts of the picture. I tried to reinstall it, even cleared the cache. Still no luck!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, must download"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"easy to use, great effects. been using since 2014. Still the best app ever. 8/4/21 App says pic is saved into my Pixlr folder in my gallery, but it isn't saving the pictures.2/4/19 Keeps crashing in the middle of editing without saving first.UGHHHHH uninstalled and reinstalling to see if that fixes it. PLS fix it!! Red eye tool doesn't work either.2/20/19"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fine app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app really helps with a lot of things, but there is one issue which is rlly important, hence the 3 stars. Whenever I edit a picture, the quality of the finished picture is always bad, and even worse when I actually save it. Hopefully this can be fixed because apart from this issue, it really helps with a lot of things."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I want to preface this by saying that I have used this app for over a year now, and plan to continue doing so. I recommend anyone looking for a free image editing software to try this one. This comes with an important caveat however- this app will randomly send you back to the homescreen or crash at very inopportune times, so I recommend saving multiple times if your work and time are valuable to you. It is amazingly frustrating and disappointing when this happens, and it happens pretty often."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ultimate working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Please this application has bugs, not downloading any post !!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great price for FULL YEAR."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like how organized things are when editing photos unlike other apps which lacks organization of editing features. Other than that, this app is very easy to use and most of the functions are direct to the point. I hope they develop the function to adjust face shape and size and even adjust eye levels."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I give it 2 stars cause this app used to be really fun and useful. I've had this app for a long time now and have seen many changes. There were so many options to make a really cool edit. Not so much anymore. Let's just say I'm glad I'm not paying for it cause it's not even worth it's price tag anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Update: The ads on this app have become so intrusive I don't even care to use it any longer. That's sad because it's a great app. This app has it all. I have no complaints. Well done!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I cant save pictures anymore and i cant even share them !!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love sexy my pictures!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fun for editing pictures. Great tool for color splash!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Still missing key functionality for a picture editing app (resize canvas etc) Will probably never be addressed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr has great tools that are simple to utilize and used to be able to save images to my phone. The app no longer saves images that I save and I search for them and they aren't anywhere to be found. I see other users are having the same issue. There is no folder created for the saved images like you would expect. I only have the photo I originally took, but no as edited image is even saved. Had to uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"A simple tool with more needed features. Please add live size showing feature while saving photo. Then I would give it 5 star. Although it's a good app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Is there any chance the app features batch ai enhancer? I have 7710 images (not more than 1mb of size each) to enhance. That would be a useful feature for us, since all this images only requires to enhance a certain similar aspect for all of them and it is a burden to edit it 1 by 1. I hope you will have such feature in the future. The app is awesome by the way, legitimately enhancing the image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😭👅👅😒😏😏😏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It was really great, but recently it's been really buggy. Whenever I take a photo with the app, it'd freeze and then won't save. Whenever I grab a photo to edit, it works fine. BUT... when I go to save the photo, it won't save properly. Again, really great app, but just... very buggy recently."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thanks so much for a great photo editor!! No matter which I've tried none gives control, options & outcome better than Pixlr. :) After advised to update, app hasn't kicked me out mid edit since! Once again my fave!! ;)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazing app I'm using this from 2016 features r awesome including fronts"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good for photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use it for everything I love it!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I can't save pics in png. format anymore. Why? This used to be a really useful feature for transparent backgrounds."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app and Pixlr app is amazing for youtube thumbnail"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great little app! Seriously. Customer service was quick to help with a bug, too. I'd love to give them some money to get rid of the ads, but I'm not signing up for a subscription. If you're reading this, maybe you will use it enough to justify subscribing. Personally, I think it's scummy (thus a lower rating), but to each their own."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm using this from last 10-11 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Where is some effects in new verision?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love Pixlr and have used it for years. However, recently none of my pictures will actually save!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👌👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Free, user-friendly, limited features can sometimes be a pain. Would love more options with layering options, blurring specific places, and copying texture to paste elsewhere (clone stamp)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love remaking my photos"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Going the wrong direction! I have enjoyed it for some time. Like others the save and hunt for my pictures is old and I am done. I wish my default location would be my SD card and not the phone. I have the SD card for that reason. I will uninstall and look for other options. I may try this again, after the next few updates."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good for photo editing. Worked great once for double exposure feature but it's gone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good work. Very Nice aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I make the most beautiful art"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr app does not save to Pixlr folder"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wth is wrong with this App? I can't find any photos on my Gallery or Photos!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's just amazing app , we can do so much with this , you all should also try the app if you want some editings in yours photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update is terrible. Now I have to go hunting on my phone to load and save pictures. Great app but is getting worse and worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Font colour are not changeable only black and white are in option now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Don't save to my gallery anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am using this app since 2011. And it always performed too great. But now in era of status. It should come up with music additions option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Proper not working reasor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Proper not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Use to be my go-to photo tweak app, but just encountered video ads -- WITH SOUND -- while trying to save a file tonight... and they're hidden under the save dialog so you can't shut them up without finishing or canceling 🤮"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years. Love it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy Cool App 👻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Everything is good otherthan blur options please include types of blur like motion blur ,smart blur option"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app from the good old days of pixlr o matic haha what a time it was to discover such a unique app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app took me forever to figure out. When I finally did the app was all together a diasapointment (I don't know if it was just for me because im on a laptop). I realy was expecting more from the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This has been a super useful app until fairly recently. It's still great for resizing images or fixing color /contrast or adding some spice to an image. However, it started saving images in a different folder with no input from myself which was annoying. While I've hit default it continued to do so. Moved the other ones to the new one but now when I click to choose a photo it always starts in the pixlr folder rather than the camera one as it used to, so a quick touch up is a lengthier process."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hello Pixlr developing team... atleast add background removing option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have downloaded this app with each device upgrade. Awesome app thx guys Update Since I purchased the app my finished projects will not save to my device please advise!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app, very easy to use. Especially liked the filters..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saved images not showing in folders. Wondering where they go"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"can't delete images made using this app on my chromebook. Edit: I've checked every single file and can't find my images."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nicce"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: For anyone not able to find their photos in the gallery! I can confirm that in Settings (tap the home screen icon in the top left corner), if you choose a folder that is accessed by your gallery, your photos will be there..I repeat, your photos will easily be accessed through your gallery. Also, I paid for the version with no ads and I'm back to loving the app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I'm disappointed now. Won't save the photos to my phone."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice one.. One of my favorite in my photo editor app list.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"pitcher don't saves to my gallery"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Can't save photos to gallery anymore! Please sort this out!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Save the pics, damnit. Edit: Thank you for replying. Reinstalled and its working fine now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now none of the pictures I edit or collages I make get saved no matter how many times I go back through and press the save to device button."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"wont save my photo when finished. Now it won't let me change the color of things i type when making a flyer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pure rubbish...no font size editing or anything..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be one of my favorite apps, until it stopped saving the finished edits and they are not where the developer keeps saying they are."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've had this app for over ten years, and it's decent. It is pretty basic. It gets the job done. But one of the most annoying things ever is, right in the middle of a ""project"", and ad will play that's 20-30 seconds long and un-skippable. The dev team needs to have a chat with their advertisers. Android version REV1.0; Samsung S20 Ultra 5G with latest version of app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I reinstall it... it can save now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for YEARS but the last few months it crashes while I try to save and I lose a lot of work. And today after over an hour of work it went back to the main menu randomly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It no longer saves photos to my phone. Whats the point of editing photos you can't keep?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😍😍😍😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good useful tool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I so love this app it's my fav it's easy to use and Its awesome used for about 5 or 6 yrs now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"STILL doesn't allow you to save edited photos at original resolutions! 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Nice App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"EDIT: The bug as been fixed. The app is back to downloading images. Thanks, guys! ❤️ This app stopped downloading saved images to my phone months ago. I've reinstalled several times. The only reason I keep it around is that the screen grabs of the finished work are still usable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great when it works, I use it for all my edits that don't require a lot of more in-depth adjustments... But recently it's started only letting me edit one photo before bugging out and not letting me edit another photo... Which is a HUGE problem for me, as I regularly edit a set of photos to have the same adjustments/filters/etc. to match each other. PLEASE update soon!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Simply superb."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the best of them all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not free anymore. They charge you money for using stickers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When i collage the photo in the app, there is nothing wrong, but after is saved the collaged photo, the picture was streched to the side (makes the pict look wider). Tried to save with all the resolution option, the result are the same."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr hsi A good apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Won't save to my album anymore.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Like everyone else, I loved using this app until it stopped saving files properly. They're not in my gallery and they're not in my Pixlr photo album, as they say they should be. I changed my settings to change the location my files are saved... They're still not there. No point in keeping the app, it's useless to me now. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened. Out of nowhere, this app's ads started interfering with using it. Trying to save an image took three attempts because clicking done just opened a video ad which prevented saving. And, when I went to pay for it, because I've used it for quite awhile, I discover you can't purchase it anymore. It's only a subscription. Not happening, guys. You've ruined what was a great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Umm, can't draw shapes or straight lines"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My old andoed editer app only cell change not like this types of game add image on to oll frames edit pich luck best text best size od picher creating n cooll feachers of came taking image sorry for my speling mistake"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"like"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This has been my favorite editor for years and now it's buggy and loaded with so many ads it makes the app glitch out. It doesn't always save and now for some reason it doesn't save all of my edits and actually saves glitch images and half finished edits after spending an hour on them. This is trash and i will not be returning."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"FROM GOOD TO BAD, always stuck at loading when I want to save a picture."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"New update is unabling me to save the photo on my phone - what happened, I have plenty of space"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The devs say the images are now saved in the photo album, but this is just simply not true. If that were the case, I could go to my photo album and find the photos. Instead of having to search through my file system through an emulated folder to find these photos buried deep in my phone like a mystery. I dont know about you, but that is just simply not the photo album... Used to love this app. But the way photos are saved makes it really hard to access them and do anything at all with them..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice App. Been using for years already"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"As promised, happy to give this 5 stars now. App is saving to my gallery again, yay!! I've been using this app for years now. Easy to use & love it, thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best and most convenient photo editing app with many features👌📷"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless, as it does not save the photos. And no, it is not because Android has changed requirements. I have very well located the Pixlr album where, according to the app settings, the photos are saved, only to see the ones I had there months ago with no new files. There are many good photo editing apps, so it is best not to use this one at this point. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"You should keep the option of text size because its really important and you don't have that option. So bring the text size option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for so many years! I can't save photos anymore.😞 I hope this gets sorted ASAP 💚"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"That's good mata kaam"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a long, long time. But now when i use the ""heal"" function and save the edit i made the saved image shows a blueish mark where i made the edits. Why?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Payment options are limited. Please provide UPI and net banking (all banks) for a better experience."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Edited images won't save to phone so makes this app totally useless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Well I do like this app props where it's due BUT the ads have become beyond obnoxious and now the decision is uninstall or pay. The free version is not worth it. It's barely a free country anymore but until it isn't I don't need to sit through a 5-minute Facebook ad with sound ever again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using Pixlr for over 5 years now. It WAS great until they started saving the edited picture in Android:Data:com.pixlr folder which does not show up in Gallery anymore. Super annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for year on ios and android and... i have no idea what happened. I think the team just gave up and stopped solving bugs because at this point I can't even save the work I did. I used to use this for work, it's a shame. No other export option works either. It's time for me and thw app to break it off, sorry. It's honestly just not reliable at all."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It was crime for me to use this masterpiece without giving 5 stars ..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Possibly my most favorite mobile editing app,been using it for many years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite editing app but it has gone downhill. It rarely loads and edits/collages won't save to my phone anymore. There used to be fun things for holidays and they don't do it anymore. So disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Literally best app ever to exist"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer saves photos. Uninstalled & won't use again."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's quite good for editing! But.. I am still using picart..... so-"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Yeah I did what you said, It doesn't work! Reinstalled. Gave permissions. Checked again and again, still doesn't work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It used to be my favorite app these last few years, but I just downloaded another app really quick and found that to be significantly more intuitive in every capacity."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Solid editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"l'm just beginning."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Free and easy to use! So much better than other photo editing apps I have used"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saved file hide or missing in unknown folder.. before it's store in pixler folder...now edited file not showing in photo gallery..older version is much better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be outstanding. Now, it doesn't save pictures like it used to. Waste of time!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It stuck on 50% while saving the collage file... Otherwise it's good... But last update have some bug.... Like saving issue"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"No option to pay through UPI, Google Pay or Internet banking. Kindly make it available."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it. I can't though restoremy purchase in app.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's ok, it's definitely not Photoshop and isn't as good as it's desktop website equivalent, but it can create nice collages, sometimes. I use this in combination with other apps to get quick notes or ideas for my desktop later. Very nice how you don't need to be connected to the internet to use, like other annoying apps. But not quite up there; but awesome for being free! With some better features, I'd be willing to pay for it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There seems to be an issue with opening vertical pictures in Pixlr. They always open horizontally and then I have to rotate them. This is a new issue, it wasnt happening before. Sorry for the rating ,ilove your app and will give you 5 stars after you fix it...and what happened to "" ingrid?"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a couple of years and since the last update it has stopped working. It tells me that my images are saved to the Pixlr gallery but said gallery is inaccessible on my phone so it's taking up the storage space without any way to share it on say Facebook or even text. There just isn't an option to access the Pixlr gallery anymore, so I am sadly uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Yoo this app go hard"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Could you please make the modification of brightness level &.. easier and exactly like Snapseed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Issue with the app it doesn't save the edited pic in internal storage."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cannot save edited photos, trash app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I feel like this is one of the best out there I can see myself coming back here every time But it kinda ruins the quality of the image That's almost the only drawback Loving the App."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Always my go to app. Keeps closing . Can't use it. Please fix the problem Update This was the best but now it won't open. Or shuts down. No longer can use it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It was amazing for normal pictures edit but you should enable editing for videos too and since last update it is not saving files to folder they cant be saved I have to take screenshots"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I'm taking one star off due to lack of snapping to grid. When aligning text or images being able to snap to the middle would be helpful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Does it actually save your edit?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Easy to use. Adds arent in you're way. Spent hours on hours 😃 I use one other just to add photos on photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazing photo editing program! Easy to use, easy layout. Probably the best photo editing program there is for mobile! But there are a few problems with it. After the program processes the edits and saves the file, sometimes minor bugs appear visually. For example, some of my photos are split in half by a very thin line horizontally, or blocks of black appear on random spots. These bugs appear randomly, and sometimes you need to save the file multiple times for them to dissappear. Please fix <3"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Star 💯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years, finally paid for the premium features because I figured you've earned it by now. I did have a saving issue, but that seems to have been resolved since I've updated to the latest lineageOS. If I could request one feature, it would be the ability to add arrows or straight lines from point to point. It's difficult for me to draw a perfectly straight line that doesn't look shaky. Keep up the good work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Have no entree to purchase the account Ash on your ears"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Previously it was good,but now there are many errors in it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Quite easy to use. Highly recommend. Lots of various fonts and any color in the chromatic spectrum to create from."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"From the very beginning I was amazed !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my #1 go to photo editor app,, went into my photos to move photos to external drive only to find that the last months edits weren't saved about 50 photos,, so i tried a quick edit and save,, nope,, it's no longer saving my work !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Only saves to online or social media, will not save to local storage anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sorry, it was 5 stars but now I cannot find the pixlr folder ANYWHERE. I reinstaled the app and no results"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great application, for many years I used it, but the last version lost the images for example when you make a collage. I can configure the final path in settings, but the images never isn't there, only works with share button but with low resolution. It's sad because is a good application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Works good and is easy to use, but it's super annoying that the only way to get rid of the ads is to may a recurring fee. I'd love to pay for the app, but with a one-time purchase. Until that's an option, the developer sadly won't get any revenue from me and probably many others."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"One thing needs to update as early as possible is let all the texted sved at once. Now another type of text can't be written if first one is not saved. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and more number of text can be added but will save at once, this feature can make this app more worthful. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Hi ive been usimg pixlr since agaes and never been dissapointed . Its always fun using this editing app but dince few days im having teouble in saving my edited pictures to phone gallery. Kinfly help me out. Regards"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Very disappointed however to see saving as PNG is no longer working. Could have left less because of this but before this issue it was 5 star for me, still is to be fair. Hope it's fixed soon"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't tell you if it's good. Every time I open it I get raucous, loud ads. I can't even test it out! They desperately want you to buy it. Dumping it after a day. I want to replace Google Snapseed which is fantastic. But are they saving my photos and screenshots? Don't trust Sneaky Google."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good App."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👌👌👌👍👍👍👏👏👏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Going to uninstall and reinstall and see if it's fixed, but we shouldn't have to do this. If there is an error with other programs, then you as the developer need to figure out which one and find a way around it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was an awesome editor. It has so many wonderful effects and is so intuitive to use. I just spent20 minutes editing a picture to find out that when it says it saved, it really didn't. It really doesn't save anything now. 1 month later. It's still not fixed. I'll be looking for a new photo editor. And no, there is no special file folder. The images are nowhere on my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Some time not take"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Err when used tools type"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I cannot in good faith recommend this app anymore. The ads are intrusive, loud and pop up 90% of the time when trying to save an image. Very disruptive and annoying ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I like this app, except that I cant save photos. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it worked temporarily, but not anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"🤗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Usually a great app. For some reason now it will no longer save my images so it's a waste of time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Text added to the photo can't be re-sized."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Yeah my app just stopped working. It doesn't save pictures to my phone anymore, not even in its own alleged custom folder."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, impressive, and fun."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ive been using this for many years, but today has truly been sad. I was working on a project that ive been working on for ever, and it decided it didnt want to dave properly and shut down. Without saving it, or anything to bring it back. Its gone. Please fix this so no one has to go through this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Bhut tyt h ye app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"one of the best App for photo design i am using since seven year Love your team and best wishes for you ❤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"uninstalling..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love dizz app❤️❤️❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Have used this for years; but, it will not save photos anymore and it's a headache. The online version is wonderful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The pictures wont save after editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fixed and it was my bad))) But As Far As I'm Concerned This Is The Best Phone Photo editor App that I would reccomend anyone to use, and I've tried a lot of them.... This one by far is the best......."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't save pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not able to create a collage with 2 Photos. Its keeps on loading and loading. Even reinstalled the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cmon, its perfect! And you will give one star bcs they changed folder where your photos are? Are you that lazy? And they didnt do it. Its a 3rd party or a phone update. Not pixlr fault. Stay good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save pics"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save pictures after editing since update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exciting"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Hey, i have been using this for years but suddenly offlate pics are not getting saved. I have installed and uninstalled many times but i think something is wrong the pics are not getting saved anywhere. I looked and checked every possible settings in my phone. Please look into it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Like many others, I'm going to mention the fact that it no longer saves properly. I can't find the file it's saving to, if it actually is saving the files, as e developers claim. Fix this. Otherwise great app. Until the saving issue is fixed, I'm going to screenshot the images I work on after I'm done. It's a dumb extra step, but it works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Forced portrait mode, which doesn't really work for doodling. Has an ever-present ad bar that changes every five seconds."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"One of the best destructive photo editors for free. It's smooth, it makes sense to use, and the ability to stitch photos together as collages are great. What sucks is that you need an internet connection to run this app now. If you're okay with ads tracking you just to edit your pictures, this app is one of the best."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite app three years straight"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using Pixlr for years and I love it!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"no longer saving image"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Where's my image saved to?????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really great ❤👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"3 D"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hi there, thank you for replying to people who complained about the same thing I'd complain to, Pixlr no longer save pictures on the gallery. Such a shame Android has ruined everything. I didn't get your explanation about how to fix it so I'll send you an email. Thanks for making such a useful app, I really like it and hope there's a solution for this issue. And you, arrogant people, ask first what the problem is instead of being so rude because of trouble in an app you don't even pay for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Update: I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app and it was saving my photos again. But now here we are a few weeks later and it's not saving my photos anymore. I have paid version. Fix this Pixlr!!!! Can't save photos. The latest updates or something causes none of the photos to save. It says saved but nothing showed up anywhere in my phone. Not in file manager or also not in my photo gallery. It used to show in my photo gallery. If this is a glitch I hope it gets fixed very soon."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i've been using this app for years. every time i get a new device, this is one of the top apps i choose to download. i don't even pay for anything and there are still some really nice editing options. love it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What the heck? I've been using this app for years! Where is it sending my edited photos? I hate this so much! I hope it gets fixed but until then I'm on the hunt for another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Just like Joe says in his review....this was my go to app for all pictures.....now it saves the pics in a weird mysterious folder but i finally figured out how to change the location and now it's back to saving the picture the old way. Go back to you settings and then change the default folder back to the Pixlr but where all your other folders are. I did it, it worked! But please Pixlr, change it back for everyone I almost deleted this app I was getting so frustrated with not finding my pics!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am using this app from so many years ok, it was good edit app and art app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this feature packed app for some quick, creative backgrounds to use online. But I would LOVE if you could finally introduce borders and drop shadows for text. That's the one missing feature that keeps this from being perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be a great app for photo editing. Where did all of the filters go???? Example: the second set of image filters from the left ( the blurs, I used to call them ) used to be numerous and FANTASTIC to edit with. Now theres like 6 and its MEHHHH. What are you all doing over there? Why make something WORSE than before?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A photo editor that does not want permission to everything! Hey Pixlr I like your border idea. How about adding some colors besides Black and White. Just a suggestion."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It was great photoeditor ... But after update I can't find location of my picturs. 😥 Right now on my Lg V60 I can't put any words on the picture ""luging""... Need to restart everything and everything works fine but not mark words. It's was great app . But what is going on now I don't know. Uninstalled. So 😭 sad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lack of tools for android &iOS"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good lord! I managed to suss out over a month ago to uninstall and reinstall and that sorted out the saving issue, until this weekend when for no reason at all it defaulted back to not saving. You've had tons of time to adjust to Android OS's new requirements for saving. What you are saying about the new saves may make sense to you on paper but is simply not true to the experiences of longtime users (10 year 5 star Pixlr product user here!) across multiple phones and carriers. Time to move on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stick with version 3.2.8 and get the bonus font packs separately as that version doesn't access your info for ""reasons"". Or use Google Snapseed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good experiyans"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good worth"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It isn't working like it has for years. It's useless in the way it saves files now. :/"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great photo editing app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Keeps on closing again and again"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This has been my go to app for years but now when I save stuff it saves somewhere I can't find anywhere on my phone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saving in own album not showing in gallery."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Keeps freezing up"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Its good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mantullll bangettttt"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Loved this app until it stopped saving images. I can't find them anywhere. The album in settings is correct, but the images don't show in there. Please fix. I do really like this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"EDIT: 2021- This app is now trash. I profoundly resent being forced to be hostage to *30 SECOND* ads Will NOT save unless you do. Trash. 90% of anything that was good about this app is now behind a paywall or holds your phone hostage to excessively long ads. Trash. Original review: Did everything I've wanted without ads and b.s. I really like the collage plug in.. interestingly, I only originally downloaded this to crop, but it does have great, easy to use, intuitive features. New fave."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ap no longer supports my full version purchase from years ago Also doesnt save pics in gallery, have to seach phone for them, and then I cant share from pic to my social media.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I think you should review the Ads that appears on your App. very out of subject includes political persons and violence. shame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not good anymore since it is now a real pain to remember where the images are saved. On my Samsung S9, the excellent photo gallery app can't even find them, I have had to install a file directory app to move the pictures where they should be, IN A FOLDER READABLE BY THE ANDROID SYSTEM! And NO, the settings link seems not to allow me to change the folder location, I have tried. I will be looking out for another application to do what I want."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this used to be the BEST app for editing pictures and I wanted to use it for every picture I'd ever taken. then it started saving in 64x64 on the highest quality it could be and you could see every single pixel. still, that was better than what it is now as it doesn't even save the picture at all. don't even bother trying to use this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Seems I should play with this more"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashing again and again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Edit: After below reply from dev, fix turned out only temporary. The next two times I used the app, edited images disappeared & weren't saving again. Reinstalled the app again and it worked properly, but have decided to quit using the app now. Insane to expect users to uninstall-reinstall app everytime we need to use our saved images."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow nice app.that is the best free photo editor 😻😻😍😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤️❤️❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Happy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"MY PHONE GOT STOLEN, NEW PHONE, SUDDENLY FILTERS COST MONEY!? Not fair if it used to be free. FIX this shadiness or else keeping one star. FINDING a new editor! In response: YOU DON'T READ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"New version of Pixlr.. effects is not be good ..only default is there .. change and back to colour effect.. otherwise good and use the app .."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When I using this apk 2019 This apk Totally Free But Now 😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"What a wonderful program this is one don't waste your time on other stuff this one does the job quite well"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Only one i use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Takes forever and a day to load photos and has annoying ads, otherwise it'd be 5 stars.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great until update... The latest update, which was several weeks ago, no longer actually saves edited photos into any retrievable file on my phone...which makes the app useless. Before the update this was my favorite app to edit photos with. I'm now on the hunt for a replacement and am uninstalling Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nothing like the website, good for basic photos editing but same stuff your phone would have anyway"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Big issue with pixlr recently, when trying to save my work it says ""saved to pixlr album"" but when I check my gallery there's no saved pictures! So basically its not saving any pics! Please sort this bug.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for many years almost as long as I could remember having an Android phone it's always been a good app to be able to make subtle yet very compelling changes to my pictures and it makes them better for it thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The ads are a bit annoying but it does the job."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Why doesn't any of my edits save to my album anymore? It did it about a month ago, and then I updated it and it fixed it. Now there's no update and it's still doing it. Super annoying when it's telling me it's saved and it hasn't after I've edited several pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Way too many ads. Way too expensive for a subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very creative and useful app to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Everytime I tap on text and go back half of my screen is black and is unusable. Using Samsung galaxy s21 ultra."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Everytime the ads pop up at the top of the picture and i cant see what im doing, and if you tap the ad instantly it opens your browser you go back to the pic and its 10 seconds another ad pops up. Great app, poor ad placement. I dont need to be tricked into tapping the ad. Which is essentially why it pops up where it does so you hit it on accident."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing photo editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Making my phone shut down. I like this app. Didn't used to do that. But I'm sure it's an issue with Lineage OS version I'm on. Oh well. Guess I'll have to update at some point... Also... For people complaining about storage location: you can change it in settings."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Always hanging after a huge time of work and editing and during saving it stuck at 25% for ever, useless app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Extremely slow performance on latest gen kindle. Constant full screen ads are tiresome, but that's the price you pay for ""free"" apps. Some annoying things like not being able to make a collage directly from your Google photos account and slow erratic performance gets it 2 stars in my book."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have done great photo editing on this app, it's been my main app for years now. Has done everything I've chucked at it and the features are simple to find and use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The pictures don't even actually save to the gallery anymore. Super annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After recent update it's not working properly that's why I am giving 1 star only"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app is really a good one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Total suck app. Worked for years, even when I moved app to my SD card to save internal storage space. Had to reinstall app. Moved to SD card as previously done....Now it says ""app stopped working"". Constantly report issue to no avail. What is up here???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not saving photos after the update. Kindly fix it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Can't add additional pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pixlr files not saving to folder? The simple fix was to uninstall and reinstall the app. All went back to normal."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Images after editing not saving in device."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be my favourite. But now it can't even save. It says my photos are saved in Pixlr folder, yet nothing there. I have checked, all permissions are granted, so it's definitely not permission-related."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a nice little app. Now it's not saving my pics any more. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and now it's showing me ads and restore purchase isn't working. Bad form. I used to recommend purchasing ad free to everyone as it was super reasonable but I'm not down with subscription based software. Lol at the company saying I'm using a different account? I'm not. I can no longer save pics so the app is unusable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's the shiznit!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app 💜"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I Like Editing Lol"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app has been wonderful up until some recent stupid update that doesn't save images in a field viewable from your phone's image gallery. It's an image editing app and my gallery doesn't show the images once saved. I loved this app before this stupid update. Would have given it a 5-star. Glad I waited. Hopefully someone sees this and fixes the issue that has been there for weeks now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its a great experience to use, i reccomend"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"nice give more updates Some bugs pls fix it And sometimes it's not open."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GOOD APP"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app to make memes and I edit a lot of stuff online with it. It's awesome."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have used Pixlr for several years. It is easy & fun. Highly recommend it. THANKS Pixlr for a GREAT app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to love this app but recently my edits doesn't save in my album despite it saying it has. Tried countless of times. Quality is awful when editing too. Disappointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"fabulous free app, highly reccomended"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"A couple years ago I found this app and I used to make a lot of really cool memes and pictures with no texting over it with real meaning it's almost poetry I wrote. But I just downloaded again today to try to do it again and for some reason sorry Mr developer but you screwed this up it no longer writes in a, complete column form down the picture is one continuous sentence what the over?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It didnt do what I wanted"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a great app but recently there was a change in saving location, which did not allow me to see the edited pics in Gallery. Here is what to do if you're experiencing the same -> go to Pixlr Settings -> locate the Default save folder (take a screenshot so you can find your already saved photos) -> change the Default save folder to Downloads or another folder of your choice."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The only app that doesn't out right ask you to register an account! Thanks for this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Have tons of graphical bugs . What the heck lol"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app has officially been killed solely because of lack of care, and content, Very outdated, would not download."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app for patch removal or healing the spots in my perception. If there's any better app for patch/spots removal other than this, please suggest."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ever since I updated the app yesterday, pictures are not saving!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Has been my go-to editor since highschool. Recommended."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save your edits anymore. What's the point of even having this app now? Time to find another."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't explain how to fix scratches on photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very easy to use this aap.i liked it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Every time I try to edit my image or erasing any part of that image, My finger accidentally press back swipe and my whole efforts goes worthless. Kindly ask permission before going back. And kindly add a feature by that we can remove unnecessary part of image in a straight line(currently we can remove that part but we have to use point eraser I am talking about eraser which can eraser in straight line like a wiper)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use lots of fun to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As this being a ""editors choice"" app Im not satisfied..I downloaded to clear up some blurry pics and it never cleared...Wasted my time and efforts behind this choice."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am a photographer and the reason I deleted pixlr was because I was using it to add my watermark to my photos and the resolution of the photos are 6000x4000 aka 24.3 megapixels and it compressed my photo to 1080x720 which really distorted the details.📸📸📸 So I switched to Photoshop express and snapseed and they are incredible!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a couple of years now & I must say... I AM OBSESSED WITH IT!!!! I'm always on it all day... I love the cool features it gives you to choose from to apply different edits & how easy to use everything is too!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is nice app plz give me 5 star all people.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saved images. However .... where are they??? Nowhere. Not in gallery or Pixlr folder? 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Please bring back the ability to save on android. I geniunely enjoyed using this apps and have made hundreds of photos on here."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app... Using it for last 5 years and have made super cool creatives on the work and social front...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Constantly removes touchable icons and covers half of the screen in black on the Note 20 Ultra."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Hi Good day Before the update I was Able to see my Pixlr Folder with my photos now I can't see the folder while selecting photos through the app.. It's Annoying me ...😠Please Fix"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I tried save PNG image with transparent background, but sadly it added black background itself. I've double check everytime i'm about to save the image but the same problem is still there. I'm using android 11 with snapdragon 865."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app to edit low quality pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I Likes it a lots"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is currently not working, will not save images after editing, they just vanish"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"EDIT: Settings > Restore Purchase from the same Google Play account doesn't work, as suggested by the dev below. Also emailed the dev but they offered the same fruitless solution. ORIGINAL: I purchased this years ago, but now it fails to restore historic purchases, wants to charge me again & show me ads. Also, photos appear not to save, but they are saved in a location that doesn't appear in the gallery. I had to go to Settings & change the Default save folder to DCIM/Restored to access them."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Where the hell are my save file ?? File save but nowhere to be found."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app suck so bad now! Can't do ANYTHING due to ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"How about 0? That's what I'm thinking about now... I just reinstalled as per your replies to others and when I tapped on restore purchases it said I don't have any to restore? I paid for add removal and quite a few packs from every section before you got GREEDY! And, restarting and clearing cache didn't help! I'm not buying the “It's Android/Google” BS. When your software stops working properly it's your job to fix it, not make excuses or blame others."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Jts nice apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and this is the only time I'm having a problem with it. I can't seem to upload certain pictures from the mobile app itself. I will need to go to Gallery, select the image I want then share it to Pixlr. I cannot use your Double Exposure feature as well which is my favorite. It lags everytime everytime even if I re-install the app. Is there something wrong? Hoping someone could help me on this. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I used to love this app until it stopped saving the pictures to the pixlr folder like it's done for years. Idk what changed, but not being able to save my pictures makes the app pointless. Samsung galaxy s9. Please fix. I want my app back!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"just like every other app no app to stretch pictures 1 star uninstalled hope you go bankrupt"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"With the new update, i have been using this to make collages, and when i tap save to my device, it does not actually save like???? This app is broken."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Use this app since 5-6 years ago. Can't save edited picture on our own phone is a fatal policy. Consider you lost loyal user like me and billion others because of that. Edit: Upgrade back to 5* Finally can save in directory I choose."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"App is not working properly now..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Hope to improve."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've used this app along time to edit small things from a photo. Just a suggestion... Remove the double tap to zoom feature. This gets super annoying when trying to do small dots as it zooms in and out and there's no way to control it. The pinch to zoom is perfectly fine so the double tap isn't even needed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Glitchy as heck"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Currently with the last update I can't open up and of my previous art I've made some from a week ago too about 9 months ago. Hope you can help"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice to use • functions & performance • If you have saving problems then: open Pixlr > Settings(top ¤ left) > Default save folder(by pushing ■folder icon till folder list shows up to chose: Downoads DCIM Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like this one a lot"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It used to be a great free app. Lately when you save an edited pic, it saves as the original pic, not the edited version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since I canceled my trial the app will not let me complete a photo without blacking out half the screen and forcing me to quit where I am. I have to delete what I was in the middle of and start all over again. I used to LOVE this app and have used it for years. It seems I might have to check out alternatives."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app with all editing needs you want really appreciate"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to save the photos after edited."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Amazing app but for whatever reason recently you just cannot save photos. I've found some roundabout ways to save photos like exporting to Snapchat first but it's really annoying. Please fix it asap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Like all the recent reviews says, recently, edited pics on pixrl can't be found anywhere. After trying to reset save settings multiple times, I finally found a folder where my edited pixrl pics start to appear again. I clicked on DCIM / CAMERA. Then the saved work appeared in my photo gallery."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Rubbish, everything in Google Play is rubbis, trillions of crabby ads, crabby Apps, rubbish rubbish rubbish....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not bad , but a bit hard to work .. it took me a long time to do 3 pics."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite photo editor app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very baddddd"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The tools get disappeared after few stages of effect didnt had the issue earlier but now it doesnt shows editing tools and some levelers like opacity controller pen and eraser size adjuster becomes double and its irritating"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Keeps deleting my stuff"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app has been the best photo editing app by far, however recently I can't save edited photos to the gallery and the ads are more annoying than ever before. Time to look elsewhere I'm afraid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Gladly uninstalled the app, after recent updates started spewing full-page ads every time I type in custom image size dimensions before saving. Also, the app started saving images at a really weird location that's not picked up by my phone's Gallery app."

Find your edits here: internal storage/Android/data/com.pixlr.express/files/Pixlr - You can see/use pics from this folder. They don't show in Gallery but you may be able to add to Gallery from excluded folders? ONLY 2 STARS due to confusion :( *Pixlr explanation NOT clear! Android no longer allows them to store in any folder outside of their app data folder. This is reason for change. Pics are on your device under file above. It was very hard to find :{"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer saves photos. I've saved multiple photos with this new version. They are not on my device. I've searched using the files app for all files with "".jpg"" and the only ones found were old ones made with the old version. No other jpgs exist on my device. No photos in my gallery either. They just aren't there. This app is currently broken."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😘😘"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Whenever I'm doing a collage, it takes a lot of time. It says ""Saving, please wait..."" and it will last for more than a minute, I even got as far as waiting for 10 minutes since I don't want to lose my progress. It's frustrating. Please fix this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I love how creative I can get with this app... totally so happy with! Thanks for being free and awesome! Update: not stoked on how many options have been switched to the ""pro"" version..I can live with that.. but lately its not even saving my images at ALL!!! Not so happy with that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest.update now longer saves images. The auto-response spam reply to the reviews is telling people ""images are now saved in my photos folder"".... um.... NO THEY'RE NOT! In fact, that aren't anywhere. After many years without problems, this app is now junk. I'm now looking for a replacement. It's a shame they used to be one of the very best. Let's hope they fix this."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Hi so ive used the app for well over a year now. Its awesome but as of a few days ago it saves my pics to my files and not to my camera roll. Any ideas why?"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've been using Pixlr, both Desktop and mobile app for several years now, but the mobile app is no longer saving my edits. I can't really send a screenshot as advised on other reviews, as its a case of the app saying they are saved but they aren't. I had to share a picture to twitter and save it there in order to not lose work. Once the bug mentioned is fixed I will gladly give Pixlr its usually deserved 5 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"From year i was totally into this app but from last month im facing lots of issues n bugs ; # Huge amount of crashes 😓 . . Still i love this app Please rectify issues soon . . 💐😊 Regards to team . . 🙇🏻‍♂️"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Been using this for years, one of the best photo editing software. I really miss the Windows 7 version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to work great. It was my goto for editing photos. It suddenly stopped saving my edits. I crop a photo. Save it. It vanishes. It is like I did nothing. I'm now looking for a replacement app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When using the healing function, a blue stain appears on the saved photo, where the tool was used, so not usable anymore for me."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app as my only editing app for years now and have NEVER had an issue and it simple to use. I rated it a few years back and just thought how this app is 1 of the 1st I download once I've gotten a new phone. I wanted 2 take the time out to say thank u 4 this app also, def recommend it for those 1ho don't use it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Anyone like Jeff"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ww"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I'd give this 5 stars as it's by far the best graphics app. But the ads are so intrusive and sneaky now, it's becoming impossible to use. When you go to save a picture a full-screen ad swipes through at the last second to catch us out. The ads at the top are so near functions that I give up. Best app available as well. Outshines all others by far. Apart from the ads, which are killing any usage. Such a shame."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The resolution became really bad. Blur"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is beautiful, don't get me wrong. It has plenty of powerful tools and functions that make it a solid package, but there's just one tiny yet huge problem: saving your work. I have no idea why this happens, since it's seemingly random, but every now and again, I'll save my work and it'll be hopelessly blurry, like it's 1/10 of the resolution of what I had saved. Older versions of the app don't have this problem, so I'm at a total loss. Please fix this ASAP."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not work, properly. Stop the function anytime."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trash, crashed on a stock Pixel 3Xl on just the second use. Multiple visual and pixel (ironically) bugs, not a stable app. Cannot believe this is what passes as highly rated just bc it's free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The adds make the app not work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years now. I love this app I make Christian Wallpapers all the time I use this app to make them then I upload them to zedge this app is amazing wouldn't trade it for anything"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App was gr8 it now sucks !!!!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, no pop up ads. This is a very great app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's really effective but the damn UI keeps disappearing a minute into editing each image, so I kind of have to press on the screen from memory and pray I'm clicking in the right area. It doesn't seem like there's anywhere to save progress so I can't just exit and refresh when this happens."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My good experience with this App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Very few options available compared to online"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ADS are making the APP FREEZE. IT is Soooooooo aggravating. Started happening about 6 months ago. It makes the program worthless. Unfortunately. It used to be my go-to favorite. Now I'm tearing my hair out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Fudu app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very lacking even in essential features like the ability to copy and paste and work with layers, or even to simply resize the image, yet bloated with useless ""features"" like frames and preset filters. Makes Microsoft Paint look like Photoshop by comparison. Useless app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"নাইচ"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gerat app,,, but in latest update saving image taking too much time, don't know why,, in galaxy s9. Please fix."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I want to update my review, I didn't realize they have a very affordable plan for $7.99 a year that removes all ads and it is so worth it. I'll be keeping your app after all and just upgraded because it is a good editing app and that's a great price. Thanks!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Usually a five star rating for the limited functions I need for servicing my photos, but the black square occupying the bottom of the app after I add text, now, has made the app completely non-functioning. I cannot use an app if the function buttons not only disappear, but their original location is obscured by a black square not previously there. Galaxy Note 10."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very cool editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's nice"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photoediting app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Data hack application don't install this application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I love this app and use it all the time but the last few updates have made it so glitch that I'm losing my edits which is understandably frustrating. There's a pop up screen that should have editing options in it but it doesn't, it's a blank screen with no options so you either save what you have and try again or try to escape out of it. Please fix asap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's fantastic app..."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Seems to be a lot of current bugs. Editing menus/functions randomly dissappear while editing. Edits disappear without warning. Picture opening process completely different than last time I used and seems buggy. (I use this app a lot and have never had issues like these before.)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good for basic photo edition. Used to be better - now it requires internet connectivity and it started charging ££ for things that used to be free (and, IMO, aren't so amazing as to be worth the expense)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Slow, buggy, and missing key features."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good photo editor!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awsm"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing and Will not open"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its good for stuff yk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I was half expecting to see advertising being splashed across the app! It's snappy and works well despite seeing 👑 which means that you pay for those features. The user interface seems a little naked when comparing it to others, but less clutter works well."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"If I store the app in internal storage, the app opens but if I store the app in external storage it doesn't open"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not working properly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I loved this app. I did so much with it! Then it just stopped working. I check to see it needed an update, I uninstalled it then reinstalled it twice. Still wouldn't work. Now I'm having to try to find a photo editor app that's even remotely close to this one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I am having an issue. Randomly my screen will suddenly be just black on the bottom half. The ""buttons"" are still there because if I click in the general area I can sometimes still manage to finish adding text or whatever I was doing. I have tried reinstalling the app and it didn't fix it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ads are very annoying! It got worse this month. I'd purchase the full version but I don't use Google for payments."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for years now and It has no issues. This app is very well made and suits for all of my needs to edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"After updating my samsung phone m21s app stop in between while editing the photo Issue unresolved from a month Request to kindly look into the matter"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Edit: if this is true about only email being compromised then I will return this app to the 4 star rating it deserves... Great app as it always was, thanks for being transparent and forthcoming. I hope the breach has only made you and your team more meticulous about security and nothing like this happens going forward. It's a great app, always has been. I'm sorry this happened to your company. Let's build back stronger."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Everytime"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be the best free photo editing app out there, then they put in very poorly integrated ads and started charging for offline use. Also, for no apparent reason, the resolution gets shot to hell if you crop your image, even if you select the maximum resolution, resulting in grainy, unreadable images replete with jpeg artifacts. The sad thing is, there probably still isn't a better free option. If there is, I hope I find it! Edit: uninstalling and reinstalling the app didn't fix it! 2 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app Next level app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app of editing pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Circular policy and overlapping dates for key policy and access features. Will proceed with caution knowing 'acceptance' before use while logged in is/are to Pixlr policies that are not enforcible. Note continued use of the app has been dictated by others (issues with stock Photos and Gallery app on my device."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good and easy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Winsome, lovely."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Does your tech team sit around and talk about how they could completely ruin the experience of users? Well, I have to say they really topped themselves when they add LOUD SOUND to the ads that interfere with trying to save a edited photo! Why would anyone BUY your product, when you have total disregard for users?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this app, I have not one complaint"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Dont know what happened it keeps crashing"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Helps you greatly for editing pictures, images in various formats. Looks very helpful, but surely can improve with quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Thanks for the previous help. Now Your advertisement script is messing with the program. It loads advertisements when I'm trying to save the picture. And over lays in the save panel. It also is closing the keyboard and leaving a black area where the keyboard should be. So I'm not able to do anything but lose all the edits and restart the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Very limited fint types,other than that it's ok. But if you're looking for vibrant fonts this app Is not for you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and has loads of features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I love this app but it keeps crashing. So irritating. The collage can be annoying too because it doesn't show the full image in it's square. Sometimes when collage is used it will mess with the images when you save it so one or more pictures in the collage look really stretched. It's strange."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excelent"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this application for almost 5 years without any major problems. And I would rate it a 4-Star app. However, it keeps on stopping today while opening. Is there a bug that needs to be fixed?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As a professional graphic artist I gotta say this App is perfect for most if not all professional graphics. That was then. This is now. Keep it moving this app sucks anymore 😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love It"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Works well for the minimal use i need it for. But whenever i muck up I have to delete the whole thing and start again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't size the text"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's disappointing to read responses from developers that say things like ""Its your phone not our app"". Now while this may be true, that's not good business practice. As an owner myself, I know full well the customer isn't always right. But you NEVER say that to them. Personally i can't belive i can't get a refund for an incorrect charge. So it keeps me happy to come here and warn others Is only $8 but it's the principle behind it. I'm just waiting to hear 'you never requested a refund' ""That'll make me laugh so hard,! PREVIOUS - It's interesting that after testing the app and deciding it wasn't for me and ultimately cancelling within the trail period that the card i HAD to register with was rooting an attempted charge. It's only $8, but it's mine not yours! Get out of my wallet!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Complicated to save. One touch save required"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A great editing app. I've created some real cool images with this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've always used pixlr to make the best photo edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Bbbooooo...I've been using this app for a long while now. Loved it.....but now, when I am in the middle of working on a photo, it stops working and will shrink the pic and all the buttons disappear. All my work gets lost and I have to start all over. Uninstalling, re-installing doesn't work. I've lost more work on this app lately than I have on other apps in years. If this cannot be resolved, I will have to find another app to do my work on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashes upon open. Cleared cache and data."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr used to be brilliant... But now, You can't even use it offline - wonderful - when I've got too much month left at the end of the data, I like to use the downtime to do some editing! And what's all this subscription nonsense Pixlr? Just like all the other greedy editing apps out there - do many using the same business model, it's becoming nigh on Impossible to find a good honest aop. get back to your roots, Pixlr - the serious photo editing tool you once were... Poor show 🙄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App can't even open anymore. 3/17/21"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it works well"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Download if you want to sit through 25 second ads with sound just terrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Every time I do a collage, it is so long to save the output pic. Fix this. This is not anymore the app i was using for years now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I loved this app. But I have had to uninstall it twice now in the last top-three weeks. It just keeps closing on me and or won't open at all saying Pixlr has stopped. I would like nothing more than to reinstall, but..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's incredibly good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love your app as I use it DAILY but now you've changed it to where the stupid ad for Walmart pops up randomly to where it ruins what I've done and I have to start all over again. Now I'll be looking for a new app. I've tried to grin and bear it but it did it again a few minutes ago mid way of doing something important and now I'm pissed! Bye To reply to your comment: I understand why you do ads and didn't mind them prior. It's the timing that they pop up! Thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is an amazing app, the free stuff is worth rhe download and id like to purchase the full version, but it seems like every week the app breaks and i have to uninstall and reinstall..."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"bad bags"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let me save image, supposedly no storage space and no directory, both false, so stupid and useless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was the best app and the best website. Now its cluttered with adds, slow, and lacks all the tools that once made it great. It needs to go back to add free and simple microsoft paint style UI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good app. But please add an Undo button functionality so that whenever I make a mistake, I can just undo a step instead of tapping X or cancel and start over editing a photo again. It's kinda frustrating doing so when you almost completed your edited photo. Hope this will be added very soon or within the next update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fanstactic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super se upar"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Hi everyone love this app but I uninstalled many apps for this app and it still takes 1 hour to download and I installed pixlr on an other device it takes 1 hour so please fix this app but otherwise its a great app love it and please fix so this app is better at installing love please fix 😊😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I loved this app and use it for all of my edits for my side business, but the last few days it keeps crashing. It wont even open. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times. Not sure what is going on. If all goes back to normal it will get 5 stars! I would LOVE LOVE to be able to blur in spots with my stylus like I can brighten for example, instead of a set circular or bar blur pattern."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years already. Sorry that this is just my first time having my review for this app. The interface is very user-friendly. Easy to use and very efficient. Most of the photo-editing effects are already in here."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Booyah"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I rely on this wonderful photo editing app. It clearly enhances and improves images and the corrections are outstanding, especially with blurred pics."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best free photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I AM FURIOUS!!!!!!! THIS IS A FREE SCAM! THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL! WORST APP EVER! I TRY AND TRY TO EDIT MY USA MAP, BUT EVERYTIME I PICK AN IMAGE, IT SENDS ME BACK TO THE APPLICATION'S MENU SCREEN, I AM SHOCKED BY THIS. IF I COULD GIVE IT -75774 STARS OUT OF 5 I WOULD. so dog water out of ten, if I may."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Meh!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this App for years & Absolutely love it, but for some reason the past 2 months or so it has NOT WORKED PROPERLY, ACTUALLY It has NOT WORKED AT ALL! When I try to open the app. it does not respond."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Didnt fix the fuzziness of my photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gajjjjjb"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Here you say, no account creation just download and enjoy it. But i can't open offline editing. Everytime it show ""enjoying pixlr offline, subcribe now"" why???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of my favourite editors. Powerful yet easy to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"For now I like what I see, I haven't encountered any problem whatsoever."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this app is good its so nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years now. Its one of the best app for teaking out photos and other stof."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Doodle is not working now these days... Fix it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Butful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Wow. So Pixlr did the ultimate bait and switch with a subscription model. Whilst I am more than happy to pay a one time fee, I do not use subscription-based apps, it just gets too expensive. I've been a long time user and I'm very disappointed at this change."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Not better 😂 bakar ha no . Data waste ha o Like kar"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I usually add text to my photos for a watermark, and everytime I try to add a text the app glitches and I can't continue editing. This happens everytime I use it, even when I restart multiple times it'll continue to happen and it's incredibly frustrating. I literally can only edit one photo a day when I need to edit a bunch because the app only allows me to add text once a day. I love the app but the fact that this has been a continuous problem for so long has me rating this low."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"A really good overall app. It helps me whether I am using it on a personal or business level. I myself use this on chromebook except chromebook has a browser version which runs more consistently. Otherwise this app is great for mobile devices and tablets."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best Editing App, subtle and simple does the job"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I came back to edit my review and it's no longer here. I had a 5172x5172 pixel photo that I edited and when I went to save it my maximum resolution I could save it as was 600x600. Developer responded that I could choose a custom resolution, which I had in fact tried, but wasn't allowed to go above 600x600. It's a little odd that I knew it didn't work and the developer didn't. It's a fair app. Just this one thing gets frustrating when you're trying to edit photos to promote your podcast and book."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Topnotch app!! 👍🌹"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great editing tools for single images, double exposure & the text tool have great functionality, and the ads are totally worth it seeing as how few there are. No 5 stars because the collage tool is absolutely abysmal!! It's impossible to simply combine to pictures full resolution, it crops and you never see the original full image in a pixlr collage. If there was an option to just stack images next to/one top of another the app would be genuinely perfect."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Using it for almost a year but the new version is worst. Can't save photos in high resolution. Always popping ""try to save in lower size"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful app for phone editing 👌"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have loved this app for years but so many recent changes were making it harder to use it like I'd want to, and now I can't get it to open on my mobile device at all. There are a few other apps I could try, but I'd honestly rather use what I know and have always liked. Please work this bug out soon."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"PC app very good. Mobile app not that good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I used this app all the time. Its a great editor for photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Loved it more than any app i had and promoted it heavily to everyone. My entire family used it. I didn't even use any other photo app. Now, I HATE IT. The stupid subscription to use offline is dumb and I have no cell signal or wifi at my house at all bcuz I live far away from town in the mountains, so now I can never even use the app anymore unless I go to town. You COMPLETELY RUINED the best photo app there was. So disappointed."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is a very good app for picture editing with lots of options but one issue that prevents me from fully using this is the font editor - unable to change color. the only color appearing is black and white regardless of the preferred color. Also, once text is finalized but a change of mind occurred, text cannot be moved or edited and the only option is to create a new one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Are you kidding me with 16 second ads to save?!? *Uninstalled*"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"If you know how to utilize all of its awesome features, this is one of the best photo editing apps on the phone. I do really wish you would be able to save the files and PNG format though. I do a lot of photo manipulation, so I do save file after save file or layer after layer and you can lose image quality pretty quickly."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"When I first tried this app years ago. It was an absolute 10+ stars. But with the recent ""Subscribe offline, which prevents you from even using the app. I had too upload an old version of Pixlr from a different source, I still had too download the extra features, but nonetheless the app works great once again. These new updates are just a hassle and still changes the image resolution, crashes, and or wants you too pay. Should have just left it alone. Don't fix it if it ain't broken."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The app is simply wonderful. I have used it through 2018 all the way to the present. I cannot stress enough how good this app is for on the go photo editing. I have never met a crash or a lag spikes, the UI is smooth and easy to understand."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cancelled my subscription as you can't sort the payment issues out.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"V good for you i make my photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I was in need of an on-the-go editing program, and Pixlr Mobile fit everything I needed. There are some features that only the browser version has, such as adding your own font and the fill bucket, but for the most part everything I could need is available. I don't use the app regularly enough to warrant buying the ad-free version, but the ads aren't very distracting. My only problem is it hasn't been saving pictures, stating it can't create the save file, which only started recently."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Constant freezing and very slow!! I don't know what's going on with this app as of lately but it is not performing well at all. The app is constantly freezing and its also erasing my work while I'm doing it!! Very stressful to use. Not happy."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Now to start off, i'd hate to give it 2 stars but it had to, and let me tell you my reason's. One to start off with it's very hard to navigate once you start editing i mean the list of stuff is all there in all but it's pretty hard to move around when your drawing and stuff ect. 2 there's not much opptines when your putting in a filter which kinda sucks, yes yes i know there's somewhat enough choice's but it's just kinda tight in my opinion. 3 in all it's just hard to use for me, in all."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can only load 10 photos in the collage so why say it can do up to 25 if it can only do 10."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"8 out of 10 times this app gets stuck on ""saving..please wait"" message and I have to force close it and start editing anew. Very frustrating.

It's been my go-to editing app for years as it's normally so easy to use but recently the colour palette is completely unpredictable and most pictures are polarised when I load them into the app so it's impossible to edit them accurately. It's like I have to work in negative! Gutted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super appp"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Everytime I try to write text on to the picture the app glitches. It stops working and half of my screen turns black. Its extremely annoying because it does thar every time and every time I have to close the app and open it again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I don't have enough words to praise the developer for this app. I am a photographer and though for dslr photos its Photoshop, for all my mobile clicks I am using Pixlr for years now. Its easy to use and gives satisfactory images. Double Exposure and Pen / Erase option with almost all features really helps in tweaking results. Great job guys, really great job ! If possible do bring out a Video Edit App."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for over a year and use it almost daily but now it is giving me problems when adding text to photos. I will add the text and then while trying to change the text font or color the whole tool/task bar just goes black and there is no way to get it to go away."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Cannot save file on android 11, can this be resolved?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved this app very much because it was like a small photoshop for me but today this app only works online ( I don't know why did they choose like that ) and now it takes too much time to save photos and if I don't have network this app becomes useless . So to the makers if you can make it work offline it will be helpful for us . I think there is no another app I find similar to yours ..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After locking some of the features behind a paywall forcing people to pay up, the Pixlr database breach that happened today(22 Jan 2021)leaking highly sensitive user information clearly confirms that they have no regards for their users or their security and privacy, and are only in it for the money."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So far it works just fine for me"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The devs have added a nonsensical machine translation to the Swedish version which makes it very difficult to use. At least I hope it's a machine translation, because otherwise they got scammed by someone pretending to be a translator. For example, ""splash"" is translated into ""stink"" (and yes, that means the same thing in Swedish). As it is now, you have to change the language of your phone to English to understand the app."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite photo editing app. But the last several times I tried to use it, it won't even load the photos. It's a shame. I've used it for several years. I deleted it moments ago. There are newer and better options that work great."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sat Sahib Ji 🙏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice editing software"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Once upon a time there was an app called Pixlr Xpress(had a blue icon) that was the best app to edit photos that I had ever used. I ended up having to get a new phone and went to install the app again and could not find it but this one instead which is no where near the comparison but has to be related the icon is the same only the other one was blue....what happened?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app recently comes with half black window when trying to edit pictures. Not sure what happened. Hope this can be fixed. Thanks."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't save my photos, I can't upload them to Twitter or Instagram (it keeps saying I need to 8nstall both, which I already have them installed?), and without being able to ssve the photos to my phone, this app is COMPLETELY USELESS. What's the point of having this app if you can't even use the photoa you edit? Uninstalled. So glad I didn't buy the subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"† , rlly nice, there's a lot of aesthetic font nd stuff, its more of like an unique kind of app I LOVE IT! recommended! Well actually I use my desktop soo yea Im gonna try it out on MOBILE!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"There's no option to increase canvas size!! Edit: Yes, I love Pixlr X. I use it quite often. But, I have also used Pixlr M & the option to increase canvas size is available there. So, why not on the app?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love the offline ability to edit and creatively make collages and love this app love love love edit 1-12-21 still love this app for offline features you can download while in service as well as save and use while offline.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Facing lot of problems after last update... There are few ads after which the app hangs.... Also it refreshes frequently and all work done is lost.... We cannot save on every move..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing 👏🏻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was good , but now it is just hell"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Works great on my phone(Samsung Galaxy A50), but have not tried it on my Chromebook yet. No issues on phone though and love the features!! Premium user."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this for YEARS. Recently got a new phone and loaded the app from Google play store. To my disappointment, some of the options that were included are now charged for. Quite disappointed. They want $8 a year for stuff that's free on my other device. Hmm...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"add free size croping"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why can't I use the pen feature anymore? Even when I try to change it it just switches back to eraser"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be very good. The one big issue: is NO WAY to resize text after editing. Boooo!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Facing this problem after using of 2 years, : Crash , app not working properly even cant edit for more that 15-20 seconds. And every time i restart edit but again same problem... Not able to edit anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I cant get it to do anything. Its stupid."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Blah blah blah"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It was really good until something strange has happened. I found out that I can not save the picture with the original HD quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be an ok editor, now has ads and wants a subscription payment"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was a favourite app to use for edits and I used it almost daily for an art challenge last year. Even with the ""can't use offline"" update (which btw is still such an unnecessary update and just shows how little regard you had for your users. Not everyone has or can afford a good connection/phone). Since last month, it just straight up stopped working. Selecting it brings up nothing but a ""Pixlr stopped working"". Is this app not available anymore then? Are you removing it from the store?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I hope you fixed problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This has been really good to create photo edits of characters. My only gripes are: 1. The fact when you use a filter on a transparent photo it creates an unwanted background 2. I can't use it offline without getting a subsceiption Otherwise this is an incredible app and I would give it five stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have used the app on various Android phones for years and love it. Suddenly, on my Google Pixel 3, it won't let me save my changes to images, giving me an error message. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it won't work anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"STUPID"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best photo editor I've found🎨"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updates Killed it. Too many Ads and EVERYTHING requires an internet connection. How stupid!! Update after response from Developer: (1* before, 1* now too)🛑 Guys, it's not the Ads, it's your Requiring Internet For EVERYTHING that kills your app. CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE APP WITHOUT INTERNET...!!! That's crazy. (Read the room, everybody is complaining about this!)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Update on my issue with the double exposure option; it works normally once again so I'm assuming it was random bug, what it was exactly was that I can add a image but couldn't mess with the size or rotate it around but it works again Points for the devs responding and reminding me about it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The app itself is ok but I have a serious problem with sharing photos from this app to other apps. Once I modify a photo it happens that I can share it only a ""direct"" on Instagram or only to whatsapp. It doesn't give me other options!!! It happens very frequently and only if I am lucky I can see other apps option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best Editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This APP helps me very much in many ways. But, 21st font in RETRO category is not working. The previous font was good. Now that font is not available for me in Samsung S20 FE mobile. Please fix it. Better to add some more Filters, Font Packs, Editing Options and Possible developments. Anyway Thanks for the APP. 🥰 P I X L R ❣️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it!!! 💜❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Could you add cutouts from pixlr x or bring back pixlr x for mobile, pixlr m isn't that great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's buggy, full of ads, and rarely even saves the finished images. 😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the best photo editing app I've ever found with many options for free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I know the app is best."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't use offline? There are plenty of apps that don't require their users to watch a full minute of video ads to use the app. You can even use it in airplane mode. This app is junk, run by greedy jerks. Uodate: Thanks for the reply. As I said, there are plenty of editing apps that use ads in a far less abrasive way. Don't be so greedy; maybe users would continue to use your product, thus making you money. You don't make money if you chase all your users away with ridiculously intrusive ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Divali photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Unfriendly interface. No way to blur parts of a photo. No option to draw?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It the best for me❤ i love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good , but cannot save image in pixlor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app, but it will not allow me to use the text feature because it makes the bottom screen ""disappear"", and I literally have to exit the app or move to another app to come back into it, but still will not let me add text. Please fix, thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Daaamn redownloaded this and it's got worse. UI for isn't intuitive, sometimes broken and just not worth it as there are better apps out there now Edit: No thanks, but maybe look at a getting better QA team?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Don't know why it's automatically close in several time. I'm using it in different time in different devices. Recently my new Android 10 device's update may have some bugs. Hopefully pixlr team fix it soon. I will give you the 5★. Couse it's trust."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The recent update both implimented a net-only experience, which makes absolutely no sense, AND causes file manager crashes left and right. Used to use pixlr for a LONG time, but the new update has pretty much rendered it unusable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App won't all me to save or post to IG anymore. It's no longer useful until it's fixed. I've given it a couple of months since it stopped working but still not fixed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite thing on the internet!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not user friendly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good application i love it💕💕"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is so nice editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Greate but just wish the outline of white (when you fill) wasn't their"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"old features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Interface is not common. Manual adjustment option is limited but mostly useful. Overall it is Good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There is no way to resize text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great simple photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"1 star for latest update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I just wish all the features are ready to use, and not have to download them separately. Like the font styles, etc. Just have them all ready upon installation. Thanks anyway"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for a long time & it's great, but this morning I try to open it & every time it says 'Pixlr Has Stopped' & it won't open. What am I to do now? Is this because of recent updates? Do I have to re-install? Please help. Thanks :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have used this for years a great layout for beginners as well as more advanced."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good app for photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the BEST apps I've ever had. I use it to make book covers for an app called Wattpad (I know its not the purpose but yeah lol) and its SO SO SO SO amazing! I give it 5 stars, if I could I would give it 1000000000+ stars 😆"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update deteriorated performance of this app. There are bugs everywhere. Whenever I add a small picture through double exposure option. It made that added picture blurry and pixelated. Please fix the error."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Its becoming more difficult to use with changes app developer doing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste app never. Waste of download"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Little irritated that I am being asked to pay now when the title still says Free.. Dang, you were a 5. I'd rather have ads and only ads. So everything I did have access to is now charged..? Borders and stickers were free until I updated. Why the change? Isn't that what the ads are for? My other applications give a choice. Pay and have access or watch the ads and have access. You are basically saying I have to pay or the other option is I have ads but still no features.. got it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's a good app but no offline functions at all and no full price buying option. Just pointless monthly payments for nothing special."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Undo the full collage resolution, please. It was ca 5000x4000Px before some updates an it's ca only 821x1079 Px now. Some details are missing. Why this restrictions? 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Where is the option to make the image squarefit?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Coo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome designs and tons of features. Very easy to make cool creations!! Been using this app for almost 8 years.... Love, love, love it. Easy to use and awesome results!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why image max size problem please help me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Went from 4 stars to 1 star after most recent update. Too many glitches to list. Trying a different app. ✌️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The new update no longer allowed me to save a picture in HD quality, or choose a quality at all, and it now only saves photos in a lower quality than what they are originally when you import them. Completely useless now!!!!!! Change it back!!!!!! 😠 Edit: the problem resolved on it's own, I'm not sure how. I've been using this app for years and it's always been my favorite. Thanks for the response, sorry for the trouble."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I hate to give it a bad review because I have used this app successfully in the past for years, but the new update has killed it. I can't save edited photos without getting an error message. ***UPDATE*** After hearing back from the developer they seem to have fixed the problem and it works great now after deleting the app and reinstalling it. Thank you for the response and suggestion."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Photos often rotate counter clockwise when opening. App is clunky - it takes several taps to do simple editing. I've noticed, the contrast slider is not continuous at 0. it's either on or off. - 1 and 1 still changes the image noticeably."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice tool for photo editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible, these ""updates"" ruined it all. Glitch time line changed it and now I don't have low, medium, high settings. There's only a slider that speeds up the glitch animation, you ruined the entire app, also 90%of all 90%of your features are all PayToUse be more fair and give us atleast some more to work with Otherwise it would have been a perfect app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It is resizing to smaller resolution."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Audio ads are extremely loud and invasive. Resolution gets screwed up with layering. I'd rate significantly higher if every time I saved it didn't blow out my ears with an add of a child's voice screaming. Extremely irritating way for an otherwise passable app to go"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer able to save. Can't even change save location. Was working fine before. 🙈"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It was my favourite online picture editing program - still have a hope you will fix it.. PLEASE ☺️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Works. Free. Can't complain"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"After several years of this app working beautifully, it has recently not allowed me to share my edited photos; or, at least not without them being severely blurred. In the past I had been able to share edited photos - as they looked in the app - without a problem. Please fix."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best only one is all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The result of the pictures I edited through this app is never like before. After I try the heal option(that can remove unnecessary spots on your face) and save my picture, there are gray stains on the areas where the spots were located. It's very annoying since I used this app for a very long time. Now, I think I gotta uninstall this one and try another apps that works better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"But while saving the texts are blurring"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app from last 3 years but the recent updates totally ruined the app. Not able to use it offline, the maximum resolution of images decreased and so many ads. Not worthy app now, just uninstalling it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer able to save edits!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Can you add the Fringe effect for the mobile, please?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm uninstalling this app. After years of great service, devs decide to screw it all up. I'm no longer able to use it offline, not even for something as simple as saving a file. Thanks for the good times, but a subscription is not worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After the last update, the splash tool no longer works. You can select a color, but you can't actually splash anything with that color. After seeing other reviews, I see there are a whole bunch of other bugs now, too. Maybe you guys should just undo the update and go back to the last version. It would be a lot easier than fixing all the bugs."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Just OK"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Too many things need a Premimum membership; I preferred the older versions. There are other editor apps that are free (or almost free) and just as good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but when I added it again I couldn't see or open the templates. I don't want to give it a bad rating but I have to. I will find another photo editor. And I just don't want to have to keep messing around with this thing just for it to work properly. I don't mind if you try to fix this issue but to me I don't care because I don't plan to come back to his application any time soon."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After using the app for bout 3 years it cant open when I try to open it. Unindtalled and reinstalled it, no changes. Cleared all app data, no changes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's a nice app for me 👐"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤❤ I wanted to make a gaming logo and this was the best app for it and it had all the features i needed for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Such a shame. I've used this app for years. After uninstalling and reinstalling it still hasn't fixed the save option after I've edited. When putting text on a photo it doesn't have the 'done' option at the top anymore. Think I'm going to have to find something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It no longer exports full resolution. I've now moved on to use Collage Maker."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app works OK, but now shows long ads when I save. There are already constant ads on the workspace, which is acceptable. Forced ads that run longer than 1 second get an automatic downvote from me. Shame on you, pixlr!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not a fan, nothing different than the pre installed camera app on my Samsung Note... Very disappointing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've always loved Pixlr because it's offline, now it's requiring me to go online to use it or subscribe for a premium/paid version."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great apk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Amazing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice I want to die nice app 👉📱 Wowwwww 2020 date24 today 6 :40 pm"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Only works online now because they claim they need the ad revenue from intrusive, data stealing ads. I've been using this app for years. Suddenly it's no longer working, I can't choose the size of the photo I want to save, half the screen disappears & begins flickering when I try to add text & now there are so many ads. Re-installing didn't help. Greed took over another good app, uninstalling. :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Where are the pictures I save?! They no longer save to my gallery, I can't find them"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was one time the best but now it is less than trash. You can't edit anymore without having internet data. The output is blurry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for years, and now it won't let me save the photos in original size any longer. All the sudden this app became completely useless. It's going into the bin... 🙄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالی😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"i just wanted to put text over a photo, cant adjust size of photo and user interface is very hard to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Too many new things. Not as easy to navigate as it once was."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Templates only. You can't place your images where you want them."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is a Best App to Photo Edit, But can't download new Fonts & Effects"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"New update screwed cropping. I've been using this app for years and have really enjoyed it. However, there must have been some recent update or something because it's impossible to crop images anymore and retain any quality, especially if there is text in the image. The quality will be extremely, extremely poor and illegible. If there is any way to fix this, please let me know. Otherwise I am unable to use it to crop images/text images anymore. Also I've tried reinstalling and changing settings"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"TOBORROCHI"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app needs to spend money to open this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now it won't let me use it on my phone unless I have internet. Very frustrating."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Does what you wanted to do but when you save it saves in a very poor quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save anything. I will cancel if this isn't fixed. (Had it for years with no issue. Shame)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid a lot of features here but now I could this editor app became MONEY MAKING. Too many bugs and errors then they would encourage you to uninstall then reinstall again. 💰 making, right? 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best application!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my favourite photo editing app for years now, I used to edit large photos, but now for some reason the save resolution limit was reduced to 1080p, it won't let me save my photos at their original size, it's now useless for me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid subscription now doesn't work since update wants me to buy again"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"There's bugs. Can't edit texts"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It can't run for longer than a minute, and on the rare occasion it can, ads are everywhere"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app but its online"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I do enjoy using this App...although i really wish you would add ALOT more stickers. The ones you have ...i use maybe 3 pages out of the several you have?...you really need to add ALOT more...better flowers emojiis...fall...idk just add more please!...the stickers you have kinda suck. But other than that...i like this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great Application heal option is so good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Disappointed that the latest update limit the resolution to a 90s monitor screen size"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"You really need to make the doodle feature more professional and easier to use."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It works again after reinstalling! Thanks guys!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was once my favorite app to edit, now the buttons randomly stop working and it freezes each mobile device i try it on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i want it to have screan shots like make the app screan shot what you want but the app is good!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Loved it. Best till date."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I shouldn't need wifi to use an photo editor app. Requiring wifi to show me ads is not a good excuse. Facemoji Keyboard. Crowd City. Lightx. They all have ads yet i don't need wifi for them. I refuse to subscribe to a plan for an app I can easily replace. And I'm a college student who doesn't have much to my name."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once you re save the image, it becomes pixelated and blurry. ☆☆☆☆☆☆REPLY FROM SUPPORT:☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ No I dont think it's the same bug your responding to in every single bad review you get. It is simple. The picture goes in pretty and comes out blurry. You know if you fixed it & offered a donation option, your millions of users would generate WAY more cash flow then by doin it this way."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Need to pay for offline use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wanna kill an app???? Default to loud adverts... very disappointed former premium user happy to tolerate adverts but not keen on loud adverts when MUTE won't default."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Edit: After 5 years, 5-4⭐. No longer Autodesk. Obnoxiously obtrusive ads everywhere! Every thing you do is followed by a long full-screen ad! I've reverted to an older, more tolerable version. // Original Review: Haven't found a close competition for Pixlr on Android market yet. It's highly functional and offers numerous photo editing tools. The best thing about it is that everything has no price tag attached to it and there are no silly intrusive ads. I hope they will forever keep it that way."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wew"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I've just reinstalled pixlr and I'm happy to say that the problem with the maximum resolution has been resolved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Old version is good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Size foto menjadi turun setelah di save"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"To be fair, the developer seems to have quickly fixed the recent issue regarding size and saving and it's back to being my favourite photo editor. Cheers!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Changed to put in ads is annoying but not allowing to have offline access without paying for a subscription is stupid."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"noice..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love the app & use it all the time BUT it Never let's me use stickers! I click on a sticker, it prompts me to enroll for a year for $7.99, I click prompt to opt in, it loads a price of $11.99 per year instead. Ewkay, I click my payment button anyway and get an error code, then another that says you already own this. THEN WHY DOES IT NOT LET ME USE THEM AND PROMPTS ME TO PAY WHEN I TRY TO USE THEM IF I ALREADY OWN IT???? 😑 This has happened SO many times."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why in the world would I PAY for an app that doesn't have a back button?! Srsly! You have some neat features but not having a back button is the worst thing ever when you're editing! If I make a wrong swipe then I have to use the erase too when other apps simply have a back button! Also your adjustments are way to sensitive! Just a little tiny slide to the left or right for saturation completely wipes the color out or amps it up to 100,000 degrees! Fix your app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When i adding text it will blank automatic . Update this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was best photo editor ever. Simple and powerful. But recently save resolution limit was dramatically reduced to 1080. Sad to say it, but I have to move to another photo editor without such resolution limitations."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Seems like a good app but am unable to save anything."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After using this app successfully for over a year, it's now giving me an error when I try to download edited pictures. If this isn't fixed I will find another app, as I use this feature several times per week. Here's the message- ""Cannot create the save file. Please make sure there is free storage space and the path is available to be written to. Operation not permitted"". This message continues even after I've taken all privacy restrictions away. There's plenty of storage on my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I dont know what you did, but sort it out. After many years of using the app with absolutely no problems or complications, now we can't save any pictures anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It used to allow me to directly text an edited photo but now I have to save then send. ""More"" only allows me to email. The extra steps are annoying"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great stuff"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Something went wrong with this app after a several years, It used to be my number one of photo editing apps, now they asking us too much. Bug n crash etc. Too bad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you for best app 🙏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a great photo editing app. I wish they made one like this for video editing. Good app i recomend it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UPDATE! To anyone having same issue,remove & reinstall app. After doing this changed what,must of been an update glitch. Collage/photo save quality in general,seems to be restored. Hope this helps. :) **Past update** Not happy! Hope it gets fixed. Recent update messed,with save quality. When doing a collage for years,if was 6 pics it was between 25 to 40 MB. Now it's around 5 MB,really compressed the images. Went from a pic size of thousands to around,1440 even PNG over JPG doesn't help."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No layers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The quality of 200x700 is bad. I try to edit, but you gave me 200x700 of saving the size of the picture. That'a not my favorite."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Update as of 2020: won't even save images! What's with all the bugs and ads lately? ---- The best! Quick to learn interface, tons of options. Hope they get more photo layering or selective area color editing options in the future. And occasionally it acts up and saves an image different than what's on your screen if you use the ""remove spots"" tool, a bug I hope they fix soon. Otherwise, great filters and retouching, saves in full resolution or smaller if you choose."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"How stupid and sad that you put in time editing the photo and then the app freezes on export.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"There should be more choices"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"PLEASE add an undo button. I beg you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"i like this app , wonderful use this app,but i like 3 star"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Cannot download font, it always says, ""Please check network connection and available storage space"", my device running with android lollipop 5.0.2 with 2gb of free space, using fine wifi connection. Any solution?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"🌻Good App! I use this on my Computer! To edit lion king photos! But 4 stars because sometimes it doesnt save my work👓when i |×| out. :( but good app :) 🌻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 maha bakwaas editor's chice soch 🧠🧠 samajh kar dena chahiye 😠😠😠😠😡😡😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Better software for the edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now it spams like 4 ads at a time and won't let you use offline. Edit: I literally thought it could not get worse but it did. Now for some reason when I imported photos it down scales their quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you, for the update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Before the recent update, once you made an edit on your photo and you go to save it, you can choose the size and quality you want to save your picture. So you can make a small picture become large with detailed quality. But since the recent update, you can only save a picture up to the same size of the picture you're editing. If you can bring back the original feature, I'll be glad to give this a 5 star rating."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow 😀 A very very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for over 7 yrs sad to see that they put a cap on image size just recently. I will be uninstalling for a better app now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Changes from the latest update mean you can't use the app offline without subscribing. Its also full of ads. Very disappointing as it used to be extremely good. Will uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is best for pics..Really this is amazing app for edit pics"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It was great until the last update. The collages resolution is too less now... not even 720p, please revert this change.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After several years of this app being my go to for editing I now can't save any pictures unless I disable all my protections against data theft by ads. I would pay a flat price for a photo editor that I like but I refuse to pay a subscription just to remove ads so I can do a basic function as saving a file I've edited. Many people seem to be deleting for the same reason. I guess your greed will be your apps undoing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Still won't edit in Landscape, so not used much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my ""go to"" app for simple photo editing. I've been using it for years. I loved it. But I WILL NOT SUBSCRIBE TO USE IT! I would be ok with a one time fee. But not a subscription. I will be removing this from my app drawer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love it but uninstalling now - for no reason I can find, the save image after modifying it in Pixlr has shrunk its maximum to about 800 x 600 pixels, no way to adjust it, no reason for the change from 4000 pixel dimensons before"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my fav editing app and now suddenly I can't save pictures from it after the update. What's wrong with this ??"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hated this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I re-downloaded the app coz the file size got smaller, I thought it would fix it, BUT NO, NOW I CAN'T SAVE PICS NO MORE UGH PLS FIX THIS i have a screenshot of the error but cant post it here either"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After update its not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thanks for fixing crop issue. Please provide option for using app without internet connection without subscription. hey Devs what's ""app"" :-D hey could you add Fibonacci crop to crop tool? that would be AWESOME! cheers"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good and best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Most important application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After having happily given Pixlr 5 stars for years, I've ""downgraded"" from 5 stars to 1 as consecutive ""updates"" to this app have only served to remove or limit prior functionality and features, then put them behind a subscription pay wall. They negate to mention the app now requires an always on connection to do anything, so you can't edit anywhere you've no connection...unless you are willing to pay a monthly fee, which it's not worth it for casual use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent💗👌 liken with Photoshop👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Almost very good app but only 1 issue..... Maximum quality pictures not save....!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not work offline"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"ஏனையவை"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Unique"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just overall disappointed with how this app has changed. It used to be a wonderful, simple photo editor. My go-to. But they keep messing with it and adding ads (unless you pay per month. I don't mind buying a good app, but I'm not doing a subscription), and now you have to be connected to the Internet to even use it? I'm out. And I'm so sad, because it used to be a great app. ""Used to be""... Edit in response to the developer: I am willing to buy an app. I'm NOT doing a subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE APP! Used to be able to use this app with my firewall but not anymore. Uninstalled!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. The filters and featurss are pretty cool plus it's really easy to use. If you can, I would suggest you use the web version instead because it has more features, can take bigger files, and has more hidden ads. If you can't though, Pixlr mobile still does the trick just fine."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"DO NOT!!!! I REPEAT, DO NOT TAKE THE FREE TRIAL, IT'S NOT SUCH A GREAT APP AND THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ruined app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Like the app but just lately when I have finished editing a photo.... an ad pops up right in the middle of saving it . Frustrating"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are horrible! Deleting this app after 2 years."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app was my favorite photo editing app. Now it forces me to have internet connection in order to edit the photos... Disappointed ☹️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I loved pixlr and using it for many years but recently I got a new phone that pixlr won't work properly. Can't save pictures after I spent a lot of time editing. If I can't save pictures then it's useless Saving problem solved but New update is terrible, sadly I must looking for similar app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"the photos are saving with terrible quality and size, much lower than the original"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I always use this app above all others on my computor/ph. . across the board, it consistantly satisfies most of my ""image"" (post-work) requirements. Recommended ""tool"" to have in your App. arsenal."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Fine. 👌🌷"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I always use this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"When apps that were once *free* go to cheesy ads and institute *pay to play* I'm pretty much done bc quality usually follows. (My previous review for this app was from about 5 years and 2 phones ago. After reading these later reviews, this one *def* comes off my ""wish list"") I suggest checking not only ""app developer"" info, but reviews and especially developer *responses to reviews* or LACK thereof when considering a download to the mini PC that's sitting in the palm of your hand. -js"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Too many ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like this app and I use it for beautiful editing pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fish"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Supar"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good application for small editings on phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"good app but always crash and it's starting to piss me off"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Just noticed that several of the double exposure options have been removed. How did this happen?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app ever!😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app, love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Greatest app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazingg photo designer"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I feel sorry that the developers of Pixlr had to do this. In the world of crappy editing softwares with stupid ads, Pixlr was a savior for me. I've used it for 5 years, shared it with all my friends. And now, I am asked to buy premium or I can't use the app offline. Sad to see Pixlr join the crappy editing softwares. A year ago I would've given it more than 5 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"you should consider adding more flitters and options"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for 6 years now. I remember i found it when i got my first smartphone. Have been preferring it ever since. But now it have ads, doesn't work offline, heck, I can't even make collages. Been loading images for half an hour. I know devs need money too. Students can't afford ₹1000 per year for this. Make a one time payment option and everyone will buy it, since all your users are loyal to you. And fix the app. Why is it taking forever to load images for collage?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"😂😂😂 worst"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gud and the best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Suck, to many advertisements lately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good App for adding photos and organizing the size too but need more clearly after adding"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"this app is fantastic. used it for years. a landscape mode needs to be includrd because with a tiny mobile screen (tiny even on a large phone) you need all the pixels you can get to really see crisp detail. adding that would be a blessing. thanks for the work you guys do."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is my favourite go fast download guys his app is to good 😋😍😍😘😘😘😘😘"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Every app on here has become about money & greed. Yes, developers need to live, too, but the greed has overtaken the usefulness of aps. Devrlopers use noisy, data robbing video ads that are so frequent as to make the app useless when trying to edit. Concentration is needed to edit and you can't when there are constant, excessive interruptions. The interruptions are so heavy, that one can't tell if the app is worth buying ad free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I used this for more than 2 years now. And since I'm a free user, the ads was getting annoying keeping me out of focus from my edits. I decided to find a new app. This one actually really simple and nice before the latest update year ago. Overall it's getting (( so so )) now and not that much helpful."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Eraser tool absolutely doesn't work. Worthless app. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It used to be excellent. Even the most recent update did not resolve the doodle function colour problem."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Allows hackers to get into to files y believe y had sequired"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's really good for my fans to see on my videos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️❤️💝💝💝"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Everything is good ,,one think when I edit any photo album, like**5 minute automatically closed application why I don't know about that,, please follow this matter,, thanks all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is a very very fantastic app thax for application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Goood"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Boring 😴"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I usually use a video editor to edit my photos when I'm done I just take a screen shot but this changed it all this is why I'm giving this app five stars, thank you so much 💙🦋"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unskippable ads is an internet/ app camcer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"its gud"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Using this app from 2014 but didn't rate so far,(as they never asked me to rate) now its my turn to give them 5 stars 🤗🤗🤗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app has brought out my creative side. Easy to use with many features. My favourite feature is superimposition."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This app is fantastic. I am using it since 2015. I did not get any problem since then. But after latest update the fonts do not downloads it says ""check your internet connection or available storage space"". Please fix this problem as soon as possible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good app. Ads are fine and necessary. But those video ads are brutal."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just Why to ruin a perfect app by adding payd subscription, so disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After a few years of using these it finally quit working it's saying something about bad internet when in fact we have perfectly fine signal and now some of the pics I've edited with these app appear in black and white lost a ton of photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"First time using the app, sending copy of legal document but needed to blur out personal info. I made the edit, went to save it and BOOM 30 second ad. Stuck for 30s. Out the time and out the job contract i would have had. That'll be me, uninstalling this POS app. If you think I'm being cheap, try buying your apps before trying them out, do that for 1 year. You'll be broke and drowning in ads for useless, predatory apps. Greedy bastards never learn. Make good apps, you won't have to run scams."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"had this app forever ...my favorite app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,".great !!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great editor, but the internet requirement sucks. I live in an area where there is no internet and also none nearby. I remember previously that it did not need internet but since some update it seems to do. Also it would be great if the invert colour effect was available with the app instead of having to download it. Resetting the app deletes the downloaded packs, including the one with the invert colours effect."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ultimate bait and switch... I have used this app for years without issue. It was very functional, robust, and a pleasure to use. I had recommended it to friends and even used it at work (to solve a crisis), much to the joy of my boss. Today when opening the app, some roadblock message appears about subscriptions or 'turning on my internet'. What?! My internet is always on. But aparently my friend's wifi network has been set to block ads, not my phone. App is worthless now... VERY UNHAPPY."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good. Better than more rating apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Lame"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr has been working great until recently. When i go to save my work it rolls an ad and then closes the ap to the pixlr home screen deleting sometimes hours of work. I am probably deleting this app forever. Ive had to redo my work too many times at this point."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Everything is fine but as soon as i minimize my work for a moment, it disappears and i need to start from the beginning and it's too frustrating. Please try to resolve this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app for quick edits!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As many I'm user for aaaages now I just noticed offline mode for cash...... You just ruined everything clap for yourself.. I was loyal I have to say now with next fail ""Error downloading ***** pack"" I download better app.. Doesn't matter if I'm on mobile data (with or without VPN) or WiFi (with or without VPN) no more chance ""for me"" to download more then what's in basics.. Maybe it's for cash as well so I have to say good bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app with some great filters & fantastic frames."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and I love it, but now they have totally ruined this great app with distubing, invasive and revolting ads that make this app completely unusable. After so many years, i'm uninstalling this once great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"How to clear picture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for at least 2 years now and it is my go to for picture editing. For those complaining: no ads = no pixlr. It is a simple equation. Pay the $2/mth and be happy you can use the app anywhere. I took off one star because the app does not work in a landscape orientation. Most images I edit are landscape and look tiny, especially when cropping. Also, as my phone gets larger it is much more comfortable to use ""sideways."" Is this a feature that can be added in the future?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I can't choose the size of fonts when inserting text. I used the web based program instead and that works fine and has more controls."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have using this since a long time but there is problem in this software that something it stuck on loading when i select the pictures and share through pixlr and it did not get resolve until you restart your phone.in busy work i have to again.gonna uninstall in few days if same will happen"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exceptional UI and easy to use features. Works great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be my favorite editing app, but suddenly all the photos I touch up leave a bluish-green mark wherever I tap when I use the ""heal"" tool."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It a pretty good app. I did some nice pics using it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved it in 2015, now, not at all. All the cool things are gone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is so much fun. If you want to be creative with your photographs, this is the perfect app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A wonderful tool shed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was good until it started asking for internet connection for ads purpose and for using basic features on paid basis.i had this app from the very beginning it's phase.now I think I need to let it go. I used this app for more than 10 yrs on my phone. I recommend this app to everyone before Snapseed came.now it seems they are behind Money than customers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best photo editor period."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WHY AM I SEEING ADS"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lame subscription model. Sorry folks, but your software is now good enough for what you want to charge. Uninstalled and good bye..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It has been a great app for many years till recently when I had to uninstall it coz new payment system that was added, the app is now useless to me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage app now that it requires CONSTANT internet access! Very frustrating to be constantly harassed by this app when I lose connection for one second. Looking for a replacement asap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't use offline without a subscription anymore! I see a different company owns Pixlr now too. What a bummer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for a couple years. Love it!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This had been my daily photo editor until the latest update, which added a subscription thing. I can no longer use this app in offline mode, as I don't live in a 1st world country having good ""internet connection"". It was a good app, but sad to see their decisions going this direction."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No more fun because of paid version"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App not working properly in one plus 8 T"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have this program for five years. It has never been like this.This program is online. That means I must be connected to the Internet for it to work. Sometimes some parts of it do not work properly. If I still have this program, it is only because I hope all these problems will be solved in the new update:("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Always stuck at 33% when I want to save it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't use the app offline any more. I'm not online all the time and this app is now useless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was great before. I understand that you need to add ads for this application to maintain but unable to use the app if offline? It sucks. The ad makes the app unresponsive. Tools became limited. I guess I need to find a different app that is much better than this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the few apps that works flawlessly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Double exposure not working after latest update in Android 10."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There's now a pop-up ad about the subscription that is NOT dismissable in any way. I paid for ad-free long ago and restored the purchase, but i think this is a bug. The app is unusable now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This game is amazing in my opinion, I guess it's just because I'm weird & misunderstood"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"F@#k this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used to love this. now it's online only, telemetry, pay-for-everything trash like the rest of the current state of android. terrible. seems i didn't buy a new phone, i paid for an ad-platform. greed is not a good quality. shame on you. you are all making the world worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste of time and money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfectly good though I can't now use it offline as I used to!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good but less option to edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's good pretty basic.You have to pay extra to get all the good stuff."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now it's required internet connection, what's that for? And ads keep popping up when I saved a picture."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No copy, paste, layers. Awful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr...! I'm using this app since 2010 or maybe 2012, it's completely ad free, so what about know...? It's useless for me and uninstall it because fo your ads. I thought you are making some new features and more perfect this app but you are making this app useless. Now I'm using Snapseed from Google and Adobe photo express. Happy with the grate results. So bye bye Pixlr. uninstal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app its my always go to pic editor. No matter what phone i have this app is in it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo app by non"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Let's be honest: it's NOT free, certain features require you to pay. Plus lately the app does not see my latest photos in my Gallery...really ???!!! Plus today every time I saved a modified photo and then went into my gallery, the saved photo had 2 black rectangles on it like it was censoring something."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage. Used to be a great app (that's why it has high rating) but new owners plagued it with adds. Don't install."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mantab"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads are extremely invasive"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now my text always blurs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and it still blurs my text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best + n SIMPLY the Best."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cant even download it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Supar mast"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Earlier it's used to work just fine but now while eidtinf whether I am writing or overlaying the things get blurred and ruin the overall quality, I thought I didn't update or something.. But it is completely updates, even the colours seem to not be working properly for text, the pverlayed pictures get blurred if their are letters on them. It's really bad. Can't use it to for even basic things."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"LOVE! Use it daily"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hollywood loves me now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love that but i have no money to buy your all of sticker"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unstable. Crashes while saving. Pathetic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool app..used it before, and still using it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"it was free.. then bammmm.... you need monthly subscription to use it... bye pixlr... uninstalled it already..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads mid edit are horrible"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app is good but so many bug and glitch"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be one of my favourite apps, however since the long gaming adverts began interrupting when saving my changes,I am strongly considering uninstalling it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app and many different versions of it for the last maybe 6-8 years and has been my one and only tool for editing pictures and creating art. I know this app in and out. And now out of nowhere I have to pay? To use it OFFLINE?? Who's brilliant idea was that?! So now the app is basically useless because it won't let me do anything unless I subscribe to a plan and just closes by itself. Thanks a lot, Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Complete garbage. Could even draw over a picture, all it does is zoom in and out. ""Doodle"" over the image, nothing happens."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You removed office mode.... worst app now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Kindly add more fonts and stickers to blend in.., also make them customizable for editing their font color and shape & size.., rest all good.., and also add more moody tunes for photo filters... Keep up the good work.... Eagerly waiting for more updations and collections."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالیه"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've loved this Application for years. Love the art and the special effects. It does so many incredible things. Things that no other Application does. At least not the ones I've seen. Wonderful Job The only issue that causes me upset. Is the constant reminder for internet access. Pixlr never asked for this before. Tell me why I've very curious😉😉"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Oo come on guys!!... 1to 2 edit a Time the app doesn't allow me to save my images properly sometimes it gives me the option to choose PGN or jpg yes I know I have to click custom but as soon as I press done after editing a image it just closes the only way I could actually get to exporting part is unless I closed the whole thing restart all over again guys this is too many glitches for paying users! It wasnt like this before... or tune its programing, very very stressful!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sorry I'm living this app now... It use to be fun... I don't see the need of having it anymore... Do you know the cost of data in one thing that hasn't changed a bit in so many years... Sorry"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The app is hands down worth 5 stars. However, I quit using it a couple months ago when it wouldnt let me work offline. Bring that back please!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Android 10 Now its saying all the time that internet is offline when it isn't. What dimwitted developer would make an app that has to be a paid full version to use OFFLINE. RETARDED AS HELL"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why the hell does it need internet to work? Does it send some data or metadata? One star and uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app for editing 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad bad bad very much bad it's updated version asking for in purchase very much disappointed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They changed it to online only use now. Not worth it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Now that is has text this app is years ahead of most paid apps. Definitely a great application!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's very good app. But nowadays this app asking for money.. why..???"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why do you need network connection to use the app now? Uninstalling it now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cnt p'form any action widout in'net %("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until they added FULL SCREEN UNSKIPPABLE ADS - and now my edits aren't saving correctly either. Amazing how quickly you can tank an app with just a few bad choices."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Cannot use it offline ..keeps giving command to shift online and even if my internet is on it doesn't shift to online mode"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very worst , 3 month £729 rupees , over rate 😠😠😠😠😠"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice 😀"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is just wow for me.. I am using this app from 4 years and I don't have any complaint about this one . It's effects are natural....I love it❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be the best free photo editing app, now you have to pay to use it. Don't recommend downloading it or subscribing, it's a waste of money. Use a different app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless... Maybe that has to do with the android version but Im having nothig but trouble. Switching to something else"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app like this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"100 supper aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with ""make sure you have a good network connection."" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you for discountt"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was the coolest ap eveeeeer. Now it glitches way too much. Can't even shrink the letter size. Dude I loved this ap. Crazy 4 years...now we have to break up."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It now requires a subscription, or internet access? FOH. I've been using this app for over 5 years. This will be my last time. Losers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Soo nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What's up with the new update. Are you guys stupid or what it's already connected to the internet but it still wants me to connect to the internet via wifi why what's wrong with my mobile data huh????used to love this app sadly I have to uninstall it now .....🤬🤬"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love it. Now getting ads here in there. No big deal but no way and app work good for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, ""Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model."" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A great photo editing tool a easy to use app.!!! I was skeptical at first butt now this is the only photo editing app/too i fu*k with!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"App is very nice and working very well. Like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I paid for the ad-free subscription but it's still showing me ads as of the latest update!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What a shame! I've been using this for ages as it's a really good piece of kit - now all l get is 'pay to subscribe' to continue. I can't even use it offline even though I'm connected to a very stable Internet connection at home. Nah, I'm out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I like this app she is good for memer's and a lot of thing but for me you shold make a nouther app for making video's 😇"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😠😠😠😠"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice 🤩👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I read from the internet that this apps can make pixelated pictures or text clear unfortunately this apps can't do the task."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"when I lost my internet connections, losting my all work😡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Thank you Pixlr, I am deleting this App after donkeys year. Regretting for not trying other apps.. but thanks now is the time to give opportunity to new app builders. All the best guys.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It seems like you decided that if i don't purchase ...i can't use the app!!!! Seriously ? Is this a kind of scam or a fraud or what ? I downloaded a free app ...i don't the extra features ...for God sake do you think i would buy by being blackmailed . If this is not fixed ...i'll just uninstall dear."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WAS my favorite editing app on my phone. Glitchy now. Too many ads now and they are making the app unusable. Just shuts down completely. The images on screen literally vibrate if I'm not on WiFi, app just freezes. Time to find a new one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Web version is alot better. This is like the autistic version of pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for many, many years to edit my photos. It had great filters and was by far the best free photo editing app out there. Now they want to gouge us for crazy cash subscription?! Screw that! Way to ruin a really good thing. Very, VERY disappointed. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Terbaik"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Tem muitas funções, mas a melhor sem dúvidas é o modo retrato! Muitas funções estão limitadas e precisa pagar, mas atende minhas necessidades, pois uso para colocar o modo retrato em minhas fotos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very good app, enjoy using."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GReat"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice & Usefull App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Goog ejoy it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"At first it worked great.. Didn't even mind the ads.. Now it doesn't work at all! I can't do anything it just force closes. This is my first review of any app... I'm highly disappointed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After update, can't even use offline.... So, uninstalled and downloaded a previous version 😜"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best for basic editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for a long time and it's GREAT. May need to update as there may be a bug shutting the app down once in awhile but that just recently. I also use free advanced Pixlr on PC for my professional needs. Best for sure."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Says free photo editor then charged $1.99/month"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Like others, I've been using this app for years and now all of a sudden they want you to pay for an exorbitant subscription (there's better editors if I'm going to pay, btw). They say you can continue to use it for free if you're connected to the internet (presumably so they can generate revenue through ads), but it's glitchy because it says you need to connect to the internet even when you're already connected. If you go back, it goes back to the home screen. Guess all good things must come to an end."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stopped working even though I enabled internet for online-based use as was demanded. Very disappointing..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is cool man"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I accidentally deleted the old version from my phone and my phone's software havent been able to update so I cant download the new version anymore but this app is really great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love it, the ads ruined it. It's a shame developers have to be greedy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"NIce"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app, now the pop up ads make it virtually unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its notify me daily for subscription. If not stoped, will delete permanantly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❣️❣️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Using this app for a long time, very useful and best app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I hate that you need data or wifi. You didn't have to before."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Since the very start it's been a faithful tool for quick and concise edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its a really good app I use it when I need a quick crop of a photo or a screenshot honestly 10/10 but make sure to keep up with the updates"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good and great for editing but recent app demands payment and kind of online."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Like every online app, Pixlr has access to our personal informaton, and can sell it for a fortune (i.e. Facebook is valued over $120 billion). Yet, Pixlr wants us to pay monthly or a one time, large, annual fee. Sorry Pixlr, Bob Dylan was wrong, ""you can [NOT] have your cake and eat it, too."" It was a good app while it lasted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very handy. I use this for all my photos..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's the best photo editing app iv I've ever used in my life. 📸📷😁😎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great for trimming screenshots. Check your data settings if it insists on trying to access wifi."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love using this to edit my photos for myself and photos for my friends it's fun to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cute"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo editor I've ever stumbled across and I've tried hundreds of other photo apps. Such a fantastic app with the freebies alone, been using Pixlr for yrs. Now I'm curious enough to purchase all its features."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"cant use it offline without subsciption so i have uninstalled it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app since 2014, it used to work perfectly and be my go-to app for photo editing and collages now it takes forever to load a picture I'm trying to edit. Hopefully it's a bug that can easily be fixed otherwise I'll have to go in search of a new go-to editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is the best photo editing app I have tried; Update: mybapp is showing me ads even though I've paid"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's my go to for editing pics on my phone. Would like a little more control with heal, blur and Doodle feature."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I'm using this app from 2013. I didn't face any difficulties bt now I'm getting irritate because its take too much time to save sometimes it didn't and again I have to start from starting."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It's been a great App for me. I have slowly started to use it as my go to photo editing app. I don't know what happened but in the middle of some complex editing, my WiFi went out because of a power outage, and I lost my work just like that. It demanded that I register/subscribe for an offline version to continue (well, I didn't have WiFi in the first place to register at that moment). That was very uncool. My edited image should have been left alone, I could have even saved it via screenshot."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I use this app for school for photography. It helps me edit photos but it does get quite boring after you use it for two hours straight 😂 good app anyway"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app but online app offline is better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"To make up for my one star review. Still usable as free version, though pop up ad about paid version was confusing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No longer free"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"v good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Superbbbbbb App for Photos editing .. .."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Faltu app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Went from a 5 to a 1. Too greddy with 30 sec ads and stuffed the app. Congrats, I'm out, along with anyone else who knows this app isn't worth the ad free subscription money your asking."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't add a picture in picture"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good, Advance,...tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but they've gone & added ads that overlay the app, causing it to lag & crash every time you try to use fonts, save, or do much of anything else. - Suuuper unfortunate."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"i think you should change your name from pixlr - free photo editor to pixlr - paid photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love how you can edit eny picture I have alot of nice ecchi anime images. this app is the best in my opinion thanks Google play much respect fam."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for the longest time, but now they've added ads. Went to see if there was a pro version I could maybe just pay $5 for and be rid of the ads- nope, you gotta buy a monthly or yearly subscription. Because of this, I'm going to delete this app and take my money elsewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"With the most recent update I am now seeing ads even though I previously paid to have them removed. Tried to restore purchase and it didn't help. This needs to be fixed quickly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was working great and it's supposed to be free but now it wants me to pay and won't let me edit pictures any more. If its not free I'm gonna uninstall it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amaging app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr just went forced subscription. No longer free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app... but now you have to subscribe AND PAY?! I don't think so!!! Time to find a new app unfortunately...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing application for pics editing, if increas of words and font size display aded to this app will become fantastic for users n lovers of pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uuuum what happened. I used to love using this app now its saying I can't use it without a monthly subscription?? What happened to the free version, I'll even take ads. But now when I got in to edit a photo it tells me to subscribe and I cant click out of it. I try clicking go online but im already connected to internet so whats the issue."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Pakistan abbottabad PMA cintr love😍🔥"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Editing my 5 star review (2015) to 1 star (2020). Needing internet connectivity to edit photos seems sketchy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst and useless app ....please remove from playstore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible app for one reason: I can now only use it if I'm on WiFi, no ""offline"" use, even though I have my data connection, unless I pay for premium. Screw you, Pixlr team, with your money grubbing business practices."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"😭😭😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was very helpful. But now ad are disturbing & they are asking money for further use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Blocked offline usage with a paywall"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app since 4-5 years, and it has always been my top choice for editing. Love it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Using this app for almost 7 years now. It used to be a lot better. Now just a lot many ads, no offline access to the app and microtranscation. You guys have really stooped low"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good and easy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and now all of a sudden I need to subscribe and pay to use the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Made in china"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Im delusional"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I wish the filter were better and improved. They are very dull."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been a happy user for YEARS and now can no longer use the app because it says I have to subscribe and PAY to use it offline. The pop up in the app says if you are connected to the internet it will be free but so far it doesnt work for me. I'm always connected to the internet but the pop up keeps preventing me from using the app in any way."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Forcibly telling to subscribe"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for probably the better half of 6-7 years, and I've never had an issue, till now. Now I can't do ANYTHING with out it lagging out and crashing the app. I have a galaxy note 9 and all my other apps work just fine. It really is a shame because I've loved this app for years. Please fix it so I can keep using it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Pros: SOOOO VERSATILE! Cons: Sometimes the quality glitches when saving photos/text. A lot of the overlays/stickers aren't free. Double exposures don't autoplace in the center of the original photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"We used to be able to edit pictures without internet connection and now I need to subscribe just to do it??? Why?????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Excellent app until last update when ads and some kind of subscription? screwed the whole thing up. Uninstalled after years of happy usage. Congrats 123RF!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Recent changes with subscription demands /adds kill this once awesome software. Will delete it now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be worth 4/5 stars but now they've gone an added ads before you can save the edited picture and the ads sometimes crash the app, losing the picture and edits. Also force closes it's self either before being able to even select a photo, or right after. The tools have become very glitchy to use. What happened? Used to a great app. Now it's just an absolute headache. Finding a better app to use now, sadly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love it. Been using it for years now I have to pay to use it offline??? Can't even open a picture without it crashing anyway."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Change your offline mode"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded this app again after not having it for a while. The new, long, streaming ads that pop up after you click, ""Done"" to save your edit. Yeah, those need to go. I shouldn't have to wait for an ad to be done streaming in order to find out if my photo edit was saved. Also, after the ad, a little window popped up from Pixlr, saying that it was unable to save my edit/updated image I just created. And then it exited the app without my permission. After all the time/effort I wasted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Poor Pixlr... I been using this app for several years, one of the best mobile editing app back then. But sad to say this update is worse than we expect. The developer focused on money that will be drive by the net connection. Bye Pixlr😐"

Been through a couple versions of this always liked it. Have to remove it. I'm sure there are many people who can have their phone start playing random noise whenever. This app is still good if that's you."

However, with the new update, you're required to use internet– The main reason I enjoyed Pixlr so much was for it's accessibility, but now it's been completely demolished.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Love the app, but it does have some things that I wish it would do - maybe it does, but I haven't found out how. 1. Save project. Sometimes I have to leave the app and do something else, and I lose what I was working on if the app needs to close. 2. Meme Font or something similar to the outlined text that makes it easy to see over any image. I just paid for the subscription so I hope maybe I'll see the meme font there? We'll see. Looking forward to all the other features being unlocked. Thanks Pixlr! A work in progress but aren't they all? ;)"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for no less than 4 years now. It was my go to app for editing photos ever since my computer stopped handling Photoshop. I loved this app, and would always recommend it to people who would ask me how do I edit my photos. However, with the recent 'update', I am sorry to say that this app lost what made it special. I loved to use it on the go, in the bus, or when the electricity was out. Why does an 'offline' app even need you to be connected to the internet anyway?"

But then they started ruining picture quality, and making changes that made it harder to navigate. And now they force you to be online to use it at all. We're talking about editing my own pictures, not streaming videos or any bonus material. Get over yourselves. You broke somethin that wasn't broke. Thanks for rewarding the loyalty with pointless restrictions."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"App is good BUT, off late it has been irritating. Always asks for internet connection and does not recognise net even if there is a good data flow. + Advertisements is the latest annoyan e here"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"EDIT:new update renders the app useless. Ive been using pixlr for 5 years. Now it never recognizes my internet connection, even though I'm obviously connected by posting this. Asks me to subscribe to use offline. Guess I'll move to another program Just downloaded a bunch of other photo apps, and in the end I just missed Pixlr. Its the best one out there."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app regularly to modify photos. The only things I could ask for is an integrated background eraser option (like the Ultimate Background Eraser app) and a blurring wand/brush. I'd give 6/5 stars if I could. By far, it's the best."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app... Not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app to edit photos, edit pictures. We can crop, add overlays, add text, add borders. We can change aspect ratio of image (of course some portion may be cropped). We adjust brightness, contrast, hue etc. We can prepare collage. We can save to large or small size. Very useful app. Must have app. Some overlays are paid and not free. However free ones are just sufficient. Worth installing and trying."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Now needs internet access for INTRUSIVE ads. I don't mind paying one time for a premium app but they are asking for a subscription. NOPE. I'm now evaluating alternative apps. Edit: I'm deleting Pixlr and going to use Snapseed for now. We'll see how it goes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The performance of this app has just gone from excellent to worst... experiencing lots of issue with the app and its function please look into this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Junaid lohar"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"NOTHING CAN TOP THIS APP CHANGE MY MIND! I've used this app for YEARS to make top quality covers for books and its made the best I've ever seen."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love been using for a couple of years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Zohaib"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Buggy. Required Internet but the App failed to detect connected internet or 4G."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save photos after editting, always shows saving 50%. Waste of time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Quality everything is good but I always get problem when saving the photo or collage never gets saved so I lose all my progress that's why I'm gonna uninstall"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now it sucks with how much it hounds you with ads, constant data/wifi connection, and annual sub bs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Definitely the most user-friendly photo editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Now. The letters with colors are so blurry .There is a problem : The button key ""next of Pixlr "" is not functioning !!! .Hoping it will download very fast because I will use it for my project about our Holy Almighty Creator !!! Thank you !!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Working very slow .... And not Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Looking interesting and a lot of options to make your pictures standout. But only complaint is; this has a lot of Ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No.. Now it's not free app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unusable now due to ads. Was one of the best. All good things end I guess."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Problem while saving, as the picture gets blur"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible deleted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"World nmbr one editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This went from being my favorite app to least favorite. The ads are disruptive!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good editor.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not like its use to be why would I pay for an offline edit app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really helpful app.. I personally love it for basic editing 💙"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm using it from last 5 years and only the app that I didn't uninstalled from my phn"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Update: ADS!!! Keeps saying to connect to internet to use now, & I AM, BUT IT STILL WON'T WORK, WANTS US TO BUY. THIS USED TO BE GREAT! This REALLY NEEDS a back button on healing instead of having to erase it all. Also, need an option of being able to slide the healing tool around instead of only dotting it repeatedly. That gets tiring and takes a lot of time. More filters, frames, effects, please? Like colored, wispy smoke, grungey, ones? Some Gothic ones? Some industrial and some girly ones?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Difficult because signed on indicated I needed a code to sign on.....not sure where I was to get that...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love the so much ❤❤❤❤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I want more fonts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Simple and basic, just like me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was fine while it was free up until today. Now I can't use it at all without buying a subscription. I'll be uninstalling"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not so needed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Welp... The full screen ads break the app.. Congrats... Full screened timed ads? Really? Not only that but when the ads are done, the lower menu bar vanishes? I've used this app for years, this hurts to see.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good!!✨✨"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of the best to stylize photos. Now it won't let you use at all, UNLESS YOU PAY. No free version to check out and deciding if you want to go pro. Ugh, Pixlr, why did you have to ruin it??"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good until they crippled it with ads that mess up your edits."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"After update app not working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Before first photo editing it asks to download some content from the internet and asks to enable the internet even the mobile network is enabled on my phone and it is working. But it doesn't see the mobile network and wants to enable wi-fi, but I'm not able to connect to any wi-fi networks now. It's a shame! I just can't use this app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to love this editor but now it just feels like a cash grab. Making us pay to use the editor offline now seriously? Im on the go alot in places that don't have wifi I can connect to so this is very annoying, especially since I always used to be able to use pixlr offline theres barely any features that need to use the internet. Disappointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The good app pixel 👈✔✔✔✔✔👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good condition"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"After big issues, I'm pleased to say that they seem to have fixed them. Why 4 stars I hear you say... ""Why 4 stars?"" I'll tell you. For some reason it takes ages to save an image. I can do a collage in roughly the same time it takes to save it... At least it's saving now though. Background removal/replacement would be good if that can be included soon"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Haven't used it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Don't deserve 5 stars anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be reliable. Now It crashes when uploading pics. Useless. Any suggestions?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to use this app offline. Seems arrogant to demand customers sign in. I don't like that the app is downloading every time I use it either. Will find something less demanding of customers and more appreciative of their patronage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest update ruined it. Full of glitches now. Just shuts down photo editing while adding text."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Lots of filters, frame options and editing tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app was my favorite of all time but now I m unable to download any package or features....that's why only 2 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best editing apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nic"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The fall of a great app! Next level greed from the developers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app and used it for years. Intrusive adds, can't use it offline anymore and why? Because greed took over the creator. If there was one flat rate purchase instead of a dumb subscription, sure I'd probably get it but I'm not about subscription based apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't see the need to have net access to edit pics once in a while. It was good as it was before."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was such a good app. Now you have to pay for it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app. BUT it leaves so much on my tablet I have to clean it (2270 just from one of the features) I have to clean it after every time I use it and I use it every day. But great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this photo editor for years and it used to be a lot better - then they screwed it up with way too many ads, and of course, like many companies inevitably do, they made some of the app features paid. It's also become significantly slower and buggier, has crashed on me multiple times and lags like all hell. I'm actually really annoyed that a once great app has gone so down hill. Fix it up, guys, whatever you're doing recently sucks BIG TIME compared to what your app used to be."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This WAS an excellent photo editor app. Easy to use, easy to navigate. I loved it. But in August 2020 they changed how the ads work on the site. You have to click through countless ads to get anything done. And they started charging fees to use their functions. I deleted the app because the ads make it unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is a fantastic app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for years, now all of a sudden I have to pay a sub to use it??? Disappointed to say the least and now deleted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's irritating. Many times collage image doesn't get save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It seems that anything I do that's got anything to do with a pixel phone is a pain in the butt."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It is so useless now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stop saying free app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It cannot record videos, it can only take photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👌🏻"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow, great way to ruin a perfectly fine app! Thank you!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ad at mid of usage really sucks. Also, the app is stammering after your Ad get ends. So I've uninstalled Pixlr. Cheers!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was great until the app started hijacking my gallery and loading over 2100 artsy thumbnails to it EVERY TIME I edited a photo. I'd go through and delete allllll those art thumbnails...and the very next time I used Pixlr it would do it again. About to delete all the garbage for the 11th time, and deleting the app off my phone. Not sure what you changed, but you lost a customer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Okay that good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to use this all the time. Now it doesn't allow offline use without monthly payment. Also it won't work even with internet for some reason. I uninstalled immediately and now I'm looking for a different app. Don't waste your time with this one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What sucks about this app when an ad plays it deletes everything, it just vanishes, this has happened on multiple occasions and the fact that i love editing and design means a lot to me with my work its heart breaking every time it dissapears its a good editing app when you know how to use it but the risk of your work dissapearing is not worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dropped to one star over mutiple updatesfrom four because there is no reason given for updating. I won't update a one star pig in a poke app. Developers need to indicate What's New every time they post an update even if it is just that they found and fixed bugs or optimized code. Without an indicated change, a user has no motivation to update (or continue to use) an app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It says I'm offline so I cannot use the app because I'm not subscribed, but I am connected to a WiFi network – this really upsets me. It happens all the time, I also cannot open the app using 4G. I usually just switch to another app then. I expect to soon find a suitable alternative that does allow offline use & delete this one. I use Snapseed alongside Pixlr, but I like the filters here. Also, it seems that the image quality is reduced significantly when having edited and then saving the image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I purchased a lifetime subscription to not have ads. I come to the mobile site to realize I can't log in & have to UPGRADE TO MONTHLY to NOT have ads? WHAT??? I have to pay through Google for the premium. I HAVE the PREMIUM! This is CRAZY!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"it was best before but now its just complicated and boring"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I m going to uninstall ... Not working, I am using this from long time now pop up says purchase... I m not saying for paid Pro services but basic service also are not working ... Bye bye Pixlr😏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hello Pixlr team! I'm here to edit my previous review. I am taking 4 out of 5 stars back. Just because you failed me! Yeahh! You were great! But now your latest update 'F'd me up! Won't allow me to use your trash app in offline??? Realllyyy!!! Haa Haa Haaa! F U A Holes 😊😊😊 There're many 'great' apps here waiting for me! Bye Bye Byeeee Nitwit Team 👋 Adios"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite go-to photo editing app... Now new update is plagued ads.. I was okay with the banner ads before, but now with ads that make you wait is just too intrusive... I will be using Snapseed from now on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this app. Your heal tool works great, but could you add a ""back"" button to the heal feature that takes you one step back. If you mess something up in thr heal feature, you have to completely restart with the ""reset"" button. Replace that with a ""back"" button."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app donot download waste of time..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"""We're constantly working to improve your experience with Pixlr Express"" is NOT ""What's New"" !!!!! What are you hiding, scared to admit to ?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Can you guys give us a few more new templates? Your app is soo good please do share few.more stunning templates"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"خوب است"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Works decent but sometimes the quality on the picture stinks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I already gave review but it magically disappeared... so, it was editor of my choice but now it's uninstaled. Shame on you for destroying such a good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wont let you edit photos without wifi and watching ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Previous version was good to use. But now It is becoming worse. After update this is demanding for subscription. It is no longer available for free use with limitations. Now it is completely paid app. I think that I am loosing my interest with this app. A long time ago it was my favorite app. But now it is started irritating me and within a week I will shift my mind on another app for my daily work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow.....having to pay just to use it offline.....real smooth.....this use to be such a great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but these ads that pop up, usually when you're editing have ruined it. Try to edit a photo, almost ready to save and an ad appears that takes you to the play store and you lose your edits. I'm actively searching for a way to make this ad free or a different app. I paid for the ad free version and there's still a banner ad!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Getting better again. A fine collection of photo edit tools... Recently, Two Stars and before that Five Stars. I hope for optimized tool to make photos faster to transfer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Did not save changes. Did not actually do anything except text on photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is excellent app for phones! It's very easy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good appp...... Today i completed 1000 pics edit since 2 year... Ready to explore more options.. Best app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The website and the app bio says it's Free? But the app is forcing me to a paid subscription when i try open an image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't mind ads, Devs got to earn. But constant ads that actually stop me from saving or doing anything mean I'm deleting this and using Snapseed instead. Shame. Still a good app, just the ad experience has ruined it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"2020 review: Pixlr you were the one. The one app that I would suggest to everyone. Now I can't even save my work due to the ads glitch (or is it?) which only allows me go save after 3-4 ads. Sure, premium product ""must"" be paid but this is just sad. Product managers, choose your path and stick to it. Pixlr is dying. Farewell old friend. 2013 review: The amazing number of effects, edition and the easiest way to work your image makes this one of the best apps that I've experienced. And its free!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Plus point of this app it's show less ads Negative point= storage problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Mohit Arun the time as well as mich and joy ever seen the links for today's JYGs starting at the time I have joined by a week ago I am available e is a very much for today's JYGs starting at the time I have joined by a week ago I am available e is a very much possible that they ate the time as a week ago I am available e is a very much possible that they ate the time as well I guess what you please talk while in taking JYGs TODAY I am not working with the time as well I have joined by a week ago"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"My go-to photo editor until the last update, now it's glitching as soon as you try to save. And it won't stop trying to load ads after ads after ads after ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I made this as an official mobile editor, I made some purchases and now this? Shame!!! Uninstalling.. Zero Stars!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love to use this app it's very easy to do anything"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app used to be great now its full of ads... you want me to pay to be able to use your app if i dont have any wifi or mobile data...lame!!... don't you get paid enough with downloads... i won't ever recommend your apps again... who ever reads... don't download."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I previously loved this app but now every time I try to export an image I'm not able to do so as ads pop up right after closing the previous ad. Dissaponting."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Infinite ad loops to the point of being unusable. Another good app destroyed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app.its the greatesy when it comes to fixing any screw-ups with my photos, as well as completing any tasks as required to be completed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is now a trash. Used to work before but now I can't even save an image and ads keep on popping up!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sorry, I hv to deleted cos too many popUp ads. Bye bye!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Im actually sad im giving this app 1 star cause I've used for so much in the past. However, now it is full of ANNOYING ads and the app gets buggy. What a shame."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app was very good for photo alteration, now there are adds that immediately force open a split second after you close it and attempt to save what you have worked on. This causes you to click on the intrusive add instantly. This is a very sneaky way to for this app to get paid by advertisers, however very frustrating for the user of the app. Thumbs down to the new way of doing things."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"good once. now it deletes your progress unless you subscribe to a monthly service ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was annoying.. too much ad popping when i am about to save the edit. I can't even save it. Ads won't stop coming out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't preserve the original photo's Exif data which makes it unusable for me. Other photo editing apps preserve the original date taken so it's certainly possible. Also just seems to be getting progressively worse in general so have switched to Photoshop Express which is miles better!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless, constantly bombarded with ads in the middle of trying to save, clunky brush tools. Go somewhere else"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but now it's gotten so buggy and full of ads that it's just not worth keeping. Plus now if you're not online then it demands a subscription (which requires internet access) or it closes the image without any chance of saving the progress. I'm sad that I had to uninstall it, but it's no longer that glorious app that I used to recommend. RIP Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am confusion. Do I have to pay in order to save files? If so, it would have been nice to let me know that instead of have me searching every crevice of my Galaxy for the last hour like I did something wrong. Jesus don't like evil-doers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"If u r good in ,editing.u come to good place.this app is so good for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been the best free photo editor. Now it should remove ""free"" from it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive and obnoxious ads that continually pop up when you're trying to save an image. I'll be moving to Snapseed instead. Great shame, as this used to be a great photo app before the developers got dollar signs in their eyes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I would of paid a one off price years ago for this very handy app because it was my go-to editor, there are now way better and free photo apps available without all the hassle this brings. It's not a top photo editor so why all new money grabbing and offline BS. You have got to big for your boots. I don't use this version more than once a week used to be every day. 😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Obtrusive adverts. Can no longer use this app when out in the wilds due to needing online access at all time to ram adverts down you throat at any given moment. Use to be my goto app... Now I'll use something less obstructive and obtuse!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My go to photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As many comments before..it used to be good but now unable to use with all this pop ups and blockages"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your app went from 5 stars to 1 star overnight. Been using your app since it came out and I have to say that I am not massively disappointed in it all. The subtle advertising was fine but now it's completely ruined the experience. Can't believe I Will be uninstalling the app after nearly 10years."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tried to save a picture and received at least five ads in a row before receiving an error message, which I couldn't read because there came yet another ad. Is this for real? It used to be one of the best apps in the store."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads now spoil this software to the point it unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My original 5 Star review is still here from 5 years ago. Now I've edited it to 1 Star because of how bad the app has become. In order to save a edit, now you have to watch an Ad? Let's not forget a few times it has crashed when watching an Ad. This app was once my favorite, with the best filters and simple editing tools. Sadly it's been overrun by Ads. *Sad face*"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was fine, decent features, but now ads crash app when trying to save, so currently worthless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I really don't know what happened here. This was my first ever editing app I used and I have been using it for small projects since that one summer many years ago. But now, oh hoho, stuff hit the fan. At first, it was the extra stickers only premium members could use. Fine, stuff like that isn't new. But the new adds. I have tried to save my stuff but now I'm getting bombarded with adds, after adds. The app glitches due to the adds I keep getting, even if I skip them. It was fun to use.. WAS."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go-to, frontline image editor. Not anymore with a required paid annual subscription. 5 stars dropped to 1 star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Just awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on brand new Samsung A17. Says ""cannot create save file please make sure there is enough storage etc. Permission denied"". All permissions enabled, plenty of storage. Just another app that doesn't work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive ads. Used to be good, but now just to save a photo you have to watch an ad. Very bad business."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use. Managed to edit a photo even though most of the features have been removed for non payers, tried to save it, and ad after ad flicked across the box I needed to tick and blacked it out so I couldn't save anything. It was literally one ad per second. Couldn't do a thing with it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was the ""go to"" app for photo editing, until the recent update... it has become absolutely unusable because of the pushy adverts! They are so pushy, that once you click on the ""X"" to close an ad and select something in the app, a new advert pops up and so on and so on. This forces you to stop using it abandon whatever you were doing. Photoshop Express is much better with more options and NO adverts!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The app has great benefits but you cannot use it offline and you still need to pay if you got online 1 time and it can't add another photo to insert it to another and I'm giving this 2 stars and I'm not recommending this app. Hope you fix this problem Developer. I'm not forcing coz I can delete this anytime anywhere"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love the different filters i can use on this app, but since the new update, i am no longer a fan. Once a pleasure to use, sadly no longer the case. Trying to save an image and cancelling the exact same advert repeatedly has made me change my review from 5 to 1 star. I get that you must be put ads in, it's a business after all, but if i have to go through all that trouble for one image to save, it's simply no longer worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Update: I have no idea why but the ads for the free version are so intrusive I am not able to edit or share pictures, please fix this. One of my favorite mobile editing applications! Small but powerful, there are thousands of images you can create! Just use your imagination and explore the app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this pic editing app, but now have to subscribe to continue using it? Nahh.. better for me to use another pic editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"woww its amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app since 2013, but won't be using it anymore as most of the content which was free now requires a premium pay subscription. Uninstalling, you've lost a fan. Cash grab."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow this just got worse!...the ads! Jesus you click done ready to click save and pow ad after ad after ad! No stopping it.. Can't even click save they pop up that quick and never stop! (Trash app) go somewhere else for a photo editing app this ones sold out!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE ADS. I HAVE TO PRESS THE X ON THE AD 10X FOR IT TO LET ME GO TO THE NEXT STAGE SHOCKING 🤯"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Before it was free but now it's only for subscribers.. Plz open it for everyone..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Dear pixlr team.. Greeting s of the day i would like to inform you that app is not working in my phone anymore kindly do the needful so that i can make some videos . It will be great to help for me and i will be glad for your kind help. This is a great app i been useing this app form past 3 years. Thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Quite good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"If I want to Collage 2 pics on a A4 size paper, is it possible now? Will be a perfect app if it includes feature of converting images to PDF format."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ads open infinitely when trying to save, making the app useless. Please fix immediately as this is an app store violation."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My favorite little editor for a couple of years but pixlr has made it impossible to effectively save images without accidently clicking on an ad. So I'm uninstalling Pixlr for good. Too bad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be one of my favorite image editor app before the new update ruined it... I can use it offline.. but now.. It's a total wreck"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was amazing app now its ruined creed for money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved this app but out of nowhere they hit you with a fee so I'm uninstalling the app. If you had to pay to begin with thats fine, but if you advertised it as free don't hit us with a fee."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you , this application much help me fot make report, about donation . Hope Alloh give you are hidayah (bless)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The app is good and useful with many options. The issues I have with the app right now are. There is a bug or error that when you are exporting a collage with a big size it never finish the exporting and crash. The other issue is that you can't use the app offline. Maybe I'm wrong?."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was the beet mobile photo editor app, until the recent updates. Now it's just a greedy cash grab app that removes all your progress when IT glitches. Sucks to see it go."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be my favorite editing app for pictures for years..now the app wants you to pay...BOO!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save the files! I've tried to reinstall it, but it didn't work at all. Please fix this issue. Thanks in advance 🙏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bakwas"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just uninstalling one of my fav app... I think you had an ability to guess the user point... but not..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app and it was brilliant in helping me to post proper landscape pictures on instagram. Now whenever you want to save the photo or post to Instagram it just pops up with the same advert over and over. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I really used to love this app, but now you cannot save an image without many adds to pop on your screen. And when I say 'many' I mean it...they are at least 5-6. Such a shame!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"super trash now, used to be a really good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This is about UPDATE INFO ..not about APP PERFORMANCE ... It would really help us if you can TELL ABOUT WHAT CHANGES You are doing to Help us IMPROVE OUR EXPERIENCE rather than telling ""We are constantly improving your experience."" It is only after this I would know should I update or not .So please it's a kind request to mention"" What "" !"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ruined this app with ads that cause it to crash constantly. Fools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"NEW POP-UP ADS CANCELED SAVE Devs—The new ads during saves have lost me a lot of valuable work, interfering with both saves and returning to the project. The memory simply gives out and loses everything. I've been using this app for years which makes it extra sad for me to see it lose effectiveness as of a few days ago with the increase in ads. It is the best performing editor by far but can't save big things anymore. 4+ hours of (spiritual) work gone today. Buying ad-free but 1⭐ rating. 😒🤷"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"BRO THIS WAS MY FAVOURITE APP IN THE WORLD WHY YOU GOTTA BE LIKE THIS... Uncontrollable amount of ads, it doesn't allow me to use it offline and contains subscription now.. 0/10 i'm deleting it after years of usage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ya okay thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app . Easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free? Not anymore...uninstalled, sorry guys"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No beans no party"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I need to uninstall it, for me it's useless. I've been using this since 2013 until yesterday. It was the best editor for me. But today I hate it. Because I can no longer edit offline."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this app is a scam"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite photo editing app. Since the update I can't use my favorite filters without paying an extra fee and in order to use offline I need to subscribe. Uninstalling...heartbroken 🙁"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ruined by adverts! Can't even save it without watching an advert which won't even load properly.... So I can't save anything at all. Been using this app for years too."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be really good tool but now continuously spams advertising whilst trying to save images making it effectively unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Osm app ha .... Boht acha ha ...❤🔥"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Uses of the app are overal good. But the new pop up ads while trying to save the image are so annoying I actually abandoned my last photo edit, please fix this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I understand that advertising is one of the only ways to make money out of your app. Pixlr is amazing and i spent a lot of time using it. Ads made it completely unusable lately, ad after ad after ad. I can accept ads, but this time you crossed the line."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am highly particular about the changes I want to make to my photos. I also like the convenience of being able to do it from my phone. This app works well for that. For example, I like how in this app I can choose where to paint the increased brightness instead of being obliged to increase the brightness of the entire photo. I can also insert a sticker and erase part of it instead being obliged to put in the entire sticker. Convenience meets flexibility!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible app...used to be one my most favourite photo editing apps, now it's just awful, had to uninstall it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I even deleted lots of editing apps just to stick with this one. Yet I cant use it smoothly these days. In every action, ads will pop up. It's so annoying. I am okay witht the header ad but not the full screen ads each time I save. 😭😭😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved this. Killed by greed. I don't mind being served an ad but this app now presents endless loops of auto playing loud ads blocking you from actually using the product. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This has been my ATF photo editor for YEARS until yesterday. Not sure what exactly was ""fixed"" because now it's a huge mess. And I'm not paying to access data for a FREE APP"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Shame - just as the other reviewers say excessive pop ups and instrusive ads. Used it for years and sure I bought it as a standalone app at one stage too, with some additional downloaded effects. Not worth bothering about now, though uninstalled and replaced with an old version that isn't so bad, v3.4.29. But it will be going shortly. Like most developers, have got greedy and $$$ only motivation. Currently using a lot of Simple Mobile Tools apps, like Simple Gallery - and Google's Snapseed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app just became a cash grab and distroyed the used base"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to free, requires subscription now, don't know why it is labelled as ""free""."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be pretty good. Now I can't save and it just loops to ads instead. And honestly, the UI is clunky. Can't undo and redo anything. It's annoying and time consuming."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All good for last year untill last update.. adds keep popping up stopping you to use filters or to save the image, you closethem and next second your screen turns black again. Out of order..!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used pixlr for years with no problem. Now I can't download an image because I'm being blocked by ads. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the worse update. Saved Image quality is very low."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used Pixlr for many years, and always reccomend others to do so too. However the ads have recently became very intrusive, so much so I have to click them off upto 5 times during the saving image process. I guess it's time to try and find another photo editing app unfortunately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, was great until the last few days and now ads have made the app unusable even with basic functions. See you Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Using ths app since 5 years i love it.. but recently it is turned into payeble i think . So i coundnt use it.. plzzzzz enable ths app free"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since you offer a pay to use without ads service you've ruined this app with intrusive adds that don't allow the app to function as before, total sell out to the ad men!!!!! Well played, will be deleting app for one without ads or a few to remove them!!! Advertising is like a mafia extortion racket!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I would've of put a 5 star rating. I been using the app from the moment it came out and loved it. I even advised it to people to download it. But very recently the app kept crashing and now will not even open up! On my S6 Samsung. Which has left me feeling disappointed. Speically I think it is way better than photoshop. Further to say that the new way the advert now take over the whole screen and rarely puts the X to remove it to be able to save the photo. This will put more people off the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I pay my phone bill every month and yet this application continues to deny my use because I don't (also) have wifi. Very unfair."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best apps for editing pics so far. It has nice fonts , filters , abstract, stickers etc."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it. Add more filters and layers in Pixlr Camera app. Allow app camera to save pictures in gallery even if we press cross ( don't select) picture in camera mode for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Until issues are fixed: USE SNAPSEED! PIXLR's been my go-to mobile editor. I can turn smart phone photos into professional looking pieces of art. Hell, I've even managed to sell a photo. Now the app is next to unusable. I know 123RF needs to get paid, however the ads literally kill the app. The second an ad is closed, the menu options become invisible, making it impossible to edit a photo. Also, the app cannot be used offline unless you subscribe. Seriously?! An amazing app has just died."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save. Can't detect phone storage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Usefully aps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Zero stars now, long time user of free app, after update popup adds render it totally useless after another update had problems with intergrating with social media, still not addressed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"used it every few months for quick fixes.. now no longer usable. app locks itself with black screens (seems it tries to load ads, but ad server down) or ads. if that occurs you are trapped inside the app and cannot longer do anything. and it happens always after your first edit of your image. useless. uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why all of a sudden will it not let me use it offline? It was a great editing app before this, not anymore. Uninstalling it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After the update, you cannot use it without Internet connection. 😠😠😠😠😠😠👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stupid updates can't use it while offline Uninstall...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"used to love this app.... but constant advertising, changed layout, and inability to save images.... made me go elsewhere"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So lemme get this right, for years I could use this app to edit photos offline and in mobile data without issue. And now they've got it set that you have to pay for a subscription if you aren't connected to wifi. Just what the heck kind of predatory bullcrap is that. If you need a photo editor and don't have wifi I suggest going elsewhere. This app is no longer worth anyone's time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"uninstalling this your purely bussiness app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tatti"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your editor requir the internet mb for msking any picture editing ..thatswhy i hate this editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great app, where you could purchase extra filters, fonts etc and I did then, now it has about a minute of adds you have to watch to export... disgusting."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using for years.. Always been happy!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Terrible. I have had this app for over a year, and have never had an issue! That is until its most recent update. You now have to PAY for offline use, going against what it's called... a 'free' editor app. And you cant save anything you create as unloaded ads spam you and the imagine never downloads. Absolute trash. Uninstalling and never using again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tried to edit a photo & ad after ad just kept filling my screen when I tried to save changes, couldn't even close the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"F U! For no offline use, I've using for 5 years. I'm done. F U DEVELOPER"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It keeps crashing whenever I save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"veri naice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app sucks is all I can say I wish I could put 0 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Used to be my pic editor for years but not I don't feel like using it. The previous ui was better...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It sucks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app I'm using it before 2 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I get making money. But within 0.01 seconds of hitting ""save"", 9 Wish ads popped up in quick succession. Guess I'll need to search for a new photo editor, because this appears to be ""the new normal"" for this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app but now it's got adds that u can't get out of unless you watch the whole add and now they want u to buy it for no adds . This is the wrong time to be asking this with so many out of work"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful for editing!!! I love it so much and have been using this app for a few months now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite, now the new update is impossible. Deleting."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was a great app, but is now super glitchy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You ruined your whole career by adding the offline version, my whole effort work vanished when I turned off the data"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app just for the simplicity of it's double exposure tool, but now it seems to have fallen. Ads becoming more intrusive, a cost to use mobile data, not worth it anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm really confused I paid the $7.99 subscription on July 20 and I'm still getting ads and when I choose not to have ads it's asking me to subscribe again."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ruined - Absolute ad fest. Trying to save is interrupted by a constant stream of advertising. Real shame, as this used to be a great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be one of my FAVOURITE apps. Oh my god the ads that have appeared are absolutely awful. Taps to save ... ad Select quality, can't.... another ad, press X, select quality, another ad... press x tap save ANOTHER AD!!!!! Get this sorted Pixlr. I know you want people to buy it, but why change it????? Trying out different apps now I am DONE with Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I cant see the history brush....this update is not good....please please please give us that older version type.... it was a great app...but now?!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great app...but lately full of ads, making it useless and unworkable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Got so many adds that I couldn't even save a photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice apk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like this app is easy but thats the problem needs more tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is no longer a free app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"V good experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why cant I save an image to the same resolution as the original?Unable to save 720x1080 as the original picture is 720x1080. No other issues with this application."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Faul app...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was my most fav. editing app and i've been using this for almost 4 or 3 years and now i cant even use this app without wifi anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many goddamn adverts. I tried to save my photo and had to fight of a swarm of them and ultimately was unable to save said photo because the ads just kept coming and coming for over 10 minutes, not letting me finish saving the photo. I gave up in the end and clicked back to screenshot my photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Far too many adds on free version. Not worth buying so uninstalled"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bobo tong pixlr walang utak hahahshs"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ok so this is the most disgusting photo editing app on play store, you guys are seriously Hungary for money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👏👍👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why do I need to pay to use my own internet connection for the app ? Pixlr was my go to editing application since long but now it has turned into a absolute trash. Charging money for premium features is fine but for basic features is ridiculous. Fix it or you are loosing a loyal fan."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it is awsome and free, love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Old 5-star review: I love it, the update has made things a bit clunker I think. But the new Shadows/Highlights adjustment tool is long awaited, very happy thats here now. -New review: Totally sold out, so many ads that I thought my phone had glitched. And then I wasn't even able to save my image. I disconnected the internet to try and stop the relentless ads so I could save it, then it closed itself and lost my edit. Used this app for 4 years, now it's gone. How to destroy your brand in one move"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is now a complete rip-off. The Devs have hugely greedy. I'm uninstalling this app as soon as I finish writing this review."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ad hell. If you value your time by any means, avoid this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Forcing you to pay to even launch it. Used to love this app. Will be uninstalling it now."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I had fun with it"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Want more features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing you got to try this and I oh my God can you use this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for several years and really liked it. It was so easy to use that even I could do it and I am terrible with technology. But they decided to get greedy and now it can't be used without buying a subscription. No warning or anything. So, since they want to be so rude and greedy I will be finding a new editing app. I'm sure there are many better than this one. My advice for everybody: Don't even waste your time with this one. They had a great thing and they ruined it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Super sus"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I loved Pixlr with all my heart, and used it to edit my photos. It was wonderful. Now I can't even edit offline without paying. My disappointment is immeasurable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good for offline now you have to download everything and use internet just to edit photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"literal trash. too complicated and laggy, cant even use a fill bucket because it doesnt exist"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Three star!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Why would u want to irritate users by making it online?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use it a very long time since 2016 ...very best app for editing images...no any issue.. best application.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So horrible. After wasting so much time end result is disappointing. All image straches after u save them"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy application can work any time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this used to be my go to app for photo editing, but the program itself & the ads have gotten so bad that after many years of use, I'm uninstalling it for good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Spent hours editing a picture with a tablet and pen just to have the app reset when trying to save. Next day I went for it again thinking it was just a fluke... same thing. Used this app for years, and everything about it went downhill this year. Time to find something better."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exlent app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not going to pay to subcribe. Good bye Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Extremely dissapointing experience. Don't use it if you don't want to waste your time"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Absolute BS that it suddenly needs to be run exclusively off wifi or I have to pay for premium. I can't even use this on my mobile data. Even worse, not all of my edits are even saving in the end. I think I'll move my business to PicsArt...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This was a good app to crop and edit pictures but now im forced to get a subscription. It was nice using this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Was my favorite editing app but lately it has been force closing on me, pretty upset."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"App was great until last couple updates; now, the ads run every other photo edit...about sick of tik tock...no amount of cramming it down my throat will make me install it! 👎👎👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"goooood one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"still a good app.. perfect for any editing.. i understand that online thing and subscriptions but now the STYLIZE tab a favorite feature of mine is now missing.. where is it??"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"hmm nice but not reach my level"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Online Only!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't download in my phone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent easy to use app..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updated to subscription based only now 👎 Uninstalled. Terrible move, way too many FREE options out there to FORCE this on people. This app isn't that unique. See ya!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it easy to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Auto save feature should be there"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years and it's great. It lets you change all the settings instead of just using a filter"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Well, this went from being my favorite editor all the way down to mediocre. It'll get the job done but I hope you don't mind ads that interrupt you while you're attempting to save your creations. It gets very annoying super fast! An accidental click means you can't get out until the little timer says so. You'll have to close out the app and lose whatever you were editing. I realize this app is free and all but you don't need to resort to that! It only hurts you. Will be sad to uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"World's best app Simple and super performance"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have to pay money just to use this app without internet?. Used this app since it came out, and I think I'll go elsewhere now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazed fully"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why does a photo editing app access my location information when I'm not using it?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"why did you make it online?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The ads and other changes make me not like this app anymore and I've used it for years."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this for years and never had a problem. Then they made it terrible and expected me to pay for it after they made it worse. Great job at ruining it, y'all!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I will give her five star's because i'm memer in this app is good for mems"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was so good.. and with this recent update. They made it online only. Which is really anni.. even with a wifi.. while I edit a photo in between this premium only thing notification pops up and my whole project gets cancelled... I understand you need to earn money.. but this is not the way, u can make some features premium only, add ads, but why this stupid be online always to use... please stop it... That's why rating 1 star . Please fix this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Limiting offline use and excessive ads belittle the app features. Out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work properly anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WENT FROM FIVE STARS TO ONE. NOT PAYING FOR AN APP I CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE. HAVE USED THIS APP FOR YEARS. TOO BAD. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Long time user I love this app, it provides several choices to use for the enhancement of your photos and selfies"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My favorite app sometimes before. Now latest changes made it worsened. Shame on developers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was one of my favorite apps but with the recent changes and worse yet, minute long ads that you must watch if you want to save edits... Why bother. Nowadays there are free pic edit apps that work more robust. Ie sliding the bar shows in real time what the edit could look like. W/ Pixlr the edit appears after the slide. What's expected if you pay? Just no ads? Too bad they sold their souls. I may have paid a buck or two for canceling ads but a subscription.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Bagus"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's awesome one of my most favourite app it's really brilliant"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I have to find another app. This one used to be great, but recently when I use collages the photos save looking all stretched and distorted. When editing one photo not in a collage, the quality is blurry when I save it. Never used to be this way."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Had this app for a long time. Now i have to pay to use it or you want internet access? IM UNINSALLING IT! Goodbye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Guess the reason is obivious"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for editing photos and for creating textual contents hats off to the team☺☺☺😊😊😀😀"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Vip"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Never used"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for years now they want to charge. That's an absolute no. That's pure greed. I'll find another one but will not pay for what's been free for years. Shame on you Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best amongst all. Such a decent photo editor app. I have been using this app since 7 years. I download others use them get disappointed and delete. But this one is constant and must have for me. It works offline also. You can download free features inside like borders layouts stickers effects etc.. Also you can save pic in the desirable size. Resize feature helped me alot. Highly recommended."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This is a pretty good photo editor. I wish they would offer more technical editing but it isn't bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Had this app for years. Used to be my favorite they've ruined it. Must be online or subscribe to use now. Eff you guys"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was such a great app until you allowed the ads to be so intrusive as to render the app useless. It will not allow you to save. This WAS my go to app, but now I will have to find something else. 👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ive used Pixlr for YEARS. Your app has gone from hero to zero. Wow, what a mess. Ive lost so much work because of your offline mode prompt that executively decides to erase all prior work history and leave us with nothing. This was something I reccomended to friends but no longer. I'm moving to an app that values my time and paying them for their services. I would never subscribe to a company that thinks wasting my time and hard work appropriate to coaxing me into a purchase. Bye, Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Needs more things to do to photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years but this new subscription service is disgusting. Users are dropping like flies, I hope it was worth it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for almost 4 years it was such an amazing app compare to other plus we can use it offline. But now suddenly everything change after editing the image quality is reduced and got blurred."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Suddenly you need a subscription to use the app offline? Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this editing app.. Nice and simple to use. I give it 10/10 for its ability... It's only let down by all the excessive add placements."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"3rd class"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is one of my favorite editing app. But today it asking me to subscribe if you want to use offline. Pixlr is not free anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Because now its not free. :( Since more than 10 years i was using it n uninstalling it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"prefect👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was my favorite photo editing app. But the latest update made me very sad.💔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Would like more options"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"❤️❤️❤️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Okay, I really liked this app...now, you are telling me I have to pay to use it? Sorry, will find a different app going forward."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is great it is easy to use but the quality of the pictures when I am about to save it is sucks. It goes to be a pixelated and so blurry please fix it!."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Been using pixlr for years but ever since you cant use the app offline i refuse to use it. Used to be the only pic editing app i would use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstall. Has gone to scrap."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't believe this... This app changed in to worst app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Cute...App ... And I'm Using above 3 Years...😁😁😁... Mee happy for this Pixlr...😁😁😁 Thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"4 stars instead of 5: Used to be number 1 app for photo art but the Save won't function unless I watch an ad, sometimes MORE than one ad! Every. Single. Time. Held hostage for my work, come on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Been a real good app. But i gotta say, the recent pop up add inclusion is really starting to piss me off."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once upon a time this was my favourite app untill it was free and offline.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Highly enjoyable to experiment with all of the filters, overlays, stickers, etc. I especially like that the collage editor maintains the quality of the original images, something which no other collage maker I've tried has done."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"usefull pakyu"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Must agree with the other reviews. Been using it since 2014. But now I have to seriously consider to uninstall it and find other similar app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WHY do you need access to my calendar events and everything else, etc, including the ability to change things on my device, JUST FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO EDIT PHOTOS OR ARTWORK??????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been doing this for 5 years. But now it is paid and uninstalled. Very bad1"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Amazing at what it does, but definitely needs more options."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now it's garbage, not on my new tablet."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"till date it was my fav editing app, as i am using it for 5 years as it's working OFFLINE- simple edit options, making collages.. but not anymore! the idea of subscription or enable internet is not good. disappointed"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"v bad experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was my favorite app till a few minutes ago, it was suppose to be free and now they want to charge. I cant get to my pictures. So you get a big fat zero"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Don't use it if ur on mobile. Only pc its better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best picture editing app on play store ! I have been using this app for years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Rohit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"‼️📰‼️My ABSOLUTE FAVE photo editor🏆Intuitive, looks pro, options for artistic, complex &/or simple edits & corrections. I used free version for 1yr before paying ~$6? for the full version- well worth it. If you're into photo editing, go on & buy it. This app is far superior to all others I've used (~10 apps/computer programs). Haven't opened another photo editor for months bc I always realize DUH! & switch back to Pixlr asap. BOTTOM LINE: 🆓/low🏷️ ➕ 😍 ➡️ (👏✖️♾)➕(♥️➕👍)✖️💯❕❣️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"2019- I just downloaded this because samsung gallery editor updated and remove all good edition tools, so this app is actually a better alternative than samsung gallery, untill now only suggestion I have is, while doing very precise draws, the eraser isn't the best tool to rely on a miniscule mistake, I would suggest and undo button there aswell. 2020 UPDATE - Don't recommend it anymore, it doesn't let you use it offline anymore, you have to pay for it. 4 stars to 1."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this for years even after getting mobile Adobe apps as it was faster and less involved than having to do both Lightroom and PS. But I uninstalled on the second forced ad. Way to ruin a great app! Goodbye forever :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I love this app except after so long it ask u to pay for it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be something great, now it's just meh! What a disappointment 🤦🏾‍♂️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app,very low feature"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow ......"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love this app been using it to edit for about 10 years, but it's really ridiculous to have to watch a 30+ second ad JUST to be able to save my picture...5 seconds or even 10 seconds I get but 30!!! So not worth it to me 👋"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"'Been using this app since 5 years ago"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I need to go home right now, as in into photo and film editing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love this app and been using it for years now, editing pictures and animating. But how come you need to subscribe and pay in able to continue using this? 😢"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"To echo the other recent reviews, the app used to be pretty nifty but it's gone downhill. Completely disabling access without a subscription while on mobile data and requiring wi-fi use is absurd."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Can you please stop my subscription?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sucks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"forcing users to be online to use the app is pretty low."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save a collage anymore."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"فوق‌العاده‌اس"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Okay. Once upon a time, this was my favorite editing app. It was simple to use, and made very nice edits and collages. I loved using it to make profile aesthetics. But now, I have to pay a fee to use it on mobile data?! This app is quickly turning into a COMPLETE cash grab. I'm fine with having to pay to use certain tools and filters, I guess, but paying to use mobile data? I've never heard anything more dumb."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lmao ruined the experience with subscription. Gtfo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of my most used apps. Now it's just full of glitches and long ads. Cropping pictures gives blurred results everytime. What is the point of having an app that doesn't work? 1 star from a 5 star"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"it only takes so much space but overall good!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I don't like the updated version, asking me to pay monthly"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The smooth feature is great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update completely ruined this app for me. Intrusive ads, pop up features that remove your work, and saved photos that are not the same quality as viewed in the app. If the app had a single payment to remove ads, I might consider it, but not a yearly subscription. You get an uninstall from me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It cannot use off line and frustrated with the ads when connect to internet..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"DISAPPOINTED APP !!!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I really love this app but recently I have a problem with this app. Every text type is just same right now. I can't fix it. I don't know if its about my phone or not. Please help me with this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"old review: Awesome editing app, better than 99% of the paid apps. Heaps of options and easy to use. 5 stars NEW REVIEW: Another trashed app by 123rf Ah well, although i paid a few years back, im now being asked to pay $14+ per year. Just avoid this app. Its not worth the $14+, I did pay a few dollars years ago to remove adds. But no where the massive price their asking now. 1 star guys. You can keep your yearly subscription and stickers. This app blows. 123rf is just garbo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"There is no better of application especially for picture on picture with an eraser mode and a zoom mode. Is it simply the best photo editing!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like the free version btw all u have to do is hit exit when the subscription thing pops up duh 🤣 I didn't get asked to pay to use the editor filters or the others"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now requires subscription??? This was free to use, was useful for a few features...not happy with this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good photo editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was excellent, now its ruined. Time to move on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but now there's a pop up and all your work is lost"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"A good photo editor, nothing to do with the website."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Imagine being so fearful of the fact that people won't be bombarded by ads that you actually go a step further and prevent people from using the app altogether unless they have a good connection. One star until this is fixed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing options for free and perfect for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Parting ways after years as they have started asking for money. Sad."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This was a fine app and I was using it occasionally for about 5 years but it appears they have become a lot more aggressive with ads which is really really annoying to use. Bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Verry verry verrrrrrrreeey ggggooooddss"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The early version, when I installed it a few years ago was good. Now this nasty app wants to totally invade your privacy with TONS of new added permissions. STAY AWAY! I found a photo app called ""photo Editor"" 29mb with WAY less permissions."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Use ful app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ive been using Pixlr for YEARS now. Even stand by it and consider it my holy grail. Now it crashes a lot, just when im about to save. Lost my progress 3 times :) i knew this app was too good to be true."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I used this app before and its very easy to edit photo. Now im installing again to edit my sons tarp."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm surprised that the app is not longer for free lol, thank you so much for the 3 years trial that i used it for free, ""uninstalling"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Requires subscription now, but the app was going down the drain before they got greedy. If you are editing a Pic and if your network connections stops at any moment, they just kick you out of the app and all progress is lost. There is a lot of glitches between brush and text were the output image does not match the canvas in the app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have been using this application for several years. Never had a problem with it. Even better that I can use this app absolutely free without obtrusive and intrusive ads destroying the experience of me modifying pictures."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"best editing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this for years now update wants you pay for it after its always been free🖕🏻douchbaggery at its finest even now it states its free but its not."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's a good app I like it 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Once loved this app. Now I can't access letter style. If you take away. Why not update the app. I take it I need to download a better app. Also make it so when people aren't satisfied with your apps all the rating stars can be removed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Asks for internet connection when i already have it connected, trys to push paid version even though it runs ads. Sad to see such a good app ruined."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Is there any way to add layers of images?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"5 stars if you update so we can add gifs to an image. Like allow us to layer a working gif over an image. I'd pay money to have it on this mobile app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app for photography"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst photo editing experience now.. Although it's my one of the favourite photo editing apps... Hell Lot of glitches... Work not saved properly.. (Only half image appears in gallery) Asks for internet connection when all other apps are working properly on internet and discard incomplete work to BOUND PEOPLE TO TAKE ITS SUBSCRIPTION! This is not the way to beg for subscription!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't use the app without internet? It's sucks! The last update just killed the Pixlr. I'll find another app and I suggest everybody do the same!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"NO USE"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Unable to fill a portion after picking a color."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is very pantastic aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"From 5 star to 1,hate how things turned out"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It wass free, and then there are ads everywhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I wish it wasn't so easy to accidentally leave the app and delete your progress. Otherwise great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but a recent update has completely killed the app for me. It use to save pictures at a high quality, but no longer does, and unskippable minute-long ads have been introduced. You can no longer use the app without an internet connection. Want to ruin a good app? This is how you do it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"rubish"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"R. I. P. 'Pixlr - free photo editor' Now it is Pixlr - pay to edit photos. FFS why though?🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tag shows FREE but Asking money"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, powerful tools for amateur users to work like a pro. My companion in making memories and artworks for many years!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is the first photo shop I ever got on a smart phone or anywhere else really and I will always cherish it for popping my edit cherry so gracefully and gently"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this aap is needs internet connection without any reason this app is very dull"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love using this app it's very useable."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"nice one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Your ads are to long"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"why doesn't the download features in the app does not work? I have reinstalled the app 4 times!!! it says network error and less storage although my net work very good and i have more space in my phone!!!!....!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but now it seems you need to ""subscribe"" and pay. Kind of defeats the ""free photo editor"" if this doesn't change i sadly will need to delete and find another app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love ❤️ it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible and very bad app for editing pictures. Not only does it bring picture quality significantly down, after a year the double exposure function is still giving issues. When saving the picture it does not look anything like what you've just edited... Major disappointment!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"remove ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"A forced subscription after having the app for years is beyond ridiculous. So shady."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love editing pictures. So i highly recomend pixlr!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have to agree with everyone else. What the hell happened? This was my favorite editing app, and I've been using it for years, and I just got on, and now you have to pay to use offline? Literally the name of the app on the Play Store is ""Pixlr – [FREE] Photo Editor."" Didn't know it was possible for a ""free"" editing app to be pay-to-win. Definitely not coming back."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice one 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using Pixlr for years. Absolutely loved it as an app for editing photos etc but now I have to pay to use the app? Absolutely not. How about recognising the users that have had this app for so long and rewarding them in some way instead of charging them to use it. I know that I have recommended this app to loads of people but now I will be looking elsewhere and giving my loyalty to someone else's app. Well done on ruining a perfectly good app. I'll see you around Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Really good app, you can put some really cool foregrounds on your pictures👍 I have been reading some other comments so I decided to check and to be honest there are a lot of ads. If anyone is reading this you can also try Chroma Lab it is now my go to editing app🙂"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice...,👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"My name is Ab noob Ab Pro Ab"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So i paid to remove ads and i got 3 days of ad free enjoyment, then after taking my money ... they sent an email saying my subscription was canceled. Back to repetitive ads that take over 20 seconds, before i can save or share. This is so wrong !!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The text and picture quality of this app has decreased dramatically. Everything is pixelated now. I've used this app for over 5 years but I'm thinking of getting rid of it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Like the app, but poses some data privacy issues."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"* must be connected to the internet to use * ads broken on my very common pixel phone * GREEDY even by app standards * Realized my camera app (OpenCamera) has all the editing features i need without any ads or nonsense"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"now I'm delete this aap becouse is top to bottom money asked..I hate this aap"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"erupt"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Pretty solid app. Wish they would go for more banner ads and avoid those long and inrusive ads though. Other than that, I have made some pretty epic pictures easily. I even trolled my grandparents into thinking I was at a beach."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"it was the best photo editing apps i have ever used, BUT now, not anymore. The requirement to be connected to the internet just to edit photo is pure stupid. uninstall and 1 star(for the sake of past experience)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love using this app most especially on skin editing. But i've noticed the ads and the app asking me to subscribe or i can't use it offline anymore..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great app that can't I can't even use. It loads up, can edit images, but can't save changes. Uninstall/clear cache and reinstall doesn't help."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As of this posting, Pixlr gives conflicting information and misleading statements in their About Section. This app used to be free but suddenly it has stopped allowing edits and said that in order to use the program, you must pay their subscription fee in order to use this program. There was no advanced notice to those who use the service that popped up inside the app. The way they worded their About Me gives the following contradicting details. Quality also has degraded. Don't waste your time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Why must online whayyyyyy It'smy best editing app :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Anybody knows a better app than this one? Please post it and let's boycott Pixlr for good. This one sucks big now!! Why the hell did you have to put ads that shows in the middle of a project? Idiots!!! 🤦‍♀️🤬"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The app is filled with amazing features but there seems to be an issue where it drops the quality of my photos I import by great deal. I dont understand the exact issue but it basically downscales them greatly. Fatal flaw."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Guys yiu were the best, now the worst. I understand everyone needs money. But not as that much as you're asking for! Everyone would download your app and pay for it if it was like 5$ for the whole year. But not like now. Sorry, deleting..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice photo editor.i like this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be good.. 😭"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever ! After editing pixels get distorted ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It took awhile to learn. I liked a previous app better, bit it was discontinued."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Never use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app does everything I need…for my work & fun.I'm happy as.Thanks you mob!Cpt Stix out!! :-)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was great. But since they had this ""subscription* thing, I uninstalled it immediately. It sucks, bigtime. App said it's free, but now it needs internet...and not just internet, but WiFi!? Ridiculous! And you need to pay when you work on this app offline? Whatdafok was that? Nah, don't be fooled by the ""free photo editor"". Waste of time to install this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"begging for rating in the middle of editing process, and when i rejected all my editing is gone. you begging for rating huh?? here i give you one , stupid developer"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app comes with a network error when trying to change t he text that you tipe please fix Edit: i figured it out , it wasnt my network , it was you greedy bastards that added a subscription so you can use stickers and fonts This app has gone down the drain , why cant people enjoy a good app without having to pay , WHAT HAPPENED"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The worst editing app ever used the features there is nothing amazing in this app this is not at all creative very less features those are also not too nice or good. A suggestion: add more creative effects , transitions , frames and make it feel like pro."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid once to remove the ads, now they're charging more and its just bad now. :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used Pixlr for about 4 years, and it's always been my go-to photo editor. Something changed in the last few weeks. From quality of processing of pics, to now intrusive 1 min ads you have to sit thru just to save your photo. And most of the time, those ads don't even load right--- causing errors. Now you have to subscribe? Whaaa? I get you want to make money, but there are better ways in implementing that than ruining a good app. It's been good run, Pixlr, but this is where I get off. 👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"As a nostalogic apps. I am using last 6 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"The text editor should come with shadowing out outlines."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good app to edit"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is good with soooo many filters. But please add a lifetime purchase only to remove ads (my opinion)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very nice app using since childhood cool features like you can erase your filter also so very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now i cant use it offline...unless i pay... and also photos are not saved as you edit them. Whats the point then?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app used to be one of my favourites for picture editing. Now it seems like it's simply getting worse and worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Bad Experience. While editing, ads pop up, losing focus on what I was doing. I love all the features that it has and the work flow, but not any more. I tried running the app under airplane mode but they won't let you. Bummer."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years. I also use the web version on my laptop. Love it. I would really like to see a Meme text added to the app for smartphones. Thank you for making this app user friendly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They really killed off a lot of features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: That's it! DELETED! After all these years (2013). I was forced to watch not one but TWO 30 second ads, one in the middle of editing, another before I could save. I don't mind ads at the top or bottom of the page but I'm NOT ok being forced to watch an ad for 30 seconds, especially twice in a matter of minutes."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"USED to be good however now it's terrible money hungry adware garbage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So HELPFUL"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"What was once a great app is now worth nothing more than a simple piece of human waste! Im pissed I spent an hour working on something for it to delete it before I had a chance to save because these greedy money hungry roaches want money! I would have paid once I had the extra money my work didnt need to be deleted because my internet faded for a moment! You used to be able to use this app offline but you change it to force money from people and thats disgusting!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like it nothing wrong with it I rarely use it but it's still goor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"why I am unable to download all fonts.... Love this app but please do something about it..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Tons of effects,frame/text options.I've been using it for a few years and use it almost every day.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have to agree with the other comments. This was my go to app. The ads were annoying but the editing abilities kept me. I'll admit that the ads were so bad I disabled internet for the app. Now, can't use it all at. It's either the ads or nothing so I guess I'm forced into nothing. Uninstalling and never coming back."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the time that I'm going to let you go. It's not free anymore ""Uninstall"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Been using their app for years, even after changing several phone models. I'm a big fan. There were ads but acceptable.. Now it's fully a paid app.. I didn't read carefully the pop out message thinking it was an ad and clicked on the X and i get booted out from the app. Doesn't feel good about it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I like the app. Easy yet sophisticated!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"♥️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You are now forcing people to pay for offline mode. What to do when there is no Internet? Looks like Pixlr has a new owner as they are offering only paid subscription now. Dumping it now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but now it's not worthy it subscription for everything you cannot even crop a picture without subscribing that's just too much"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Photo banane ke liye photo per naam likhane ke liye Pixlr download"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This used to be my favorite app, but its gone down the drain now! First, the quality is nothing like it showed in the app! The quality used to be perfect.... What happened??? And now, i hate that you are forcing people to buy subscription. Not everyone can afford it! I absolutely loved when we could use the app offline. It was my favorite passtime. But now i cant! Definitely unfair. Not to mention it doesnt even hardly work when my wifi is ON. Please change it back..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Broken. Can't even view the images through the app in the apps own directory without it locking up completely. VERY disappointing as I've often recommended this very app to friends and colleagues."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Perfect, every single edit is just perfect!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this so much"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to use Pixlr loyally to add effects to my photos and artworks, and it did the job brilliantly. I am appauled that I have to pay to use the app offline now, and all the ""free"" overlays and borders are now behind a paywall. I would have considered paying, but stating I will pay 7.99 for the first year, then when I go to checkout saying 11.49 is my first payment is flat out misadervtising. Disappointed, especially as, even though I do think its still a robust editor, files always save as jpg"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The amount of intrusive ads has OVERWHELMED this app! Disruptive ads get in the way! Please stop"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Eh its ight."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not a good editor app. Crashes all the time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a dream app, now it's a nightmare! Now with the new update, it sucks! You must pay or subscribe. The ads are annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads. Used to love it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Everytime my data cuts out, I'm prompted to pay for the premium version of the app before it deletes all of my edits. Cmon dude. I'll deal with the ads but don't be this petty. Otherwise robust and functional."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It started out amazing. I used this app because it was the best. Almost ever since it first launched. Now they want subscriptions to use the app offline and they throw ads at you constant left and right. How unnecessary and disgusting. Uninstalled immediately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for several years , lately they've added ads when saving photos...fine, I can tolerate that as it is a free app. Today I wanted to edit a photo and it asked me to connect to internet (I was) or pay for some subscription to use it offline. Uninstalled, looking for another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"With Pixlr photo editing app is my main go to editing app it has lots capabilities where as other apps u meed download other apps in order to edit your photos, etc. 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hard to use & recently asking for subscription. Appearently ads was not enough and they decided to collect users information. Uninstall. Wooooooaaaa"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"जानू तुम लेट हो गई तेरे चक्कर में तेरी सहेली सेट हो गई"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Like all have said, I too am a very old user of Pixlr. And infact it is one of the first photo editors I've ever used on phone, never needed another. But now I can't even save my pictures. Especially when I make a collage, the ratios are distorted. And there has been no updates from developers since like beginning of the year. All other makers keep updating. You guys can't stay blind to your now-heavily bugged app. It's very sad that such a great app is losing its sheen now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It works Edited to one star, it does NOT work, ads are atrocious, crashing, etc, overall a terrible experince. Was good now its trash"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not very bad photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dont waste your time, they all of a sudden tryna charge now after I been using it for years never had to deal with them trying to charge that's the reason I stayed with them for years but now all of a sudden they charging let alone that they charge way more then what the app is even worth. After years I'm finally out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Screen goes black whenever I try to do double exposure and the gallery is supposed to launch"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"very useful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Geart"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr...USED TO BE COOL!! USED TO BE!! I used it all the time! Now, every single time I try to save an edit... i have to wait through at least 3 ads! I know its free, but dam, give me a reason to use your app again! UNINSTALLING !!!! I would give zero stars, but of course, theres no option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You were favourite..... Now its time to leave....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They install various apps onto your phone without permission or your knowledge, the quality of pictures drops dramatically, (ex: Original pic is 1080p and drops to 144p) why not use PicsArt or phonto guys? Its way better and has better controls. Also isn't a parasite."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Asomw"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app it has become now. Fix it kindly. Loved to use before this edition."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not working in offline........"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Your app is compromised, you might want to take a look at the minutia of the program. Up until this point I have thoroughly enjoyed the application overall, but I refuse to use it in the condition it's in ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is the best photo editor app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It became bad and uesless i used to use it but no more"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Awful. Can't get past splash screen. Tells me need to subscribe to use it. DON'T DESCRIBE IT AS FREE WHEN ITS NOT. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It used to be great but the video ads make it impossible to update images reliably. The ad starts playing before changes can be saved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is best app for editing. And plz uptdate the app and added background change pics"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years! Got a new phone recently and went to download this app onto my new phone and discovered that it wasn't free anymore..Like I was fine with the ads that would pop up at times, I can't even use it offline much less online unless I paid for it..such a wonderful app gone down the drain. For as much as I love this app, I will not pay a dime on it, I hope they make it free again and fix their mistake."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I Love this app! Very simple and easy!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't save edited pictures with out ad interference."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Recommended for more than double dozen peoples myself. Used to be the best. Eventually they were putting more and more ads, which i don't mind as they were revenue for the app makers.But later become targeted ones, still adjusted thinking it's everywhere in this age. Now need a subscription to open the app which is nothing but greed. There are nearly a million apps free in app stores with similar or more features. So good bye to an old friend. (Whoever made this decision is a company killer)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Just a reminder here U can be against Pixlr move to put pop-up delay ads after editing. So download all the free filters when in editing mode, then BLOCK ""background data"" on this app (if your phone is on Android 10, or already have this option on older android version). You'll still get pop-up but video ad doesn't appear, just unstable pic ad that can be exit in no time. However, I found out the subscription isn't expensive tho. Still gonna use it anyway whatever Pixlr just gone stupid. 💁‍♂️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice tool for quick photo editing but i jusy realized the crop function is so buggy that i cant use the app much anymore. If you crop the source image about to half size the saved image has correct resolution but the image quality is garbage. The pixels are filtered to 1/4 quality. After cropping everything looks garbage. Its like i cropped 1024x image even the source was 4k"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"top app for editing And we can use this app for thamnail writing for YouTube's 👌👌👌👐"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used Pixlr since the beginning. Now it won't even let me use it unless I connect to the internet or else I have to buy a subscription"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great app gone bad with the intrusive ads. To save 1 photo, you must sit through a 30 second video ad that you cannot escape. I have had this app for several years as a trusted app for photo edits. I was fine with the ads as they were because they have to make money somehow. I don't edit enough to warrant a paid app, but now I may just find another app and pay for it in spite. Bad move Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love you girls sex"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app is very nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Naved shah"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this for years. With the latest changes I have deleted the app and will use something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I changed phones and now i am unable to download packs....it says to check network or storage but they are both fine"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This update has caused me to uninstall because now you have to subscribe to use it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Always my favorite needs filters. 7/31/20 Should make all filters and stickers free"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Auto contrast could be better instead of looking like a deep-fried meme filter. More customisation would be better in terms of picture exiting options. As well as an updated layout"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free with ads then totally changed to a pay version. Currently this app is not free!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for years. Suddenly it won't open files or respond at all and none of the troubleshooting fixed the issue. I'd keep the app if actually worked."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Goood"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app ever never recomend for editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"How its free?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My favorite photo editing app ever and now it won't let me past ""enable internet"" or subscribe. My internet is enabled! I've turned it off and back on numerous times to no avail. Seems intentional that I can't edit any photos without paying now. So just come out and say it! no longer free.Recently, ads have become super invasive, taking over my screen! Ads on top of save button! I was seriously considering buying the app. No more. Uninstalling. SUGGESTIONS FOR REPLACEMENT??????????"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Many options, easy to use and navigate, I use this app all the time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used Pixlr for my photos since 2013, and I have always loyally used it. I just realized that they put in intrusive apps. Fine. I can almost deal with that, except now when I save my edited photos, they look horrible. The quality is low, there is a blue hue to the pictures. They look nothing like the picture I edited on the app. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed that you guys are trying to force people to purchase a subscription this way. I'm uninstalling and using Adobe."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I made a two-star review before, but I'm taking one more away. I've loved this app for six years, tolerating the ads since I know it can help the devs, but disabling offline editing is just absurd. It's sad that this is no longer a free app. I will install this app again once this feature is removed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ive use this app for years. The recent update makes this advertisment as a free app completely false. You might be able to start an edit, but in the middle of your changes a pop up will overtake your work asking you to pay for their app. You will also be kicked out of what you were working on with all progress lost. Free is a blatently false and misleading headline for their app now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"What I actually from this app is the bloat tool..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened to the functional tools? I came back to this app to see it has been crippled in functionality. It appears the tools have been replaced with filters. Avoid this neutered app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was really good until ruined it with Ads. Extremely slow, doesn't save images properly, clickbait type ads. There are better alternatives."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"UI is absolute trash. When I try to draw on images, the screen is hard locked in the color editing, blocking half the image I can draw on. Removing this via every button I've tried locks me out of the ability to draw. Get a different app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Change your App name from Pixlr to Adslr. Can't even use this application Now. You've made a mistake please fix that other than this it was the best application I've been using."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"720 nehi de sakta...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling this app. Why do we have to subscribe mandatorily? This app was good, deserved 5 stars. But what is this now? Atleast some features should be free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why this app requires permission for my physical activity"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Hahaha holy ads 🤣🤣"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free app that isn't free... great. I've been using this app for YEARS and it was fantastic. Then the ads became crazy intrusive and even then I gritted my teeth and went with it because it worked so well. Now it's a PAID app. This is a BS move. It's still titled ""Free Photo Editor"" I will regrettably uninstalling this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free photo editor advertised and has been free for years now subscription based. Won't allow me to edit without subscribing. Absolutely terrible bait and switch!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"gooooood"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"💩💩💩"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not so good not bad..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The stupidest app ever, doesn't even give you help....smh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Old I best now it turned to unusable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app loveliy app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"😇"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very creative and helpful app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Don't ask money."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالیه"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it, update I moved phones but it isn't allowing my year access"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years. Great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Screw the ads they pretty much force You to lose your progress and what you were making or buy a shity $7 subscription you don't need or want"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this regularly for ages. It's been so useful for me when creating all sorts of graphics and editing photos. However, the latest update has made it unusable for me. If you don't subscribe, then you're not able to use anything. I see from the other reviews that I'm not the only one who feels this way either. Sadly, my only option is to look for something else that's both usable and free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing and used regularly. Latest update takes away the great functionality and charges a premium price for using what used to be free. Deleted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is all fun and games until you check your device storage and see, that Pixlr occupies not more not less than 750 Mb of the device's precious storage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great beast photo editor ever!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I agree with the other recent reviews, the latest version immediately resulted in me uninstalling Pixlr. I was okay, putting up with the in-app ads, but this new approach makes it no longer a free app and I will not abide this mischievous subscription, and turn on the always connected """"""feature"""""". I am reporting for false/misleading claims. Other than that, it's a wonderful and useful app, the best I know. I'll come back if this huge mistake is repaired."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"They just had to F up a good app as usual. $$$ driven"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app WAS good, back when the ads were normal. Now they're so intrusive it's nigh impossible to actually use the app. Half the time they just pop up with an error message anyhow, so... 🤷‍♀️ I have no idea what the devs thought they would accomplish, but all they managed to do was ruin their app, as the ads are obviously not effective since they can't even be seen much of the time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice worked"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I don't recommend the mobile app, but I really really love the pc version. The PC version is EXELLENT! 👍👌👏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"✨👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Out of all the pic editors that i have tried over many years, this is and has always been the best, my fav."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and would recommend it to anyone looking for an awesome editor. Not anymore. Just today I edited a photo and sent it to someone via text message and it came through completely blurred. To test if maybe it was a one-off thing, I edited and sent another and the same thing happened -the pic was blurred. I'm guessing this is Pixlr's new strategy to force people to start paying for it. Aren't the ads good enough? Pretty sleezy if you ask me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"love"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, but now ads pop up every time you try to save a photo. When you're finally given the option to close the ad another one pops up right behind it. You have to close the entire app and start the editing process over which makes the app kinda pointless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use this app for 3 years but now i move to google snapseed because this new update is sucks. I can't do editing offline. Please bring back the old pixlr.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What went wrong? I used to love this App. I paid money to access all filters and it still won't let me use them. I called tech support, followed their advice, and it's still not working. Save your money people. Use the free app if you'd like. What a shame. I used to rave about this app. Not anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Money hungry. Free my arse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love the editing options.. this app is always a must"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pahly wala app acha tha Bkwas hai ab plz free kro isy mary liya Free kro"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app. My favourite free photo editor for years. But it was getting progressively worse with every update... Now almost half of the features have to be paid for, even though there are ads. However, I understand that the company needs money. Also, the photos look normal in the editor, then I save them and choose the Max quality option... And in the gallery they look all blurry. I tried re-installing the app but it didn't help. I have to delete it permanently"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to bee good but now with ads they sux. I mean, if they have pro paid version I'd pay but this way... Nah"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good editing broadcast"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Thirty second ads every time you switch screens. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love to use these app.. but recent update add n subscription just huhhhhhh"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WAS a best photo editing app.. This recent update Internet Subscription has ruined the experience of editing and it doesn't even work when Net is on, you need WiFi.. Why the hell would I want Internet ON for editing my pics through layouts and filters that are already downloaded.. If there was a ""No star"" I would have rated that too.. Bawasir bana diye ho"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be good now the app has ads everywhere"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Jerk not offline oh come on too many ads and looks like Instagram I'll rate this 1 star"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Um i don't like it.. there is less option"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"New update sucks .....whenever i use blur or brighten effect , after saving the photo the effects disappear ....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow so beautiful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"this version freezez up..idky...though. its a very good app..hope they resolve this..thanks.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this app, and generally carry it on my cell for the pic editing! It has all the basic general tools to do so. 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lol used this for a year or 2 and was perfect now i can't use without subscription and can't use from mobile data for some reason demands wifi. ad pop ups constant. Don't download."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used it for YEARS.... The 30 second add is ridiculous. Wish u never messed with it or at least a pay option to get the adds off. * added, Now more pay walls. This is officially been deleted. Bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I was perfectly satisfied with this app until today, when it randomly starts asking me to subscribe to work offline. Except I'm not offline. It's making the app completely unusable"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I will not recommend this app now to others it's a garbage now the developers of this app are become greedy now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"A Etty and I don't a series m very soon a set of a a m awe I love you b Iraq andat a time as well as the WA I don't know what Aero"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love the different fonts and the transparent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"goooiod"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"version 3.4.39 is the most garbage update ever, used to be a great editing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is a best app for 'color splash','blur'.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a reasonable good app but off late it's disgraceful....."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest update is a downfall"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App is good but could be better. For example, double exposure feature doesn't default to same size & must be resized by hand making impractical. The stickers are super cheesy and outdated designs imo. Basic photo editing it works. Update: The new version has so many ads it is not worth it. Look elsewhere if you ask me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it! Use it all the time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not at all what I wanted to use this for. Probably a great app Just not for me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Please fix this app. I have been using it for years and loved it until it became unusable. It locks up 9/10 times I try to use it. I don't mind ads, but I do mind a useless app. And whomever is paying for ads on this app is wasting their money. Half the time I don't even see an ad, it just locks up."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have internet running perfectly. Still it doesn't allow me to edit. Can you stop being so intrusive."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app it help me to make my photo"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You stupid update has broken the app. I used it to edit Photos with minor ads. But this persistent Internet Connection is not only an annoying feature, but you have deliberately implemented it in such a way that it pop up in between editing even when internet is live. And why in the world do you need internet are you recording our personal photos and edits by every second or you just want to annoy people into paying for subscription. You all do know that Snapseed still free without ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"A few months ago I would recommend this app 100% but now I won't, they got too greedy with the ads it has come to a point where it slows down all the process of saving your photo, it takes forever just to do that simple task, usually I don't mind ads (I understand they need to get money) but this app right now it's too much, fortunately this is not the only app on the store and I think I found another one much better, pitty, I used to love this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Previously that was good but now it works only online and have much ads just hate it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be good. Now garbage. Don't work without internet connection. Not recommended."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years but now there are constant ads, says to establish internet when you're already on the internet, i dont its garbage now so i guess its time to delete the app and go to a better editor"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"A 12 second ad just so I can save my item now? Pff, I'll just screenshot my work and avoid the ad all together."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"bad update : was absolutely phenomenal until this subscription update, i use data 24/7 but im only allowed to edit using wifi ? how does that even make sense ? change the ""free"" in your name to ""wifi"", that way theres at least consistency. especially since this app was my 'go to' , kind of a bummer . the other guy is right : id rather buy an app once over a monthly subscription. id sooner pay adobe month to month 🤣"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Awful ads everywhere cant get to image to crop, you click n more ads pop up then you loose image its rediculous tried app and uninstalled immediately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Huh, this doesn't work offline , you're not allow to use it unless subscribe???!!! ... Very disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The editing tools and effects are best but its online working sucks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This was my go-to app for uploading to Instagram on my Droid Turbo 2. However, on my Z4 when I attempt to upload to Instagram, Pixlr says I need to install Instagram first. It IS installed. I have reinstalled both programs and Pixlr does not recognize Instagram."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"this works so well on the computer. I edited a huge photo combo in 1 HR. woah"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good one earlier but now they have started taking money to use the software, not work for me anymore.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"After using it for so many years now im going to uninstall because now pixlr need money and monthly subscritpion...disappointment"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo aditor aap"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best Photoeditor ever simple to use and have all the necessary tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst piece of garbage ever"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using for years. Now, after accepting it with ads, they are only allowing use with an annual fee. BYE FELICIA. Plenty of other free apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Stupid app... Cant even try the trial version. Forcing to enable payment option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Haaa team please remove that restriction you are putting ... yes we know you want to make money but please ey"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Makan storage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app (the previous versions were my primary photo editor for years) but after the most recent update, it's garbage. It no longer functions without a persistant web connection. I was fine with their old, in-app ads (everyone's gotta make a living) but if you have to pay for a usable app, then you're better off buying a fully-featured version from one of the big developers (Adobe, for example) and pay for it ONCE, rather than do a monthly subscription from this company. 🙄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is my best app for my photos. I use it in 2018."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why the hell do you need Internet to use this app? It's forcing users to subscribe to a monthly or annual fee. If you're offline, it won't even let you use the app. This is beyond ridiculous. I've been using this app for years but this is unacceptable. Uninstall until you get your heads straight again"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great photo editor but not anymore"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I need 5:4 crop size for sending pics to Instagram. Please add ""5:4"" to ""crop"""
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be awesome until all these apps and everything have now arrived on it there are way better everything out there now Tumut prices and free ones it's a pity because this was good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing photography Application I love it But Internet Is Not Important"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"awesome.. maybe the best for mobile. BUT ANNOYING ADS!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Seeing it is from Hong Kong I am guessing the problems happened when the CCP took over. Not worth even trying now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for a long time, now it tells me I need to be connected to the internet to use it, WHICH I AM, and it still only gives me the option to subscribe. I don't mind ads, but I this app is either broken or they're trying to force payment by insisting there's no internet connection. Scam!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Too many ads that run too long. Not paying to have account. Used to be a great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"It is good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Use to be good now it's forcing me to subscribe, uninstalled."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Ye ek yese photo grp he Mujhe bahut achi lagi"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash. Sure you can edit photos and do some fancy tricks. . . . .but if you leave the app for a few minutes or your phone locks itself after a couple seconds automatically, and you go back into the app, you lose ALL your progress and have to start from scratch. Not to mention the countless of times it told me that the app stopped working/responding and it kicked me out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I spent 15 minutes to make a perfect edit and after the safe i get completely different image, overexposed and bad colors... nothing even close to the way i edited"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app, almost daily, for more than 5 years and now I need an internet connection to use and I need to pay? Why? What kind of customer service is that? Y'all really screwed up a good thing!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its great. love pixlr so much🙏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Quality of the image drops after editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be my absolute number one favorite app...now you guys have changed every dang thing about it. It's useless and a waste of dang time now. I do NOT recommend this to ANYONE anymore."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Supebbbbbb...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So nice app my photo is best eaditing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Disgusting and worst app now. Previously it was goof now it wont work and save any image without enabling internet access. I think this app start data stealing. 👎 Unistalling right now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not free and requires a subscription after a few days. Used to be free once upon a time but don't let the weasels fool you with the misleading title. They just want downloads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Polish is better. This doesn't have as many effects."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads that stop you proceeding for 30 seconds or more."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"V.good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't overlay photos from my own gallery. The overlay has to be chosen from their gallery of sparkles etc. This is not what I wanted. I have 2 clear background images I need to overlay and haven't found an app YET that can do this!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app is very good for photo edits. But nowadays it is not working. Everytime it is asking to connect to internet though it is connected to internet. Offline it doesnot work. Looks like developer wants to make it paid app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love to use this apps. But just recently, my fav font that i've used for many yrs all gone and i have to download everything back. But when I try to download, it gives me insufficient storage / network error message. I can't finish my work all of the sudden..tried uninstall this apps and all other apps just to make more space, but there still error message... Lost my times to make money after MCO also. So dissapointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its op"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice app to edit photos"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Well done pixlr! Now you want us to pay you to use your app. Wow that was unexpected! Gonna find another free photo edting app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"More than 3 years i used this app.Good app, but now too much adds, offline we cant use this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Amazing app, don't do the last update, it just puts a million adds onto what was a fine bit of software."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice app 🖤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"This app has awesome editing functions, but the ads now are TERRIBLE. It literally won't let you save your photo until you watch a Very long ad for a video game. It never used to be this bad, it must have recently updated. Very disappointed, most likely will be uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app dont waste ur tym"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I can't use it anymore, it's asking me for subscription and it boots me out to menu when I try to exit it. I use this application predominantly offline because I get frequent internet problems with 2.4ghz devices, but this is the nail in the coffin and lord oh mighty there were many before that"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Premium for offline use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great . Now it won't let me do anything wants me to pay a monthly subscription fee. Not doing that as I don't use it daily or anything. Sucks because I loved this app so much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I had been using Pixlr for years, for specific editing purposes, however a recent update has made it so almost everything is in an extremely low resolution and now it is practically unusable for me..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now uninstalled, after payqall demands, and noisy ads,never time I try and do something. A great app ruined."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was good until it started demanding online access aka no offline access for free version. The worse thing is that the app does not even recognise that IS in fact online"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's a nice editor, but I don't recommend it. It compresses images before loading them into the editor and happens regardless of image format. It's barely noticeable on small images, but if you take a large image and crop it a few times you will see what I mean. The cropping feature is a bit broken. E.g. the square crop isn't always exactly 1:1, instead of 1080x1080 it's 1080x1079. Don't use this app for large images. Giving it a one star until they fix these issues."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice app but I would give you 5 when you would bring back the History Brush ."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Up until now, it was my favorite photo editing app but now it keeps asking for subscription and cuts off when offline. Too bad I guess. I'm not in shortage of photo editing apps, it was just a matter of getting used to it. I'd give it no stars if it was possibly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"👎👎👎👎Don't Download this App"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tooo much expensive"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was excellent and unabtrusive with ads for a long time. Recently started shoving pop-ups everywhere though. Find a different app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best photo editing app out there. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now that I have to ""sign in"" to use offline your app is DELETED. Good work."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great app. Not anymore. It has in app store purchases and ads. But now they added that you have to be connect online to use the app. A stupid added new restriction. My phone says has full strength data and wifi and it won't let me connect. It just keeps getting worse. Dev team or marketing team are making it worse."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!!!!😘🤗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was great until intrusive ads started bogging down the up, one even started downloading a game without ny consent. Bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Had this app for a very long time always comes in handy."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app until all of the services were not free anymore and you had added commercials and they want you to subscribe if you use the app offline which is completely pointless"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very usefil"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"What the f- we have to pay for offline use now? I was really enjoying the app thus far until you pulled this stunt :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Broke my heart"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Hours of my work wasted as the app crashed in midway"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why we use net👎👊👊👊👊👊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worse app 💩💩💩💩"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"lots of fun"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and was my go to photo editing app. Now they have ads all of a sudden and it's super annoying, especially when trying to edit multiple photos. If it was like a couple dollars to upgrade, I would have just done it. But it's a monthly or yearly fee, which is lame. Looking for a new photo app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I like"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"would not download to my chromebook."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"STILL BOYCOTTING !!! I can't believe you guys, no longer free?? BYE !!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ads getting more aggressive lately"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ther was really nothing to it just basic stuff"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but uninstalled today. The new ads are unbearable. I am so disappointed. The fact that I have to watch a video to eit my picture now is unacceptable. My time counts."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's app is amazing . I have been using it from a long time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App WAS great. Now its a literal paywall to use the images you make. It pretends you can watch an ad or two before being able to download your image. But the ads literally never stop. I dont know why the developers would shoot themselves in the foot like this but they did."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr WAS my MUST-HAVE photo editing app, UNTIL they began charging money this past month in order to use it. SO disappointed, and so is my husband who's been using Pixlr even longer than I have. We would have much rather had Pixlr the way it was for free, instead of being charged money for a few updates and changes. It's completely ruined this app for the both of us. I'm so saddened. :("
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"🤍🖤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wants all info and to download tons of extras. Use to be great but now requires you to download extras just to use the app. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Garbage hidden payment"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I Love it 😘"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Until recently I highly recommended this app to many of my friends who'd ask how I'd achieve cool effects with my photos. In the past couple of weeks, however, this app is plagued with crazy pop ups and ""error"" msgs when I try to save my file; I'm guessing in an attempt to inconvenience users enough that they'd opt into the ad free version? Whatever the reason, I've found several other apps which I'll gladly use instead. Hopefully the developers will change it back."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Great app.....but not free if you are offline. And now never seems to connect via wifi"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not possible to use the erasing option... please fix it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I absolutely loved this app! I've used it for years, but in the last few months my saved pictures are deleting. I've lost so much and I can't get them back. Please fix!!! I don't suggest you should use this app until they fix it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Please bring back the old pixlr. 💔 I've been using your app since ages and been recommending it to my friends for how useful it is 😭 Unfortunately, I can't edit pictures now because I'll have to subscribe. Please bring back the old pixlr. 😭🙏🏻💔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Function are not working now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love u"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"App Not working so well lately! Even though I paid. Disappointed!😝"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for years but stupidly updated it. Now it SUX!!!! It gets worse by the day! If you FIX IT, ill give bacc 5 stars, otherwise, DIE SLOW PIXLR!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why we must get paid service? Totally a Gutter.!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Please add some more features like pics art. They have lot of cool tools"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"USED to be great the greatest photo editing app! Then they started adding ads and now you have to pay.. Used it for years for free, what a disappointment!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Boo 👎👎👎👎 so now i need to pay the pixlr apps just to access all the tool.. I have a bunch of editing tools thats free to use... I will not encourge my team friends to istall this app.. Such a disappointment 🥵"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Zoom is not smooth, too aggressive. Read the license agreement, good read but could be written in half the words. Good app, doesn't suit though. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ive been using this app for a long time. But now i cant do anything offline without a paid subscription. If yall make most of your money off ads then remove this. No one is going to buy you the subscription because you removed a offline access and forced a paywall on it. This isnt a way to get people to buy the subscription its a way yall lose users and ad revenue"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"One full screen add for each time I touch the screen"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I liked pixlr And i used it since 5 years But now a days When It updated on leatest version its not working perfectly When every my internter Connection gone slow my workout was Stop And Subcribe now / Enable internet Will appear on screen It ask forr 3 days free trail and purchase.. I hate this update And now i decided to Uninstall pixlr And install another best one.. RIP pixlr 2020"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Sorry for uninstal."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Extremely limited in any type of editing, collages, non existent backgrounds, not very user friendly either. And when you upload a pic with words & edit it even a little bit, when you save it, it's blurry. The only thing I do like is the array of filters but that's the only thing this app is halfway decent for."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The ads on this are really annoying and intrusive. Why would anyone want to use this lol 👎🏽"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It makes images extremely pixelated. Used to be my favourite editor but now the images I edit look terrible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are obnoxiously intrusive"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's nice, but you need to have wifi so you can use it....... But it's good and nice.... I love it... <3"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Cool 💜✌️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"hi i spent an hour editing a photo and all my progress was gone because i went to my music app for 2 quick seconds just to change a song :') 🧚‍♀️"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is my only ""go to app"" for any photo editing I do on my mobile device. Hands down it is the best!!! I LOVE IT!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"THIS IS A GOOD APP!! 10/10 ppl say there are ads but they are none when I installed it. I would highly recommend it im my YouTube channel! 😔👌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Jump in Ad ad ad ad ad ad ad so disappointing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best photo editing app I've ever used on my phone. And it's free. So many options. So many preset boarders, styles, filters. I've used it for years and have become quite adept with it. One issue I have is when erasing part of a filter or layer over the picture, you can't undo your last stroke if you messed up, you have to start all over again and this can be very annoying if I have been working on it for a while. Other than a few minors issues like that, this is an amazing app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. I don't mind with the ads for past years. For the recent updates, the ads are very very very ridiculous. Have to wait for 30 seconds to save the picture."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"So"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Omg ! I have used pixlr for YEARS happily . .I can't believe they added these awful adds. And to top it off it's Facebook and Instagram like everyone doesn't already have that. Saving a picture quickly has become so annoying now when I use pixlr I just get angry and I feel betrayed . I'll be finding a new app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"NO LONGER FREE NEEDS INTERNET FOR ANY USE. DO NOT USE !!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice....supeb editing apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"User friendly and I do all my graphics, album covers etc. Love this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work for me"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad, you can't even Edit a picture easily But the Website Pixlr is too better"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Once I just loved pixlr. But these days I don’t know why saving images after edit is getting difficult. Every time after 50% it’s not saving. Saying please wait and getting stuck on that 50 or 25%. These seems very much problematic."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr was one ma favourite editing app. Bt now its advertisements annoying me.. very irritable.. so i uninstalled it.. thank you.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Old version is best while compiring with new. Will you introduce the old version again plzz"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"what the h*ll... really. everything was going fine ..until i upgrade this. turning it heaven to h*ll"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Just had to update my rating (from 2 years ago) as the ads have become disruptive. And the offline subscription policy is a disaster. What happens when your signal or wi-fi drops? You cannot use the app! Disappointing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good up until it neuters itself by forcing a paywall. Not actually free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Used to be incredible! I've been using it for years, but the update that brought in video ads needs to be fixed. The ads are fine, but they will come up constantly while you're doing stuff, and you can't skip them. If you're going to show ads longer than 30 seconds, I'd like to be able to skip it after five seconds or so, like in other apps"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Like all these other reviews I'm seeing, I LOVED this app and used it all the time. Ads made it annoying, and paywall made it unusable. I might have considered paying for extra features improving on the original, but it is horrendous now. Very sad to delete, as I felt like it could really 'work' this app and make cool content. I hope it improves"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Most functions don't work at all..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not able to download the image after making the collage."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use pixlr for about 5 years since autodesk is still the developer and i love it. But after the new update, we must online to use pixlr and it's full of ads.. Sorry i'll uninstall.. thanks to help my 5 years"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, no longer let's me use it unless I subscribe for an annual fee, it is also full off very annoying adds. I don't mind a few adds, but these are huge and extremely intrusive. Cuts off if there is no internet connection, I will be switching to photoshop until this stuff is fixed, it's slightly more complicated to use but is not broken"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved it for years. New owner has made it unusable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this about a year now and have loved it. Now if you're not connected to WiFi, you have to pay for the app with a subscription to use it, because no internet? Dumb. I hate this app now. Should not be considered free anymore. Wish I could give zero stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I'm having problem with the app while making collages. When I try to save them, it stops at 50% and doesn't save."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Force you to pay to use offline sad life"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Blured picture after editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I used to love the app. Been with it since 2015 or so. It greatly enhances my art photos. But after a update everything I once had [downloaded] I now have to pay to use!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Actually , not free, demands I stay online, register, share all my files (NOT just photos). I just want to crop photos offline. ""Paint"" will do!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cheesy"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome its the best photoshoper"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Great app but only giving 2 stars. I have been using for a long time, but new video ads are awful. Bummer. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to use it all the time, but now I think I'll move on. Constantly tells me I'm not connected to the internet when I am. I can understand having to pay for overlays, but ads when I just want to crop a picture? No thank you. Apparently paying the subscription doesn't even stop the ads!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Really is a great app with lotsa options"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Lately it had tons of ads...then just today, it requires me to subscribe for a fee."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The new update has rendered this app useless! Bombarded with ads and when you turn of the wifi to get rid of those annoying ads, it automatically closes the app prompting you to buy their premium subscription."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"You need an account, yucky"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I uninstalled this app after having been using it for years. I seldom have signal when I am editing photos on my tablet. The update that won't let me use it offline rendered it pretty much useless as a ""free app"". I understand the logic, but I think in the long run this will bring ratings down and lose users."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Dosent work well, will not let me delete, just keeps restarting my phone when I try to delete"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app, too many ads, some glitches"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ONLY works while connected to the internet! Done editing an image? Make sure you don't lose Wifi! Had over a dozen images lost because Pixlr will not let you continue use if Wifi is lost - sucks!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Vsn baje app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app has some cool features but the annoying, 30 second forced ads, in the middle of working on a picture, make it pretty worthless. I tried to ignore the ads but no app is worth this frustration."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've used pixlr for years now. It's always been very helpful, but after updating it I can say I've come across some problems with it. One of the problems that are really annoying me is when I'm working on an edit and suddenly it says the app is no longer working and I've lost all my work because of it. I've also had the problem where it deletes all my save work that I made on pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this is the best editing apps for me but The this app grow up head because you must Have to pay the subcription to use this app Sorry Im not good in english But DONT install this app it was wasting your time"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Before its offline but this time its online app very bad i use all time but this time he sbscribe options in app so i cannot use app very sameful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I just love it very helpful n good by touching it fantastic keep it 👆 🌹🙏"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, since 2015, and have loved everything about it, until this most recent update. Now, if you lose signal for whatever reason, pixlr will try to force you to subscribe to their paid service, and if you don't, their app will immediately boot you, regardless of whether or not you were in the middle of editing a photo. It has happened to me multiple times and I have lost so much progress. I hate it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a good app for quick little edits - now going to uninstall & go with something else as the length of ads to use this are totally unreasonable & better apps out there that have a pro-option. Bye Pixlr, was fun while it lasted ✌️."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to LOVE this app. I have used the free and paid versions. Due to the changes- intolerable ads, unease of use, offline use- I will not be purchasing the paid version, nor using the free version. Uninstalling an app that used to be a staple on my phone. I would consider coming back if improvements are made. Very unfortunate, this was once a really useful, creative tool."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads pop up and interrupt constantly and there are instances when one ad pops up, you close it and another immediately opens. This is way to interruptive. I used this app for like a year on my old phone, never updated the app now that i installed it on my new phone all i see is constant ads. I would understand if you get a pop up ad when you open the app and then banner ads while using the app, but this developers implementation is just trying to cash in and piss off existing users."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for yrs and have loooooved it since switching phones and reinstalling I HATE it I refuse to pay for this it's not worth it you just lost my support #uninstalling"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best app!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was using this app for years. Now with the offline upgrade thing, will not touch. It will delete all your hard work if your wifi goes out for half a second. It's not an app that ever received any improvements so I don't understand why they feel the need to aggressively start gaining money from it. Was a nice little app for making edits or memes, but useless now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a gem back in the days now its more of a ea clone. #Greedy corp."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Wow! I have loved this app for about 2 years and now it's completely unusable! A 15 second ad with EVERY step of an edit?!? I can't even save my work. I'll be looking for a new editing app in a few Hours when I finally complete a 10 minute project. So disappointed ☹️"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to pay and subscribe for offline use now? I've been using PIXLR for 6 years now, and now I have to pay for offline use?!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"NO OFFLINE ACCESS If given 3 words to describe this app I would use: bad. No other adjective can describe it better. Driving through the woods and your mobile data goes away? Say goodbye to the photo you're editing with a POPUP on your screen that closes the app. I've been a user of this app for years, told other people about it too (look, free advertising). Guess what, now you have an anti-advertiser! This is bull and not worth you time. Look for another app because there are plenty others!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads have been becoming annoying nowadays ... Loved this app before but today it's all about buying subscription and remove the ads"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"F*#& you... Forcefully asks for internet and plays unskippable ads. Annoying. Even after enabling internet it says connect to internet.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but it has gone exponentially down in quality this last year. Super disappointed honestly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"welp nice while it lasted but full screen 30sec ads aren't where I'm at"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Use to be my favorite, but I already paid to have the ad removed, a few years ago but now that I've changed phone I can't sign in anymore and I'm stuck with stupid ad."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"App exits when not connected to internet"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Love this app, best one. Used it for years. The only thing I wish it would let me do is scale images to a certain size (1:1 for example) instead of cutting pictures to a certain size like it actually does."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Hate the annoying video ads and I think the subscription price is ridiculous. I would do a one time purchase."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Love this app since I can use it offline but now after the update I have to pay to use it offline such a shame it was my go to editing app now I might search for another one"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"WHAT A SPLENDID APP IT IS!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest REQUIRES WIFI. WEAK. I dont use wifi so i'm onto the next thing... F. U. Pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Cant be more dissapointed. Been a loyal and old user of this app. Just tried opening after a long haul break. And what do I see...that I need to pay even to start editing. Thats trash. I used to suggest the app to others but I guess thats out of question now. The publishers and developers need to work it out."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It says free but ask you to monthly subscription, I used to like this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Its difficult to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Also have been using this app for years but these ads have got to be removed.. Why brake something that's not broken?"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Crashes every time i open a camera photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I absolutely love this app, but the new ad system renders the entire program unusable. The ads are relentless and incredibly annoying. I can understand the need for money to further the app, but this is insane. Not to mention the offline upgrade system. If my wifi goes out for a split second, the app will close or a pop-up will appear that deletes my edit."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I really amazing app that I have used for many years and really love. But I am with most people currently writing reviews; I would be happy to pay a one-off fee for the app, but I will not pay for a subscription. Looks like this will be the death of Pixlr. Whoever did their market research didn't do a very good job... Goodbye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"i used to love this app but now i can't edit offline."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"few days wonderful experience until ad. always popped up after a confirmed hard work and made all effort in vain. not sure if it's my device's compatibility (Samsung Note 9), but it seems that so many users as former review have same problem. Please have a announcement for trial or fix the bug. thank you"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Been my favorite photo editing app for years but now you just HAVE to be connected to internet to use it. That's ridiculous. I'm connected and still being treated as if I'm not, and being booted back to the start. The ads I can deal with but not that."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The best app becomes the worse app ever. Why everytime when i start the app i afto do some subscription?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this program, especially for adding watermarks to photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This use to be good app. Not anymore. I understand that creator of this app has to make money, but with new aggressive ads they are making me to dislike Pixkr. Uninstalled and moved to Adobe Photoshop Express"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for YEARS. I have no idea what happened but this app is now TRASH. Only giving me one option to edit a picture as ""default"" when before there was multiple different ways to edit the picture. This is extremely disappointing!!! I LOVED this app and used to tell my friends about it. Now its definitely not gonna be on any of my devices and I won't recommend it to anyone anymore 👎👎"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this for many years now. Definitely one of my favorite editing apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"before update pixlr was the best app BUT after new update, Pixlr is a very poor Worst app, without internet connection you can't access it, and now i've uninstalled this app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"THIS IS NOT A FREE APP. i have been using the app for years, but gonna uninstall it today because the app forced close itself by saying ""your device is offline. subscribe for offline pixlr"" when the wifi is on. so i guess this app is no longer free. bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"(-⭐) wish I could give negative stars or even just zero. This was the best photo editor that I've tried BUT Now the intrusive ads while editing are making it IMPOSSIBLE to use. I understand the need for ads sometimes but the way these are is TOO MUCH. Finding a new app for this now SUCKS"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trusted this app since many years and now they updated app with forced subcription. Time to move on."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exceptional quality and useability!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Would have given 4 maybe 5. But I have had this app over a year, maybe 2. And the last month I can't save a picture without watching a 50 secon ad. Stupid if you ask me. EDIT, after posting I decided to read other reviews and I see a pattern. EVERY one I read are complaining of the ads. Let's see how their customer service and appreciation is and see if they remove the stupid ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, does a lot and it is free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I used this app for the first time one year ago, and it's very useful and professional. You will have to deal with the adds, but in general I think this is an amazing tool for editing your photos, and the results are great."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The app is great for making great aesthetics and stuff. But pleeeeease give the option of an offset courser, it would make it so much easier to free hand things."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have had this app on the last 4 phones. (8 years +) After I got my current phone things have gone to hell. Something keeps popping up. I have no idea what it is. As the screen is jus black. Then it tells me right in the middle of working on something that I am offline & need to subscribe. Then when I do hit the subscribe button it kicks me out completely & I have to start all over. Only to have it happen again. Over & over. I've about had it. Not happy that I will be finding something new."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I can make my pictures POP. Fix colors, perhaps add my company logo. Great tool"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, but they made it awful because of the ads and the very fact you have to pay to activate offline feature. Who does that? Right. Nobody."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I love using the online version of Pixlr. It lets you get SUPER detailed, even being able to change a color to a color of your preference. But there is a SEVERE lack of features for this being practically the same app from the same creator on the mobile version. Whether or not its accessible thru the IAP, is very disappointing. I'm gonna stick with the online version. This app is a little bit basic and low-budget compared to the actual website."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"paide service not use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst evolution of Pixlr!! Usually when you update/upgrade apps, it is to make user-experience better. I have been using Pixlr for more than 10 years and had always loved it but then came the ads. Now it is a freaking nightmare. Sudden pop-ups to in the middle of your editing and bam! goes your hardwork without being able to save them. Time to say goodbye I guess."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app was really great I have been using this app almost year but then the updated and all of sudden all the style and fonts are gone and though app is not working as previously..now app need internet access and it sucks...very disappointed 😞👎"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Only gripes are purely with the aesthetics. The older version had a cleaner feel. Other than that, it's a decent editor if you're tight on space and/or can't be bothered to download ten adobe editors. Best used in conjunction with snapseed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I don't like this application. Now this application needs internet connection for editing pictures. In past it was not necessary but now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Downloading edited collage pictures is very veryy sloooow to download."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, repeatedly tells me to connect to the internet even though it's connected."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"AD INTRUSIVE - My old standby photo-editing app, Pixlr, is no longer useable. The company that bought the rights to Pixlr from AutoDesk has decided that the free version of their app will now contain 30-second-long full-page ads at frequent intervals. The alternative is to sign up for a yearly subscription at $14.99. It is finally time to say goodbye to one of my favorite apps. Uninstalling."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for like 7 years, my favorite app ever for editing my pics. Has always been free, then recently they started adding ads that interrupt your editing constantly. Then today it asked me to buy the app. When I clicked ""no"" it took me out completely.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This has been my go to photo editing app since it first came out and it has always been amazing have had some in app purchases over the years but have been happy. The updates and adds have made it unusable. It also now often says connect to the internet even if you are already connected, just a way to try to make you purchase the subscription as it says full use is available off line. sad to see this one go but will uninstall and try Snapseed. Bye bye Pixlr is been great while it lasted."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrble! You can only edit one picture! And i made me spend my money ehen i pressed X! WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Well....they got Gawddam greedy. Too bad....used to be an amazing app....now they can piss up a flag pole for all I care"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The adds and hoops you have to jump thru are a joke now, uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I recommend you download a previous version and disable auto updates, because now the ads won't let you use it properly and no, you can't use it offline."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happen to offline free use you cannot use it anymore without a data or wifi connection such so dissapointment were gonna purchase now the application to use the offline mode, then this was great application but now so horrible money making application recommended not to download this app anymore they gonna make us atm card"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Even with free mode...... it's totally awesome.....mind blowing filters and other features"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and I've recommended it as a staple for photo editing to all my friends for it's reliability. (I didn't mind the minor ads) but with the absurd amount of ads there are now, I'm going to have to let it go. Pixlr is dead. RIP."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why, why the ads. Because of the ads of your subscription, I lost all of my progress on a photo I was editing. It sent me back to the home screen, unless you fix these ads, 1 star."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Because we have to pay for just overlays that easily i can make on lightroom or you are comparing youself with lightroom?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app. Using it for 7 years. All of sudden you are asking to pay. No thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"It's kinda boring but I think it can be improved"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app as far as I remember I'm using this app since it got launched n I'm so happy with it.. but I feel you guys need to add some more tools such as mirroring, reflection & png effect..!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So sad. I used this app for years and now I have to sit through multiple ads while working on a photo. I would pay to buy it, but I am not going to pay a subscription fee."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The ads are extremely intrusive and annoying. It's basically useless to me. I can't stand to use it and I won't reward the autodesk for this type of behavior. There are free aps without ads that work better than this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Used it for a while since it was simple but now it's borderline unusable. Too many ads, constantly crashes and doesn't save the pictures properly 1 out of 3 times."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"my favorite app ♥️, it let you explore your creativity with photos and user interface is really super friendly. I wish there was some more fonts in the category of handwritten. I love using pixlr. Thank you so much for making this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I give one star after this update all the applied stickers borders and overlay is now need to pay .... if there is a reset for update i will reset my update back to my older version... now i need down new app for editing photos ... searching again ... (greed)"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I should have NEVER installed the update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"OSm App😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Like many, used it for years. Increasingly annoying ads as others have mentioned, but with the new requirements, I guess it's just time for us to break up. Sorry, Pixlr: it's not me - it's you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As of 6/20/20 all this app does is create ads, waste of time."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Absolutely a beautiful application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a fantastic program. Has progressively been getting worse. Over time it became less intuitive with updates. Now it is subscription bassed. Don't even waste your time, no option to buy outright. Find something else, or download an old version. That's what I'm going to do. Sad really, was such a good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Horrible for collages, which is about the only thing I wanted it for. You can not put the whole picture in the frames - even if you adjust the frames to a matching shape, this app still crops it down to a small portion of the middle (manual cropping won't override that). Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst china"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's so boring, there's none of the fun options like liquify or cutout. Why does pixlr x and pixlr e (which only work on computers!!!) have all the funny stuff, but us phone users can't. It's stupid and boring!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Fake free app: it immediately asks you to pay for subscription after download and won't work otherwise."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saving is not successful.. Many Times tried to save the image after edit but it keeps on loading for hours. Fix that"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"great app...use it all the time for cropping images and for creating custom memes and to save images and to edit them...to frame or age an image! JUST DOWNLOAD IT and see for yourself!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"You'll have to pay them to use this app. Not recommended, I'm also uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Waste"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice app... Plz include some artistic filters..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest update disabled offline mode and is basically useless now. Do not update."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I love this app, it is my edit app that helps me edit pictures that I and other people want me to edit for them but now I can't really edit anymore due to me having to re-downloading the things I use to edit. And I can't do that because of it keeps on saying ""Error"", I do have space and I do have a good internet connection."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Disappointed!! This used to be my favorite photo editing app. Now it just tells me to subscribe and if im not buying i cant use it. So i dont use this now. Hungry of money?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Sayem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now you need a subscription to use the app. What a terrible decision to make after years of being my go to app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What happened?! I have been using this app for about 3 years and it was always my favorite as it was what I considered the BEST of the free! NOW!!! Ads?!?!?! Before I can save my work?! This was NEVER a thing! And all the ""FREE"" filters and stickers etc I once had are now gone and to get them back I HAVE TO PAY?!?!? Why ruin such a good thing! I unfortunately will now be searching for something else...such a shame 😞"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ghatiya app..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So when did you guys feel the need to get greedy all of a sudden? I've used this app for years and now I need to pay to use it offline? No thanks. And even when I'm connected to the internet I still can't use it. Until you fix this issue I'm afraid I'm gonna have to uninstall this app (plus, there are honestly better photo editors out there)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years without any problems, but when I tried using it today it wouldn't let me edit anything even with my internet connected. Guess I'll find something else."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have been using Pixlr for maybe 8 years or so. The Pixlr folder on my phone is where I store my best pictures and that I consult on a daily basis. Unfortunately, the aggressive ads and latest requirements are pushing me to reluctantly part ways. Saddened, but I cannot support this approach."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Nice not bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's my favorite app for years! So much memories it helped me with, but recently it said I can't use it coz I'm not connected to internet, i enabled my internet and well guess what, it just always brings me to the home page everytime I use a tool. 💔💔 Guess I need to move on from you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New update ...too much add Its disturbing while editing the image."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive ads and requires a network connection to use a photo editing app? Lol what"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I'm using Pixlr from 5 years . now offline not support with lot of add. shortly I will uninstall"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app over a 8 year's. Currently with premium membership. Nice done team. I hope for new filters and stickers."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Mentioning free photoeditor but asking for money. I have used the app for years and now it's like you people are begging for money."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Trashed the app with IAP's. All the things you're asking money for used to be free. Edit - IT'S GOTTEN WORSE"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used multiple photo editing apps, but this one doesn't compare. I downloaded an editing app not too long ago and deleted it to download one I can trust, ""Pixlr- Free Photo Editor"" If your new to photo editing, then this app is for you. The controls are easy and the app itself is well put together. They have everything you need. I trust this app and I have downloaded it countless of times."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Updates just keep getting worse, doesn't feel like the developers test their new features (the mosaic tool has an icon that pops up above to show a magnified view of where you're drawing, your finger reaches the end of the screen but the drawing path is still an inch away from the corner. What's up with that? Such a shame cause this used to be my favourite app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Pixlr used to be an excellent app...it still has many great features, but so many apps have made it terrible. And it can't be fully used without an internet connection, which is unfair. No longer deserves a 5-star, sorry."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I like most, easy to use...."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Had this app since it came out on all different devices because this app used to be amazing! Current day however, pictures come out horrible when I hit ""done"" (very 8 bit looking/blurry).. not worth spending money on! Ads make it unbearable too.. either remove the 30 second ads or just make the app a purchase app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As a photo editor it fails within seconds, without real-time feedback it is useless and worthless - you gotta be able to see how what you are doing affect the image in as close to real-time as possible."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Had used this app before"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"After updated I uninstalled cause irritation But older version was good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Main app i use to edit photos on my phone. It is really simple self explanitory tool to edit photos. I use another app to remove backgrounds but other than that i can put my photo together all in this app. Has nice filters and frames and overlays. Seems to have a bug where the bottom of the screen will disapear while editing certain things. Its the part that has a slider for transparency and a check mark to finish edit. I will just guess where the check is and finish edit save and reload. So np"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not a good app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good working"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No go"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for YEARS to do quick picture edits and have recommended it to many people. It's a fantastic mobile image editor. Recently the ads had become more intrusive, which I tolerated, but when I opened it today it told me I needed a subscription to use the app online and wouldn't let me in despite the fact I was connected to the internet. I'd have happily bought a paid version of the app to support the developers, but I'm not paying a subscription. Guess I'll find another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank pixlr"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wrost."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Same as the others here. This has been my main app for years. I've done shows and sold photos it's that good. Shame, to give up so many faithful users by making such odd changes. Uninstalled."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for at least 3 or 4 years until this week they started blocking sections of the app and forcing you to subscribe for a monthly fee! Who do you think you are, Netflix? It's a photo editing app, don't be greedy! I would pay a ""one of"" purchase, but a monthly subscription it's ridiculous. What a shame after all this years.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use Google's own pixel slate Chromebook and when installing this trying to open it crashes on everything and does not work at all even though it's listed in the apps that are featured for Chromebooks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app, I used it to edit my pics or play around with photos, not a professional, just for me, but all out of the blue you started pushing long ads, and now I cannot even use the app unless I subscribe and pay to use it, was not the greatest app but it was pretty good. Now asking for monthly payments this way, not cool... Unfortunately, going to uninstall and find another app to edit."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fantastic app. Not anymore thanks to their recent ads (video for a full 30 seconds that you can't even close out of when they're done)that make this unusable. The ads pop up multiple times (and randomly), even if you're just switching from one paint brush to another. No thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It shut down the phone and drain my battery. Some fuctions doesn't work properly."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for long. Now it shows ads in between edits, a very disgusting experience. Either you go fully paid or go free. Very disappointing experience. Uninstalled it. Let there be a hollow star rating for such apps."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app for editing pics such as blurring, lightening and darkening. Stickers could use an update but I love love the editing features."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Does anyone know how to change font?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Intrusive, 30-second ads have ruined what was once an essential photo editor."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Free no more after the updates. Unavailable to use at all. Nevertheless thank you for the before version which useable."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Deleted the app and will now find other apps to use."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Since last update pixlar covers all photos I try to edit with 30 second ads for useless trash I'll never use. Too bad one more good app is now worthless. Less than zero"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly as described. Heavy ads but the app works and it's free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"i like this is app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"♥luv it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"GREAT"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I recommend u use the website not app the app is way different and there is barely any tools."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great Application 👍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good and very bad!!!! Today I realized you guys placed 30 second ads in between saving the photos! This is a huge mistake!! Now I will uninstall your app!!!! Way to go guys if I were you I'd be firing some of your employees!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I ever seen this awesome app in my life This app is very amazing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Same as all other comments. Great app that gave good tools for what it is. But now to subscribe. Definitely not worth the money."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Okay! Guys if you have'nt download this Yet Trust me this is So Great! Acctualy Just if you Rly need it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STAR. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!! I loved this app since 2014 but now it turned into trash!!!!!! You can't use it offline anymore unless you'll pay for it!!!!!!! The huge selection of fonts, borders, effects and filters are now FOR SALE!!!!! You won't get too far this way, I'm telling you."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"one of my favorites 😍 Thank you 💖"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,",I can't use it anymore, always requires internet connection, bad update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. It worked great and the ads were only small banner ones across the bottom or in the background of the saving screen. Recently, intrusive full-screen ads have been added and they're very annoying, and the fact that I suddenly can't edit photos without internet is shady - it's clearly just make sure they can push ads onto us. I'm now sadly uninstalling this app after a couple years of loving it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but ads have become absolutely ridiculous. They are 30 seconds long and pop up mid edit. I tried to edit 1 photo and seriously had to endure 3 ads, each 30 seconds long, just to crop a photo?!?! Would have actually paid for this app but apparently it doesn't stop the horrendous ads either. Total bummer!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Troubleshooting each time saving photos from collage.. Too bad"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Not that easy to use and tons of ads."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app was amazing. Now there are so many ads!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice play 100 persent good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app update made me very very unhappy. This app was one the best editing app. And now they are asking for subscriptions. The app was free and very easy to use, with good features, now I cant use this app at all. Very unhappy. Sorry to say, guys dont update this app. The previous version was too good. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"ଟିକେ ଲାଳନଙ୍କସ୍ 🤤 ରହୁଛି"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be good but is now more ads than app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good and very nice app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Old pixlr app was better to this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Normally is my ""go to"" Editor. Just one feature would make it get a whole lot more stars is if you could resize images to fit collage boxes. You seem to be able to enlarge, but not to reduce."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using this App for years! My last review was dated 2013. Now it forces ads and no offline use? Seriously? Bye!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have experience New downloading now"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good Experience this app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was my fav app, has become a cash grab, now ill look for other app, bye guys"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ruined All the free features now have to be purchased What happened to the freedom? Wow 🏃"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have loved this app for years. Today I can not even use. I load a picture and it is forcing me to pay a subscription. Change the name from 'Free Photo Editor' as it no longer is."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of a kind professional application"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"this app very good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Great app for editing photos. Too many adds! It's really frustrating!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app...when it was owned by another group. Now it's got like one good thing and I can see myself keeping it just for one part"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It helped me a lot"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"خیلی خوبه ولی کاش امکان کارتونی کردن عکس هم بهش اضافه میشد"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Semua okayy... apps okay, edit okay,, gmbr okay,, tools okay, mak okay, ayah okay, bos okayy, adik okay, abg okayy,,kakak okayy, kawan okay, member okay, gang okayy,, yg tak okay aku je... takpernahh nk okay🤘😔"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Paid £1.61 on Sept 13th 2016 to have ads removed, and all of a sudden I can't restore my purchase, and have to look at stoopid-arse ads. After contacting their dev, my purchase was restored, and the ads are gone, so changing review from 1 back to 5 stars!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I'm using this application since 2015, but now application can't install any of font packs. Please fix this problem soon as possible. This is a awesome application for photo editing and collage making.!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since it launched virtually. This app is great and I decided to subscribe and pay for the app since ads became this horrendous thing like a virus within the app. I am still getting ads although I have paid. I will not adjust this rating until this issue is resolved. It's a great app, I'm a loyal guy, I expect that when I pay for no apps, I will not have my work flow interrupted by ads continuously. Please contact me if needed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Unable to edit pics now, needs to pay."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Latest version is now unusable. Uninstalled this now."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app has gone down the drain due to its new agressive ad policy! Have a nice time .... App deleted now!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"""Free"" is a blatant lie after this newest update. Our entire family used this app but we will find another one that lives up to its claims."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What used to be a decent editing app completely ruined in a single update."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Thanks for ruining a perfectly good app. I dont mind sitting through ads for something free but requiring a subscription makes the ""free"" part A LIE."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be food, but not now. If there was an option for no stars, that is what it would deserve after this update that requires a subscription to use a supposedly free service."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Have used them for a long time and would previously have given a 5 star rating. Now suddenly I need a subscription? Terrible. It says ""no account required"" in the description, but won't allow me to continue without one."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app until they got greedy and put more ads in. Don't even mind the ads, but when I'm out of the house and there's no internet, but the app stops working. It never used to need internet to work, but the ads don't work offline so the app now breaks offline."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good. But where is the feature to overlay images over one another specifically. Like right now i can only overlay it to the corner. Why cant i chose where to overlay it? I would love to see this in a future update"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There is no sticker in this app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Best photo editor but difficult"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"n0 No nO no NO!! ADS?!! WHY!? Why ads?! I have used and LOVED this app for MANY years but now I'm considering uninstalling this app. I will not use any app that has pop up ads that hold you hostage for up to 30Secs and ads that pop up with every other touch. I understand ads are what provide free apps installs, but when they constantly interrupt you, its not worth it. The ads that are now present are annoying buy not overbearing....yet... Plz don't get greedy and ruin the editing experience."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Pixlr has been inserting 30 second ads that pop up just after I tap ""Done"" and before I can Save the graphic. UNACCEPTABLE. If it continues I will uninstall."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"The best and easy photo editor I've ever used! Thanks!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was a wonderful app, now it doesn't load photos... What happened to this app?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the world's most useless photo editing app😠🤬"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"AWESOME app !!! hope they have it for iphone"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing photo editing app with a pretty reasonable ammount of ads that I have actually recommended to friends, but now every update seems to be restricting more and more features behind a paywall. Not the same Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I used to use this app so much! Don't do edits that much now, but starting with this one was great. Don't know how it is now but it still has a special place in my heart."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wow, I've been using this app very often for years as my number one go to photo editing app and now I have to have an active subscription and pay money to use it? You guys really suck. Uninstalling for the foreseeable future."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. Works 4 me. Use it 4 clients to show B4 & After Works."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid a one time fee to have ads removed and after taking the money they change the payment model saying it's now subscription based. What about the one time fee paid for ad removal?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"What does this do that literally any other photo app on your phone doesn't already do? Nothing except ads to pay these guys."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Now full screen video ads you can't skip"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"One of the best photo editing app in Google play store"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"When did Pixlr start showing pop up ads? I respect that this app has to make money somehow but jeez it's turning me off from it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"As has been mentioned, this app WAS amazing but with recently added update that apparently triggers a pop up ad with every function you try to use, i will be uninstalling the app as im sure many more will as well."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Imagine downloading this app and it takes so long because your internet is slow and upon using it, you find out it requires an internet connection, which you have. But your connection is slow and this app thinks you're not online even though you are."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be rly good but now its garbage"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So many adds. Wooowwwwww like a bomb ads"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Two months ago, I would've given this 4 stars. But now I can barely give 2 stars. Whenever I use t/ DOUBLE EXPLOSURE option, the text is blurred & unreadable, even when the original post is fine. When I use the TEXT option, Cut & Paste and/or Type... the final product is always blurred & not fit to post. I've restarted my Android phone, and deleted & reloaded the app. None of this worked. I've encountered issues w/ the blurring before, but now it's everytime I use the App."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Lost 4 stars. I cant use without a subscription yet can use offline? Free my butt used to not force close without a account or subscription."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Decent app, but it shows intrusive ads which actually ruins the experience. It wasn't this bad before."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This is best editer"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Have to add more features."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great features!! My go-to editing program. 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Paid to remove ads, getting ads again. If I'm going to pay a subscription fee for a basic ass photoshop, might as well get the real thing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"9:6:20 all please uninstall this latest version. find and download version 3.4.24 from Google. Turn off internet connection and enjoy like before. 5:9:19 Can't open it. Crashing down every time when i want to open this."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is nice but iam having the problem in downloding effects & fillter plez slove this my problem"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Screenshot Editing SUCKS!! Its super low resolution and when i share on Facebook messenger text is unreadable, photos look like 1 megapixel even though im using a note 9... I dont have any issues with resolution in Lightroom mobile. Only pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can not use as usual after updating. App stop and need to restart the smartphone June 09, 2020 30 sec advertising is too long, so boring and reflect bad impression to the product owner."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for years! Then today all of the sudden it won't let me edit pictures without paying for a subscription!! Every time I open it. It says FREE but apparently now you have to pay for it monthly in order to use. Very disappointed. Have uninstalled it now. So long... Guess Snapseed will be my go to from now on."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"😄"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Was a great app for years, now ruined by greed, look elsewhere"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Newly-introduced 30 second video advertisements. F. T. S."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Worst app of no use. Many times it gets hanged. Some times it doesn't save photos . #Avoid Chinese Product"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"So F***ing annoying how suddenly this app has pop-up ads every time you try to tap a button... also this used to be a totally free app, until recently when the app designers started only putting out new overlays that cost money. VERY disappointing after using this app for years. Done with it. It has now reached the status of soooo many others, ""trash""👌😒 would give zero stars if it was an option."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"First edit since 2016. Wow. One of my favourite apps turned into subscription nonsense. Goodbye 👋"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent application for photo editing and color grading."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"I dont have this"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not bad i mean it works and its hreat for some photos so maybe"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Exclent"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I use to like this app a lot before the update all of a sudden it has turned into a trash because now I cannot move the text wherever I want to.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't use it offline. Bad app. Used to be good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very smooth, useful and easy app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Not That Good Can't Save It But Pretty Good Photo Editor Make It Save And A Crop Option And A Remove Option Would Be Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am highly disappointed, I've been using this app for over 5 years for free to edit my photo for my media purposes only to open the app to go edit some photos to be continuously spammed with ads ever 15 seconds when not using a tool, then later to have a MUST subscription box pop up to get rid of the ads and for me to continue using the app for $14.99 a month!? And if you choose to press the ""X"" the app doesn't let you continue and closes itself...I'm quite upset and hope this can be resolved."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to be great, ruined like 99% of all the other apps. Will be removing from my phone."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"I've been using this for years, even after they added the obnoxious ads. Right up until recently when this app became subscription only. I just don't understand why they would put a price on something when they have competitors with much better products that offer theirs for free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"30 second add wall after editing each picture I think not. Removed, I'll use another app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"WOW... IVE BEEN USING THIS APP FOR YEARS I MEAN YEARS EVERYDAY.. ALL OF A SUDDEN IM FORCED TO PAY IF I WANNA CONTINUE ... AND TO MAKE IT WORSE ITS A DAMN SUB.. WOW SAD.. JUST SAD... THIS IS WHY YOULL EVENTUALLY LOSE RESPECT AND USERS... THIS IS DISQUSTING❗❗❗❗"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used it for years. Now i can't use a feature because it's buried in ads... subscriptions are a no-go. Bye"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"This app has a glitch in the gallery. I use the older Android gallery app. It creates an entire directory of random pictures when I use it. Then I need to delete them. It's super annoying."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"New, full screen, 30 second ads. I'll find an alternative."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"OK, giving them another chance. Still a good app. The annual subscription is reasonable if you use the app frequently. ----- I used to love this app. Used it multiple times a day. Even paid to remove the ads. But now, they want me to pay for every page of filters & overlays - ones that used to be free."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Was a pixlr user for years. Uninstalled due to recent update. Ads constantly pop up during use locking the app and requiring the user to watch 30 second ads rendering the app useless for what i used it for : quick photo editing. Unfortunately I had to Switch to something easier to use. Thanks for the prior years."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be the best app on the market imo. I recommended it to everyone for years. Now it is complete garbage. There are so many ads you can't do anything. 30 seconds of ads every 10 seconds! Don't bother with this trash app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This is the furthest thing from free. Once you select your photos you immediately have to purchase a subscription. Had this for quite a few years but now looking for an alternative."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I use this app for more than I expected. Most of the time I use it to mildly improve pics. It's a keeper. But I find the doodle feature difficult to use neatly. I feel like I can never make clean lines and the size isn't small enough. Sometimes I want to cleanly write a word on an image but it feels like I'm doing it with a spray can of paint. Unfortunately, I give up a lot."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"First thing I saw in the app is ad. Ignored and clicked next , then another ad for 30 sec. So uninstalled. Thanks for the wonderful ad experience 😊"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"All the filters have stopped working. What went wrong with you??"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Been using for a while & not looked for another. ▪️Great amount of options that are free ▪️ ads are not invasive/in your face ▪️basically easy once you've play with it ▪️wish it had undo(s) ▪️issue/glitch... hit done & view in folder so you can copy or move it to galary & you can't go back to window cause you click & it freaks out/goes away, still open but can't access it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Annoying adds"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love it I have been able to make some many cool new pictures for me and my friends"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was great until last update. Now everytime I open it is asking for subscription, very disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"useless app, can't work offline..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ads ADS ADS DISGUSTING 🤢 i unstall it its never good anyway 👋"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"this has been my GO TO photo editor for YEARS. something happened... something bad. the workability is the same, great editing capabilities. but the ADS!.. and the ads load while I'm saving edits, half the time it doesn't save my work and saves the original. this will be the 1st time that I can remember, that THIS APP will not be on ANY of my devces. I'm really bummed about that. thanks."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Create a pollen all some of the filters might be a little too much but I do like the tools at that they have given you an order to I'll see your pictures and whichever way you desire"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"App is great til i can't use it anymore, even the basic editing, unless i subscribe. Sad!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This app is unusable now. It won't take me to the page to save anything. It goes back to the work page every time when you close the advertisement. Anytime you try to save it only plays an advertisement but doesn't allow you to save your work. I lost a lot of effort this morning because I couldn't save it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Saves photos in low quality, used to be completely free, not worth paying for. After a few years of use, it's downgraded immensely, will be uninstalling and looking elsewhere."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great! 😍"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"nice apk"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite go to app, largely because of its exceptionally easy to use double exposure feature and the ability to use offline without being inundated with ads. It is now no longer a usable app for me."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"No offline ruined the app. It was fine otherwise. I'd prefer a straight purchase over a subscription but I guess that offer is out of the table."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Not able to edit even one picture also. It's asking for internet connection previously it was awesome now it's asking repeatly internet, could have add skip option"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Wont even let me complete a collage with trying to push me to subscribe all after one update.UNISTALLED!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is best app for pics editing"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very useful!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Whoa, the adds are terrible now! 😠"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Found my collage feature."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Use to love this app but it fell off a cliff after their moneygrubbing update. When you lose internet connection for a split second a notication pops up saying you must pay for the full version to use the app offline. When you decline to do this, the app closes and you lose all your unsaved work. I'm going to be deleting Pixlr and looking for an alternative. Thanks for a good few years ✌✌"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Bal"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This App sucks now they have added way to many adds"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"曾经不错"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Would love to be able to crop or resize to larger than the original image, with a chosen background colour"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Tools » Heal » Spot Last time I use this option to remove black mark or pimple marks from the face. Now this option not functioning very well. I guess there is error on it. The photo pixel broke after picture editing. Hope can see some update on it. Thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The app is not that good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I love this editer it is the best i have ever used!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"SimplyLove it,,, very easy to editing.."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Happy with this app.. Need some texts effects"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"My once ""Go to"" app for pic editing is now a Zero Stars kinda deal. Wow, you guys sure know how to completely ruin User Experience. The ads went from being tolerable to ridiculously obnoxious in one update. The app is barely usable, barely. And, here's a kicker, the ads don't even work! Furthermore, your only hope of removing them is... a subscription?! Major nosedive. I've been a major fan for over 2 years, I've even bought little extras here and there. I am bitterly disappointed."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is my favorite app in my life because it helps to school to take better photos."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Suddenly riddled with obnoxious and repetitive ads that make the product unusable. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I am not happy about ur last update which u cant uninstall.. it use to be great now u have ads popping up.. totally not kool..!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Been using this app since 2013.... Still one of the coolest."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome for editing pictures"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, but now there are ads every few seconds. When I turned the wifi off to get rid of them, it deleted my picture! Come on guys. What the heck?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use 5 stars ♡♡♡♡♡"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Nice app but ads irritates a lot"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's OK but it won't let me Add layers"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Chinese so1 star Uninstalling"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"For not letting us use it in offline mode I always use it and today I couldn't please fix it and I'll give 5 stars"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Brilliant❤❤❤"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very Good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"Ads are becoming annoying. Saving is slow. Love the app but if this continues will uninstall. Great overall but if ads every 15 seconds and a slowing app is what the free version is going towards....well it's been fun."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Excellent ...!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Why this app requires permission to my physical activity? Answer me then I'll update my review."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Loved the app before the intrusive ads that take over the entire screen. I don't mind ads and I want you guys to make money, but I can't wait on finishing my tasks to watch your ads. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Love this app still I've gotten rid of it to them download it again when I'm board and want to play with my artistic ideas for photos lol I love this so needless to say so now it stays!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This was a very good beginner app, the tools were easy to find and to use. The app doesn't really make the photos clearer, but the effects it uses are really cool. The fonts in this app are much better than the gallery or photoshop on your phone or tablet. I would recommend using photoshop first, then if you want text edit the edited version in Pixlr."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Too many ads. Didn't used to be this many ads. I miss 12 hours ago when there weren't so many ads. Uninstalling."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years and years. My only complaint would be the new filters. I'd like to use them without having to buy them. Like have some kind of way you could earn them by watching ads or sharing content. Something like that. Other wise its perfect!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Used to be great until last update. Now there are SO many ads it's completely unusable. Ads pop up every 30 seconds and I'm required to watch the same 25 second ad EVERY time before I can save my edits?! I don't think so. You got too greedy. Buh bye."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"شكيل في شكيل لا ينفع في شيء 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😠😠😠😠😠"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"It is very easy and convenient to use"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"عالی"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Not used"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Good."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Excellent features. I am giving 5 star but have some suggestions. The sliders are not real-time, that is, I can't view changes while I am sliding, but only when I release the slider. Also, since instagram has a picture resolution of 4:5, you could add it to the crop ratios. Thank you for this beautiful app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Ugh u have to delete somwthing to get it WOW"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Fairly good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Have used this for free for over 6 years now and is still my go-to photo editing app. Big thanks to those who created it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,".. Very good app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Its good.but lacks some of the editing tools as do most on Google play"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It's not like the video at all"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Ok for basic editing but fails terribly with collage. It is the size problem with this app. You can make smaller but impossible to make larger in many occasions. Meaning add collage of 4 text screenshots and you end up having something utterly weird. I prefer full amount of pixels *at first* and then reducing later. Prefer having full content instead of letters on the middle. Did something like this app around 1987 with X10. Seems like quite stagnated world.... (my draw util was better)."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Tells me I need to turn on my WiFi even tho I have my WiFi on just forces you to pay after a few uses"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"cool app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"If you're finding a Photo editing free app, then this is not for you. Have been using this app for weeks and I am really loving it! There are good few equipments and tools, however to my great disappointment, I am fooled that it wasn't free. They've sent me a notification on ""subscribing"" only for you to be given few days of another free trial and if you wanted to continue using it's equipments and tools, you'll need to pay it. Sorry but I don't buy it. Very disappointing."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Its too good"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Can't work in offline after update please work on it pixlr or else I have to uninstall and replace with another app ! Make it like before how it use to be ......."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Love It"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.Highly recommended. Go for it. Thanks team for creating this great app."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"Free version opened image quality (dpi\ppi not pixel resolution) is downconverted to 25%~50%. That is why crops, heals, zooms, etc look terrible... in the free version. It is what it is."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Serves my need very well, even opened broader views. The light control features are very reliable. Thank you."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very easy and professional app thanks"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I gave this 5 stars but now I hate it."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It's a great app with lots of options. I typically have a great experience using it, but now the adverts pop up when I'm in the middle of editing an image. Profoundly annoying!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It used to work perfectly but now I can't even download the additional filters /overlays, stickers and fonts. I tap on it but nothing happens. Why is that? Sometimes, half of the lower bar that appears when editing disappears and I have to restart the app to remove it. Also, it's been years now and you still don't have the option to save your image as different images types such as PNG, unlike the website counterpart, where you can choose the image type and quality.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It was a very good app a year ago. Features are still good. Of late hangs during saving plus there's a lot more irrelevant ads. After spending so much time on editing image if u r not able to save the work coz the app hangs then it leads to super frustration.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Best app"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for about 5 years for my cosplay Instagram editing. The update completely ruined it. Some of my favorite borders and fonts are behind a paywall, which isn't even a one-time thing. I'm not even angry, I'm just very, very disappointed. I've been a loyal user for 5 years, and now I'm going to have to learn a new editing app. I was so happy to have an editing app that didn't have limited features and I recommended Pixlr to a lot of people. Completely unfair and garbage."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app..use alot!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I had wrongly given this app 1 star rating bcoz it shrunk high resolution pictures after editing. The problem was with my non-rooted phone. After I rooted the phone and added a custom ROM, this app is awesome. I can now edit ultra HD 8960*6580 resolution pictures and still get the same resolution after editing. No more shrinking of picture quality. Pixlr is the best. Period"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"How to create a double exposure?? But i like it"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Considering this is an app for mobile devices it does a pretty decent job of improving images. It would be nice if sharpness, texture and clarity were within the conventional adjustments menu as oppose to their own, but for a mobile app this does an excellent job. Used a few over the years, and this stands out above the rest. I use PSP from Adobe on my computers, and I would be tempted to use this if it could manage RAW files and used RAW filters, could stack images..I'm an astro photographer."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"I can't change the font"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Very best app"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"This photo editor is the worst on the app market. There is NO SIZE OPTIONS for fonts and you cant manipulate the text such as bolding. If the wording is long, it just runs off the picture! This used to work nicely but.... delete! Different app!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Wonder ful"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"The App is ok, but it could be so much better if we didn't have to re-download the same effects EVERYTIME we update the app. They don't require much data BUT they add up everytime when we have re-download them EVERYTIME after every app update.

It never gets boring. You'll find the right customization regardless."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Extraordinary app for photo editing. I am sure they are working for new features like cuting edge editing ..."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Thank you very much."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"It is a really good app, but the only thing I don't like is the picture itself is really low quality."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"The first thing it asks you to do is agree to a EULA. But the link to the EULA is broken, so you're being asked to sign something you can't read. Totally unacceptable and almost certainly illegal under GDPR. Uninstalled immediately."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"There's no way to save edited photo."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"I am using this app from 2015. it's lovely"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"The one function I was looking for.. smoothing.. the smoothing isnt good. And thats just one important function that a photo editor shall have. And in a good quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Once you try to give it access the SD card the card disappears from the phone. File managers and other apps can no longer ""see"" the card. Only thing that fixes it is a reboot. Minor update fixed it completely. Am back to loving Pixler."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good."

Idk if this is something I'm doing wrong but none of the other apps I've used have this problem. This has occurred on multiple devices and I had to stop using it.

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"This is probably the only photo app i honestly find useful. Ive tried many but this one has everything i need from filters, effects, stickers, borders and more. Id done 4 and half if i were able though bc the one complaint i have is there is nothing new added often and when there is they cost money. Others than that this is a great app."

I AM BEYOND UP SET! HELP ME, PLEASE???!!!!!!!!!"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It has gotten to the point where this app is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. It takes FOREVER to load in photos from your gallery. I know it's not the phone causing the problem, 6 GB of Ram here, but for info purposes, Galaxy Note 8."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app overall. I've been using it for a couple years and it has everything I need for editing photos on the go. Touching up colours, brightness, contrast, and other effects and filters feel more more intuitive and sensible on the app than the website. My only request is that there be more options for the layer effects, such as changing the size and specific location to apply them."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",4,"Good quality"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"Image quality reduces to low even when saved at best resolution, after editing."

I've used the ""restore purchase"" option in the settings menu many times but ads still pop up. Can the developers advise?"
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",2,"well, i discovered pixlr by its website photo editor, and i think it's so much better than this version, if you could do it the same as the website editor, this would be 5 stars."
"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",1,"It used to work great on my old phone but since I've gotten a new phone the app doesn't work that well. It often doesn't save my pictures when I'm done editing. Sometimes it starts saving but doesn't complete the process and no file is saved, and other times when I press ""done"" and want to save it it just undos all my edits and reverts to the original. I used to be able to click ""done"" and chose to save the file or share it in another app, this function also no longer appears!"

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",5,"Great app. Was looking for a quick replacement for Photoshop and found my self over the past few months constantly headed to this app instead. Very 'filter' based when it comes to customizations or manipulations but these days.. a lot of photo edits are capturing realism with few color enhancements. Love the duplicate layers option. In the future, I would like to see more control over the layers. That would nearly knock me away from Photoshop all together."

"Pixlr AI Art Photo Editor","Unknown",3,"ixlr is great Absolutely The most irritating thing I've come across these last 2 updates is that i can't see all changed as they are! ie: Writing text is fine but i can't see the level of fade i set it at, while the app is open i only get the option to see the text 100% or 0% No in between. That goes for color changing as well, i will work hard on a piece and i think its perfect! After i save it i check my photo folder and the pictures colors are not as the app showed me.
