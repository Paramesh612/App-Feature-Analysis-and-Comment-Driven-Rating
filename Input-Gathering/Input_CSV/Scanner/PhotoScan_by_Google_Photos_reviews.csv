Granted, there's an auto-save but if you want another copy, you can't simply save it to device with a click. Document also exports with a version that has a border advertising the app. Wish there was a way to turn that off."

Before throwing them all away, I wanted a cheap, quick and simple way of digitising them. PhotoScan meets my needs. Place the photo on a sheet of white paper, frame the image and take the photo. The app crops the image and rotates. In most cases the resulting image is great for my needs. I do t use the flash and 4 image method."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Nice concept but poorly executed. The results get quite low resolution despite the camera being high res. Useless for me."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Okay so far. Would be great if I can organize my scans by folders. I've also noticed recently that it's starting to capture some shadows. Example, if the picture (or whatever) I'm scanning is on a table, I have a light source from the ceiling, my hand would hover over the thing I'm scanning and cast a shadow. Even if the flash is turned on, it still casts a shadow. Please fix."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Excellent for photo album pictures. If you need the best conversion of physical photos to digital, use a flatbed scanner. But if your photos cannot be easily removed from an album, this app is amazing. I've gotten best results using flash and holding the camera in landscape orientation. For portrait photos, hold the picture sideways. The app will often identify the correct orientation and crop it automatically. If not there are manual controls. Flash reflections will be eliminiated."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"On the one hand it did a great job at removing the glare. That is the only positive. The other hand: discoloration, skewed perspective, blurry. The reason being it takes the initial image in focus with flash (if enabled) then has you move to 4 points and takes further images creating a composite. It does not trigger the flash, nor does it wait for the camera to refocus, when it takes the other images for the compositing. The result is a composite of one clear image and 3 out of focus."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Good. We like to use PhotoScan for a long time. The most advanced. Take photos automatically. Haha. We are used to attaching Google Photos for a long time.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Absolutely disgusting don't install it the picture taken are so blurry kinda waste of time"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Good but, need more development for Android."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"OK For Quick And Dirty photos. Its fairly easy to use and generally works OK if you don't mind what the qualities like. On normal view the scanned photo looks similar (maybe a little better due to corrections) than the original. However, just magnifying it on your phone you can see how blurry it gets. App completely misses edge detection so you have to manually adjust. Great for only a couple of photos if you're mobile, too slow and qualities not there for archiving."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"The app scans just fine, but adds a giant white border to all the final images, with a ""Photoscan by Google"" watermark that needs to be cropped out. Unusable garbage."

If you work with photographs and have not tried it, do give it a look. Any other way that I had tried to crop photos and even line them up was much more difficult.

If I turn the flash off, Hair get smoothed out, while the entire picture has grains. If I turn the flash on, there is no glare but the entire picture has a completely different color temperature. There's no batch scanning either, so forget scanning entire albums in one go. Document scanning apps and (if you're willing to invest some time) the camera app do a better job."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"So so"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"The app removes glare sometimes, but not others. (I think it may have something to do with how distant the source of the glare is.) There are almost no settings, although the one that lets you adjust the corners after taking the photo is great... the app does really well correcting keystone distortion (not shooting perfectly parallel). The app does a great job on the Pixel 3A but the Pixel 6A makes terrible distortion near edges of lines: either JPEG artifacts or over-sharpening."

In most cases it fails to fully remove all glare, and so you would probably be better off taking a picture of the photo to get better, more usable resolution. App is cluncky, and results always vary. Larger and darker photos are especially bad. There is no mass export, making it difficult to do a lot of photos at once. Lastly, it's disrespectful to add a watermark on my family's photos."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Used to be really amazing, unfortunately it doesn't seem to play nicely with the pixel 6's camera. Images always appear blurry. If you have a phone other than the pixel 6 it might still work well for you."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"absoluylry shocking how poor quality this was vs just taking a photo and cropping it myself..It forces the light on which gives a horrific glare so intense the entire photo was washed out.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Can google create a really bad app. Yes, try this one and know it yourself. No save option. Very confusing And tedious on how to scan the photo. The glare is still there."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Makes the photos look brighter in contrast which reduces quality. Once you have the photos they don't store in any particular location on your phone. If you click on the share feature it gives you 3 options: 1.Print (who really owns a printer these days.) 2. Bluetooth: which fails to share 3. Amazon shopping?? - Clicking this feature will scan your scanned photo to give you the result ""we couldn't find a match"" I just wasted an hour to scan old photos so that I can look at them in an app"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"If you're an android person, this app is free and awesome. We digitized 100s of photos in just a couple of hours when my dad passed away this summer. The quality was great and worked for a huge movie-screen sideshow."

Coincidentally, I found this app the day before I accidentally found about 100 pictures from my childhood that I had never seen before. If not for this app I would have been looking for hours for something that would have given me satisfactory, or marginal, results. This app is intuitive and works exactly as it should.

The feature to eliminate the glare worked the first time, but it didn't properly detect the corners. I took a second shot of the same pic in hopes of correcting the skin tone and it didn't remove the glare properly and still had wrong skin tone. Released before it was anywhere near ready."

The Answer is: That way work the anti-grale. The app don't stop the glare effect from lights or sun, but You must find 1st the right angle to start the scanning. You find that just look at the photo from the angle, where it does not appear the light source before start the scanning. And keep that angle until end. Then photoscan automatically adjust the corners, or manually if have some difference."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Five stars for its past, now it's been deprecated and if you want a Google latest technology about document scan, use Google Drive App, it has the scan option and you can even enable the OCR, I hope Google include it with Google Lens too to make it easily understood from people coming from Microsoft Lens (even if the logic is to keep it in Drive as we need to scan and upload)"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"I took 3 pictures 1. Regular camera 4032x3024 2. Built-in scanner 3656x2616 3. Photoscan by google 2000x1500 Basically the quality drop off is so significant that you might as well just use your phone camera or whatever built in software. I took pictures of just regular text on paper instantly becomes unreadable if you use this app. Google do better."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"It's useful"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Super-easy to use. One suggestion. While the program is stiching together the four images together, a huge improvement would be to even out the brightness - as is already done with the latest version of Google's panoramic photo stitching (which, by the way, is fantastic and no longer even needs individual photos ‚Äì it is one continuous sweeping movement now, guided by little on-screen circles to help the user keep the sweep smooth and aligned)."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"I Like These Apps Alot Puta Merida Homen !!!"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Does what you want it to... If you don't care about quality. This app is very easy to learn, basically no knowledge needed! The photos, no matter what lighting I take them in always end up the same, that being faded and having a dark brown pixelated effects in darker areas. The anti-glare feature also does precious little, if anything it makes the photo even more faded. Overall, good for a quick and dirty scan, but if you're looking for high quality scans, look elsewhere"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Summary: extra steps reaults in worse pictures than Google's camera app. Tested on Pixel 5A. I tried this both in poor and decent lighting, with a glossy and matte photo. The glossy photo was out of focus with a huge band of reflection in the center as the app turned on the led flash. The matte one was in focus and detail was good, but colors were washed out. GCam took superior photos in all cases, regardless of flash/lighting, and much faster."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Great app. Instantly can scan any printed old photo quickly in a few seconds. Quality is very good. Saves a lot of time compared to a scanner and results are comparable with my scanner. Scanned photos go directly to Google Photos app. I think you can improve the quality of the scan by adjusting the light and using the flash function or not. Also, quality may depend on how good your phone camera is."

There is a separate major flaw: There is no way to re-upload or re-sync edited images with google photos in bulk -- you can only save them to google drive individually after the automatic sync to google photos. To work around this flaw, I had to find the edited pictures in the Files app then back those up to google drive then transfer over to google photos. Not an ideal UX for a common use-case."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Liked the implementation of four cornered scan to take pictures. Output still lacks the consistency to take accurate scans in terms of dimension of the original photo. At times scanned photos appear as a trapezium when the original was rectangular in shape. Photos appear stretched with faded colours. Of course the app is not perfect and has a lot to improve. Resolutions are paltry and proper alignment of photos to the original physical photo is a hit or miss. Nevertheless, an innovative app."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Very good app. Kindly add provision to update the date during scanning itself so that it appears in correct timeline in Google Photos. Otherwise we need to update in Google Photos(even multiple times if partner has enabled saving for shared photos in Google Photos)"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"When it works, it somewhat works. This app has serious focus issues on Android phones, between a Pixel 3, Galaxy Note 9, and a Moto Z, all 3 had a hard time focusing and staying focused while scanning. An actual photo scanner or your phones actual camera will probably do your higher quality photos justice compared to this app, however some blurrier photos will turn out better in some cases. Expect to have to adjust corners a ton while scanning your photos."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"I was able to get avoid getting glare in the scan by using PhotoScan, so that was nice. However, I needed to take a photo of my passport for some documents, and this app added some white space and text at the bottom of my file. Obviously I couldn't use that, so I had to edit the file and get rid of that. I wish this app hadn't added extra things to the file."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Clear and smart"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"WoW!"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Awesome for removing glare and crops beautifully. This is now my go-to app for photos too fragile to remove from albums or frames. That said, there is a fatal downside -- the resulting photos are only 2.4 mp!!!! If app were updated to use full resolution, I'd give it 6 stars. (Mar 2021 - I see that it now saves photos in 5 mp, which is better but clearly underutilizes camera sensor. I was hoping that, by now, resolution would be better even if it were only in a paid version.)"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"This app is a really cool concept but it's buggy. Most of the photos I scan are rotated sideways even though I took the pictures the right way. Sometimes the dots get skewed and/or move as I'm taking the photos causing the final result to be warped. Sometimes I can try again and it works but a couple of times I couldn't get a good photo at all."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Can't select multiple to share to a location, email, etc. That's a pretty basic feature I'd expect from something made by Google."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Helps eliminate 99% of glare. Just position your cell camera over the photo you want to copy. Take picture. A dime sized dot will appear on your screen. Just move your camera around and get the dot in one of the open circles. Now shift your camera around to get the dot in the other 3 open circles. That's it!"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Needed to scan some photos and my own scanner was elsewhere. I though I'd try this one. (lucky first dip) and was amazed at the fact it worked. I suppose it could be a bit of a pain if needed to do a batch of photos, but in my experience, so is using a normal scanner on batches. Well done to the developers for a superb app."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"it was very nice"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"I love the Google Photo Scan app. I've been using it to scan old family photographs. I find easy to use and much quicker than a flatbed scanner and the quality seems to be nearly the same. Suggestion for improvement - add an option that would capture the back of the photograph.  Many of  photographs have messages that  describe who is in the photograph or other important information."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Exceptional. Great to see such technology."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Still really excellent!!!! Very occasionally there comes along an absolutely amazing app, and PhotoScan is one of those. The ability to quickly digitize old printed photos quickly and easily is fantastic, so simple to use, my only additional thought, is whether there could/should be additional editing options once the picture had been scanned, but even without that option the result is excellent. another great application from Google. My only problem now, is finding the time to convert all my old albums, but it will certainly be done."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Good product, in fact really good if you want to scan a single photo. But if you need to scan many, then it is a pain. Resolution is fairly good. Corner/edge detection fails at times. Another point, old photos tend to get curved in, and this App often is not able to resolve corners or edges when that happens. Then, you need a speedy internet connection. Finally, and my biggest gripe - it takes a bit too long to process a single photo. Not good if you want to digitize your old photo album."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I have a flatbed scanner also but this app is easier, faster, better quality, and the images are going to end up on Google Photos anyway, or Nextcloud. It is truly an amazing app, scans done with lamp on and antiglare enabled turn out better than if done in natural light, adjusting corners is a snap, this app is pure genius. just might be the best app ever developed, next to Keep."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"This app is really good for taking pictures of old (and new) printed photos on photopaper. However, there is definitely still room for improvement. It would greatly enhance the calibre of the app if a date prompt is embedded into it, such that once a photo is taken, a date can be selected for it so that the photo matches the rest of the time line in one's electronic photo album. If you can take this into consideration that would be awesome."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Great"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Occasionally this will cut off random corners and you'll need to adjust them or try again. That's honestly not too bad since it's usually due to the background or the tilt of the camera. However, the photo quality can be - and usually is - horrible, even with a good quality camera. Sometimes it's so blurry you can't read the text on the document you're scanning, which completely defeats the purpose. I'd be better off to just take a normal photo of my document and crop it myself."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Google PhotoScan artificially limits capture resolution to around 3MP_____First impressions I would give this 5 stars; excited I even upgraded my phone because if I am to scan my entire back catalogue I want the absolute best, if I am to waste 100 hours copying photos.. However I read this on Redit. Really annoyed..... I will replace this review if i prove it wrong. So far it looks spot on though. _____________ Google PhotoScan artificially limits capture resolution to around 3MP After testing PhotoScan on a variety of pictures using four different phones, I'm sad to report that we're not getting our camera's worth from the app. The long dimension of scanned pictures is always scaled (up or down) to 2,000 pixels, compared to the 4,000-pixel capture resolution of the 6P (12.3 MP -> less than 3 MP). While a small portion of this can be justified by cropping and perspective correction, large amounts of information will always be lost if the photo you're scanning takes up more than 1/4 of the app's viewfinder. For those of you planning to sit down with the family photo album over Thanksgiving break, just know that this does not create scanned images, or even ""pictures of pictures"" (with the flash bloom removed). PhotoScan makes pre-cropped thumbnails that look great on the small screen (if you don't zoom in), and saves those memories to the cloud. What's sad is that all of this is an artificial limitation. There's no physical reason we shouldn't be able to get ~10 MP scans from a 12.5 MP sensor if we stand close enough to the subject. I love the app's concept and hope it improves with time, but this unexpected and irrational limit is truly disheartening. My old poloroids are low-res enough as it is; I can't afford for an archival app to lose even more of their detail. Tested on Nexus 5, 5X, 6, and 6P. Posted byu/silicon_reverie - 4 years ago"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"The quality of the images has been degraded wrt a normal picture from the camera.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"I had rated this two start because when shared via the App it creates a very low resolution image and attaches an annoying watermark. After doing a little investigation, I realized that the scanned image saved in my Photos was a much higher, acceptable resolution image with NO watermark. While I understand the resolution degradation for messaging the inability to control the quality and the total failure to communicate the implications of the delivery options prevents me from giving the App 5 stars."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"This app would be perfect if the low resolution didn't make it useless compared to similar apps. I get that processing is a lot faster for low res photos, but I wouldn't mind at least having the option to wait longer.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"A very easy use app with minimal editing required. But the biggest let down is there is no export option for PDF."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Third class app. Wastage of time. Don't install it. Google should learn something from CamScanner for making it useful. CamScanner is/ was as well as shall remain best scanning app."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Best DYI photo scanner out there. Amazing how much glare a smart phone camera picks up when trying to scan a photo, but Google does the best job of getting rid of it and the cropping and rotating is a piece of cake. If you have the time and the will, you will save $.75 per scan compared to sending them out to a service. Fun to share the old photos from your drawer with family that have never seen them."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Best scanner app ever, love it keep up the excellent work guys. To the developer of this app, highest level of stars to you. Customers don't listen to the negative reviews. Take my word for it, try it you will love it. When you scan in the dark you don't even get a flash back on the scan I think that's amazing. At first I got a bit confuse when you have to move your device to the dots/circle but other that it gives you a fantastic scan. My customers, love it, the quality & how fast it is."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"I apologize, I uninstalled it just after giving it a try. My feedback is. When you come with a big name you at least have to fulfill the basics. App lacks customization. App camera takes lower quality scan. No filters for brightness, contrast or anything. Company watermark is ok. But sharing option needs more file types. I hope this is in primary stage and will give us a better choice to move on it from other famous competitors. Thanks. P.S. - Do not listen to anyone. Use and you'll find truth"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Not as good as expected. My own phone camera scan photos better than that."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Very good, almost as good as a normal scanning machine but much faster!"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Resolution is not good. When I compare the scan photos with my phone (Red Mi note 5 pro) clicked photos, those photos are more clear in resolution than scan photos"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"It's sorry to say Google should add lot of options, features to get better outcome pic in this app. First it has no option to convert white page or business card view. Only the outcome is generating of simple document view without clarity.I've used MS scanner, which has versatile features to generate lots more combination with crystal clarity pic.However it hasn't consume much storage than MS scanner but prior to various features Microsoft scanner is best till today's date.Staying prospective."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Light is important to take good photos and they may be a little less sharp, but you can take a photo in a tenth (or less) of the time compared to using a desktop scanner.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Removes the glare that happens when you use your phone to take a picture of a real photo!!! Then it even auto-crops(adjustable corners if needed) and enhances the picture. Also has quick mode to take pictures of photos(with out glare removal) or papers and auto-crops them instantly! BEST AND ONLY PHOTO SCAN APP I KNOW OF THAT CAN REMOVE THAT GLARE!!!!"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Awesome Application...Loved the clearity.."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Thought this would be some cool tech but its LITERALLY taking a picture and cropping It. Literally every phone can do this already."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Very good quality of scanning and User friendly (easy to use)"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"It really opened up what you can do with the cameraand goes by face recognition and accepts it up it just displays it in such a manner it's great and we touch Emily touch it up it does all it's great"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"PhotoScan by Google.. Rate this app"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"For documents and situations where resolution is not important, this app works great. However, resolution is bad. This app should use the combined photos to create an image that is higher resolution and higher quality than is possible with the normal camera app. Instead, the resolution is low and there are unacceptable artifacts visible when zooming in."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"It's the 8th wonder"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Wow... I cant believe how easy and good this app works. Good going guys!üëç"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"PhotoScan absolutely delivers as promised. Picture perfect and glare free enhanced digital scans of all your printed photos via your phones camera. Excellent approach/method to securely back up all printed photos (hard copy). The automatic cropping based on edge detection is executed with precision and care. However, smart rotation keeps your photos right-side-up, no matter which way you scan them. Overall, all printed photos captured via PhotoScan are safely backed up via Google Photos."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Very good"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"The app should be able to keep the flash on when in use and OCR should be included in it's features"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Everything is fine but the only problem is the tutorial. I can't skip it after each installation. You should keep a option to skip tutorial."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"I had a great time do you think they'll be better of at schools"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"This was hard for me to rate it offs btwn a 3-4 for me sometimes it helps take a better photo especially in situations that you don't have the luxury of finding a well lit area... when you can I would take pics without the app because it takes forever comparably"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"i dont about learn this app but rate comments is not bad could useful in clear picture effect"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Scan is neat, but it puts a giant ""photoscan by Google photos"" frame around my shared photos but hides this frame within the app -- embarassing."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Excellent Application and utility. Very useful to convert old photos digitally."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Just don't get it, the pictures get blurrier than just taking the picture with my camera. What's the point of the 4 dots?"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Good Good"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"This app can be awesome but the overall final quality of the ""scan"" is very poor compared to the ""one shot"" picture of the camera app. Looks like that this app is forced to output 1 megapixel picture. Meh"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"If I could give a comment without stars I would! The one time I actually got it to scan, the picture had a GIANT glare!!!!"

Way to much stress, so I just used my phone camera in a spot with no glare and no spots on the screen to follow. Sorry... It would be great."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"I have scanned photos of various aged from 5 years to 60 years old and they all scam brilliantly. I have S9 phone. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because it can drain your battery. Keep phone on charge as you scan and all is good."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Output result is blurrier and lower resolution than just using native google camera app. Photo is taken before view is centered on one of the 4 dots, so the photo is taken when you are still moving. The result cannot be expected to be anything but poor from this behaviour."

I have thousands of photos to scan, I'm not removing them all from their albums.... The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there are other apps where you can scan multiple photos in one shot, so I know the technology is out there. If this app upgraded and took advantage of that feature, I would change my rating to 5 stars immediately!"

It would be great to see if google has similar features to camscanner app. Thanks"

It would be great if option to change the date of the scanned photo is provided (currently it shows up on Google Photos as an on date photo, which is weird for a photo from 50 years ago). Another feature that i would like to see in this app is the ability to make albums, so that date of the entire album can be set manually, instead of doing it individually for the photos. Please consider making these changes."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app for scanning a picture for a picture. It helps get rid of glare that a single picture would not get rid of. Picture should be flat, and well lit for best results. It does not do perspective control, and it is not an image editor - it didn't claim to be. What would make it better (for me) is that since it is sort of taking five pictures to make one, the option to save the picture at a higher resolution. A very good program for its intended job, and it's free."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"The advertised functions work quite well. But it was a disappointment to see that there are no colour correction options in the app and nonoptions to patch punch holes or other damages on photos. Photos tend to discolour or old ones have a strong red hue over them. It would be nice, if there were options in this app to manually or even automatically correct colours. This program has no options to do any editing. A missed chance and a big disappointment. Tip: Move the camera towards the dots."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"üôèüôè"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"It was one of the best app I always recommend but since the new updates the flash stopped working when the dots show. For the first shot the flash did get on, but when the dots came it just turn off even in the dark/no lights condition."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"I am amazed with how good this app works! I wish I'd found it a long time ago. It works extremely well. I've scanned pictures in old photo albums that are too old to even try to remove the photos or protective plastic. I've also taken pictures of framed photos and paintings on the walls, with great success. I can be at a relative's house, and scan photos in no time. Which allows me to have copies of pictures that I otherwise wouldn't have a copy of. Get it!!"

I will give 4 stars due to a missing feature that I would really love to have, the option to set the timestamp of the picture before (or after). For old photo albums, where you can have several photos at the same day, it would be easy to do and also it would show correctly on Google Photos timeline."

Also tested against a variety high gloss pictures with my Note9 Of course, it is not perfect; in which there would be slight smudging around hair and blending colors.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"pretty disappointed. On sligly bent pictures, it does does a bad job at detecting corners, as it prefers the shadow thrown to the actual corner. Also does not do perspective correction on such non-perfectly-flat pictures. Prefers to overcrop; will even overcrop if you manually set the corner, so you have to game its logic if you want the info at the border included, like the date in my case. Detecting hard edges is really no magic. I guess it does a good job at colors."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Great app and I have a suggestion. Many old photos have timestamps on them or at the back.. It would be cool if Photoscan can automatically recognise the timestamp or ask the user to capture the timestamp at the back or just input manually.. and then the app stores it in the ""date taken"" EXIF tag."

The idea of ""virtually"" increasing the photo resolution by stitching together four separate photos might sound like a good idea, but is it really necessary?

Also, check Text Fairy - while purpose is different (scanning text), it's superior in shaping scan into rectangle, while yours is poor. Try it and you realise what you need to fix in your product. Still, it made acceptable image, except for the small image on 4K and unreadable timestamp. P. S. I have couple others installed, and one suggestion from comments, so I think I'll be fine.

Taking a regular photo results in much better quality for both large format and standard 8.5x11. I used this app with a Pixel 3.

I get lots of blur and double-vision effects. I get better output from a regular camera photo. I'm using a Google Pixel 3, so go figure.  As for the basics: After scanning, there is no photo adjustment. No brightness, no color, no rotation. There's no way to LABEL THE PHOTOS!? No way to organize them in folders!? No way to choose storage location/card. This seems half-baked at best."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"This app tickles my geekhood just right. It's pretty nifty for getting a photo or document on your phone rapidly. But as far as picture quality, realistically, you can't hold perfectly still. A bargain basement $30 scanner would blow it out of the water."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"I really love the idea, and the execution is quite solid. There is one big flaw, though, which is that color reproduction is quite bad if your lighting is not very well engineered. Also I wish it could be used to get bit higher resolution (Which should be possible since it is basically image composition)   My key concern, though, is color. For that what I wish they'd add is option to use color patches for calibration (So have black and white squares next to the photo and use those for black/white point)   Also option to export raw format and can be edited later on desktop would be nice. At the moment I think this app is cool, but it isn't good enough that I'd dare to destroy the physical copies of the pictures."

Even the recent addition of manually readjusting where the app believes the edges of the scan are supposed to be feels like threading a needle while wearing colossal oven mitts--there's no zoom-in or guide to aid you while you try to adjust a pixel-thick line on a tiny murky capture."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"This is terrible. Removing glare is great, but who cares if the resolution is so poor? What others have said is correct, it's better to just take a picture of the photos with your camera app then crop manually. Takes much longer but at least your not losing detail."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"I gave up after 4-5 pictures. The app turns on the flash, and was not able to create a picture without glare."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"The idea of this app, according to me is very innovative but the app will do with some development."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Idea is great, but it has various UI/UX issues: Doesn't always take the corners well. Doesn't have it easy to adjust them. Doesn't allow to scan multiple photos at the same time. Doesn't allow to adjust multiple photos (need to exit&enter each, which is frustrating). Doesn't have any action on scanned photos except for deletion. Doesn't have easy multi-selection on scanned photos. Doesn't allow to group scanned photos into an album like the original one."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Was really excited about this app as I have boxes of old photos that need saving. However after a few photos I checked and the quality of the image resolution seemed really poor. I have a galaxy S9 plus so not a camera issue. I tried comparing a scan to a simple photo of a photo and the photo definition was much better, but obviously needed cropping. I don't know why the quality of a photo would be so much better than the scan, especially as you need to scan over the 4 dots."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",2,"Great idea but poorly executed. The app works great for capturing a photo without glare (unless every shot/angle includes identical glare) and cropping appropriately, but as others have commented, the quality of the finished result is just dire -to the point of the app being unusable until they fix it. Bizarre since the regular camera app takes much better quality images. Try it yourself side-by-side before you use this to digitise your old family photo library!"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"Not fit for purpose. Tedious to use for multi page docs because of need to 
specify corners. 99.99% of scanned images are rectangular so pls use this 
information rather than ask me to find the corners. BUT main problem is 
terrible scan quality, also it insists on using flash. Even forcing flash 
off, quality of scanned A4 pages is very poor, very hard to read text. I am 
using a pixel + android p so I know the hardware is good. MS Office Lens is 
far better quality scan and auto-fits to photo corners (so don't need to 
play ""find the corner"" so much faster throughout of multi page docs).

good to have a negative scanner into the app."

scanning and combining but it's too glary. It's not a perfect app. Please 
install Camscanner or some other photo scanner app instead of this"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"This app is not talk back friendly. Blind people would make use of the app

you listening Microsoft?... It's for the occasional need... Otherwise you 
would want to use a dedicated photo scanner."
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"after doing that dot exercise instead of taking an instance nap and moving 
around 4 5 places hoping to get the best result actually all you get is a 
low resolution picture and finer details are not available the app does not 
have any kind of setting to increase the pixels to change the mode to macro 
focus or any other feature that a professional scanners photographer would 
find useful this is totally 101."

pictures you take with it, and for that it works great. Interface is clean 
and simple, though I do wish there was an option to turn off the automatic 
frame that is applied when you export photos (I dont particularly want all 
my photos branded with ""google"" on a white frame) But you can easily get 
around that by just opening your phone's gallery app, navigating to the 
photo scan folder and exporting or uploading the photos from there."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Nice working app"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Good"
"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"This app is very good but a bit uncomfortable to use with the 4 dots feature scanning method. I wish Google had added an auto detect scan feature like the Adobe Scan app. It would've made this the perfect photo scan app."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"Thanks again to Google for another useful application to suit most people. Personally, I haven't used it yet but am looking forward to editing my review at that time.  For those people who felt compelled to leave a negative review, there are a few points that that you should consider.  (#1) The app is FREE, (#2) The condition of the original source photo and focus should have everything to do with what you are expecting (i.e. - 110 photo or Polaroid, overexposed with heads cut off and mildew damage probably won't resemble an Olan Mills portrait), (#3) A picture of a picture is a fine alternative.  If none of these points satisfy you and you can build a time machine and recreate the moment, up to and including the resurrection of long dead relatives to hold fake smiles and not close their eyes, then please do and let me know in the comments, until then I will patiently hold my breath until I turn blue.   To Google, thanks again and keep up the good work!"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",4,"Used this app to scan old family photos,  especially if my grandmother who passed away about a year ago,  for the most part works great,  has some really awesome features like the ability to adjust the corners to fix the perspective so you can get a head-on view of a photo that's hanging hough up on a wall,  and the ability to eliminate MOST OF the glare.  The glare elimination isn't flawless, but does work fairly well. With a little tweaking, should run smooth as butter.  Keep up the great work Google! I look forward to trying out your future experiments!"

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"Cool concept and well-implemented from a user experience point of view. Very good at capturing a photo without glare. But it can't be 5 stars for me until it can capture high-quality photos.

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",5,"This app has come a long way in the short time that it has been out. When stitching pictures of text together sometimes double vision / blurring occurs, however, this does not appear to happen when capturing pictures of paintings / art work.  I love the cropping and automatic perspective correcting features; pictures nearly always come out with no glare.  It would be good to have an option for capturing art works at high Res and text files / documents at a more optimal file size. At this stage the app seems to do a good job of this automatically, however, it would be a nice option to have 'manual' or 'auto' file size management."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"When it correctly identifies the edge of the photo, it does a good job of receiving the glare that one would typically have when taking a picture of a picture.  I've scanned about 5 pictures and on 2/5 I didn't have to retake the picture.  The rest took more than two times for the app to correctly find or at least have the edge in the picture."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",3,"I hardly ever write reviews so take that for what it is worth .....I was in a hurry to scan pictures for a slideshow at a funeral.  Thought it might be faster to try an app rather than use my scanner at home.  There were still plenty of glares in several of the photos even though it came up and said not to worry about the glares.  Many came in blurry and had to rescan.  Some were clear on the bottom and blurry on top.  Some had very distorted sections in the photos - likes faces.  I scanned about 150 photos in just a couple of hours.  It was simple to use.  The lighting in the room where you scan makes a difference.  I wanted to check what a good distance from the pict was as I am sure that makes a difference.  And it is good to make sure the phone is level.  My phone was almost full on storage, so I was surprised that I didn't fill it with as many photos as I scanned.  I picked this program first to try and didn't try any others as I thought I would be --  spending some of my time just trying out different apps."

"PhotoScan by Google Photos","Unknown",1,"I'm sorry but this app is terrible. I expect so very much more from a Google product. I am very disappointed and Alphabet has lost some of my trust. The only constructive criticism I can offer is take Google's name off of this app or take the app back to the so called drawing board. Sorry guys, you missed the mark so bad I'm not even sure if you were aiming."
