"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very bad service"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Added page limit. Had this app since the start of the pandemic, and now I will be deleting it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"One of the worst apps i have ever used"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Always processes documents, not sure why, even when All options are turned off. Unless it processes we cannot share or use the document scanned!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too much adds and restrictions. Just trying to make you pay for it too hard. There are other free and better ones"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be EXCELLENT and now I can not even choose which Google drive folder to synch to ! Why fix what was perfect ? Excellent program but did not appreciate being forced to evaluate to stop interroption. This is a paid program if the customer does not want to make a review give him a break!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, wish it was cheaper though"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Quality has declined after changing hands. Wasted money on this app. Moved to another free app and getting better scan results."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Thanks for no longer being blocked by Google Drive. Finally the app does again the one thing it's supposed to do."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Issues with gDrive are fixed! The best scanning app (used to be ScanBot) is now working properly again!!! This app is THE BEST."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"OK"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The scanning works fine but I don't think the AI or OCR works. My pdfs (fairly small) have been stuck in 'queued' and there's no way to cancel it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very useable scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Trying to get a bug figured out with acquiring vip. 5 mega stars if it can be figured out. Otherwise it's a incredible app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not able to connect google drive. It happened starting Jan 2025. Shows ""This app is blocked This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account."""
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too many tricks to get you to click stuff that makes them money, try a free no other info app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Will not let me create a >2 page scan, I expected more from the free version"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super and easy to use App !!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Google Drive Sync is broken and the App shows an error, if you try to establish a connection to your Google Account. Support does not provide any information if and when this will be fixed in the future. Please fix this problem."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Bought lifetime on StackSocial: Need to take a page from camscanner. extract text without having to save a scan. this sprouts be awesome. Request autoupload to more cloud services (pcloud) AND autoupload local folder and ftp. faxing is cool but too expensive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now the interface is more cluttered, they added AI nonsense and I can't upload to Google drive anymore"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Absolutely dumb. When trying to take pictures of mail almost all have a tiny QR code assuming for the senders processing. Damn app won't take a photo of the doc unless I've covered the QR code!!! COME ON."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The actual scanning of docs is excellent. However, the interface for uploading documents and pics is convoluted and unreliable. I've lost count on the number of uploads that I have lost while trying to upload to the cloud. The file movements interface should be a simple, easy to use system, which is why my rating is not 5 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"In the recent Nov 2024 update they broke their Google Drive integration (User just sees an error: ""This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access.""). No idea how their QA process could miss this.. Reporting to their support also didnt provide any info if this will be fixed and when."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Do not use. Always blurry. My camera works fine but this app is always blurry. It worked well years and years ago, but now it is non-operational. Don't pay for this or waste time downloading it. There aren't options in the settings to alter the camera settings Aslo, I paid for this years ago and then they wanted me to buy it again, which I did, because I was in a rush to scan and it doesn't even work. Garbage app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Device sync and Automatic upload cannot be linked to Google account. it's blocked by Google.please advise, App responsive is best, user friendly, I might switch to this ..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ads, subscription, bad permission policy. It used to be feature-complete and went without updates for years but the owner got greedy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Stopped working with Google Drive. And it is trying to upsell more stuff I don't need."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Edit: No longer syncs to Google Drive. This was just the best APP for scanning and uploading documents!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not great. Loaded with predatory and deceptive ad popups."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"In data saftey section, app makes no mention of collecting browsing data. Once you install the app however. They force you go consent to sharing your browsing data? Why does Google allow these deceptive apps on their own app store?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst Scanning App Ever Used"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Broken After Update (again). This time, the automatically saved PDFs are empty. I have to export the PDF a second time for the correct content."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A little hard to navigate, but gets the job done!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It is not possible to upload files do Google Drive anymore. ""This app is blocked"" is the error. Probably this is problem on SwiftScan side."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Been using for many years. Was great now it's AI..AI ... And subscription ...Don't want it. Also no longer syncs with Google drive. I just want to scan receipts . Btw found out google drive has the same feature built in so using that"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Just need it to do a simple pdf save and upload. Way too many clicks. Early versions were better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It does not provide useful services in the free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"They used to be one time payment app. Now they are a subscription app. I am deleting it as I hate subscription apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"after the newest update swift scan is unusable on my pixel 7, because it keeps wanting me to grant permissions that it already has. ""SwiftScan wants additional access to your Google Account"" Google says there's an error in the app. please fix!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Cloud sync stopped working, and apart from the ads... can we please stop getting AI shoved down our throats?! I just need to scan documents and have them uploaded, period. This app used to do the job smoothly. Now it doesn't anymore"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Nutze die App eigentlich schon lange und gernel. Aber... Seit dem letzten Update merkt sich die App nicht mehr meine Scan-Einstellungen, was extrem lästig und aufwendig ist. Es ist unklar, ob dies Absicht ist, um den Nutzer zum Abo zu zwingen. Vor dem Hintergrund, dass Funktionen aus einer früheren Einmalzahlung nun nicht mehr inklusive sind, da auf ein Abo umgestellt wurde, werde ich sicherlich nicht erneut Geld bezahlen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanner...gets job done quickly..,thank you"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Edit: app has become unbearable"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"não tem mais nenhuma funcionalidade gratuita. é melhor usar o do Adobe que oferece tudo gratuitamente e precisa pagar apenas se quiser alguma recursos a mais, mas o básico (scanear e baixar o scan) é gratuito."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"this has been so far the best scanner app I have used. very happy. very intuitive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Usefull aplication"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Always the best"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Previously purchased no longer functions as purchased, now requires a subscription and have filled the app with advertisements that interfere with use of the application. Can't recommend this app any longer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I had purchased full version of this App and after the vendor changed it to monthly or yearly subscription, the app not working anymore, get stuck on camera scanning initial mode and does not let me access my previous scanned files anymore. Not recommended anymore, lost all my stored scanned files through this app. Update. The updated version seems to have fixed the previous issues."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be very good. Now filled with ads. Daily notification to see ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app, love the auto OCR and Drive upload."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like this app, different functions and quality!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was free in the past, now it is full of advertisements and subscriptions"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I've used the app for years as it does it's job really well: scan - process - share/save. Less than 5 stars because: 1) Google Drive is currently not supported: (""This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access."") 2) I cannot access my documents from the file manager, nor can I choose what folder the app saves files too (access denied). This means that my scans aren't accessible for me! (unless I set up an FTP server somehow)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"All I want do to is to scan to PDF and upload to a shared drive. Multi page scans are asking if I want to use the camera, image or file all the time. That was not the case in the past. Real deal breaker since last week, uploaded PDFs are plain white pages missing the content."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I paid for this a while back and now it's full of stinking adverts. Also no longer connects to Drive: ""This app is blocked.. This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access."""
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Use ""CamScaner"" it's better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No longer able to upload scans to Google Drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"im loving my app store more and more it has been an adventure"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Al parecer se volvio una apliyde suscripción lo que habia pagado antes ya no es valido, una pena"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Update: it's now subscription based. Pretty good scanner, but the free version is a bit too limited. Also, processing should be done after you take a picture not before because as it stands it requires keeping the phone steady and it takes a while. There's no way to share a single page from a document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nidhanam bhavgeet album"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Can not connect to Google drive Been here since your early days and lived it. PIx for the app and now I can not sync to Google Dru e. Error says login was blooked by Google for my protection."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app made my life so much easier!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The app is fine. I have it via Play Pass (I.e.paid version) and it was ttelling me I've reached the scan limit (after maybe 20 scans of receipts). Hence, changed to 3* review but now back to 5* as it seems to have fixed itself back to the subscription version"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Free BS"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Deleting the app. I only wanted the fax portion as part of my play pass. Despite the description, theres no fax support."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent👍👏😆"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Sandeep"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Captured my first scan, clicked on save, a video ad popped up, no close button on ads, tried to close it 10 times but failed. At least put closable ads. Dumb app. Poor user experience."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I got a message from Google, that SwiftScan requests acces to sensitive info of my Google account, but Google did not verify SwiftScan and that I should not use it until the developer verifies SwiftScan with Google! I wanted to connect SwiftScan with Google Drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Delete"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does everything you need a scanning app to do!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Vem todas as informações em inglês Vem todas as informações em inglês"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Poor app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"If I can use my phone camera then merge images and convert to pdf it takes about as long as it does for the free version of ScanBot. The only reason I can think of keeping the free version is for pdf but they might cut down on that in future also. The issue for me is that they start with a decent free app but then restrict use over time. It's not even like it's a free trial. It used to be good and now it's terrible unless you pay for an annual subscription. Granted it's not that expensive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Riddled with ads and the scans are pretty poor a lot of the time. Can't recommend this to anyone nowadays. Super easy to accidentally delete the scan as well just due to how many ads there are. Terrible software. Try Microsoft Lens instead. Much better without ads, and the scan quality is way better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I purchased Swiftcan Plus for 12$ several years ago. Now I can't access the app without paying a subscription. Refund please!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"New version only lets you scan 2 pages before making you sign up for a subscription"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Help me to get the all apps to complete the Google Play store and vivo Y81 then phone settings."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Only one scan a day on the free version, therefore almost useless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, highly recommend it. Seamless integration and such a time saver when going paperless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Extremely well developed product. I do wish I could edit the ocr text from within the program and save it rather than exporting it into another program to edit ocr text."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It is not upload pdf ocr scanner it is xamera one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"If you had the version before subscriptions it was great. It's probably not worth it now."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"best application for pdf"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So helpful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"😄😄😄"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Since there is limit on number of pages to scan, the app became completely useless for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great, useful app. Now it's so bogged down by ads, the content is overwhelmed to the point of unusability. Deleting."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"you really want to tell me we can only do one scan for free? i watched three ads while scanning just for the second scan not to go through because ""i am out of scans"" and then when i tried to sign up for premium i kept receveing errors. ridiculous"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Constantly spammed to upgrade to pro subscription, which I have been paying for already. ""Restore Purchases"" doesn't work to associate the subscription with app. Avoid this ripoff."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Terrible OCR"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works well for a phone app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Reacts and scans clearly and quickly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I love it, the quality is very good, but I find it fiddly getting it to focus on the whole document before it scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it's a very useful tool with great options. Love it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It says that Faxing is supported but it doesn't show as an option."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Difficult to get play pass working... But the app is great. Add text and signatures easily"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Only scan docs and id cards three times free but than after subscription option appears which is too annoying."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super💯💯💯💯"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"30s video ad after every scan makes it unusable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Yep"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"babura"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works great!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks for updating the App I love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's not a scanner. It just takes pictures which my phone camera can do just fine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scanning is fine and that is it. Annoying things like among to barcode read it not scan the item itself."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This might be Switzerland Country"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Pay pay pay money only"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"they might want to tone it down with the adds a bit... otherwise 5 stars 🌟"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app SUCKS! Two page maximum and then after 3 or 4 scans, it was forcing me to sign up for a subscription."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use an intuitive!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Dont have paid version but the free version is a solid 3."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excelent scanner app. Straight forward, easy to handle. But one essential feature is missing and may be a deal breaker. No possibility to sort into folders. Please add this feature. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: Still love this app as my go to scanner. But needs to add passcode or biometrics to lock access (as on iOS version)! Overall a great app. What I'd like to see is that the camera can be controlled to manually take picture. The app will often scan page before I have a chance to align the page, forcing me to take repeated photos of page before its correct. (UPDATE: Changed to 5 stars, based on feedback from developer. Manual picture does indeed work well.)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Had the pro version through Play Pass. Now it wants me to pay for it. App also keep closing instead of uploading scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not say it contains ads. If you don't opt to pay for a subscription, there are ads. I don't like deception. Would not have downloaded if they had been honest about the ads. Don't like ad ware, and not looking for a subscription service."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"very good ....but multiple adverts make it tedious to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So many things that u can do"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app! Pleasure to work with!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very very bad why showing this app in first only due to sponsored .but app is 'Ghatiya'"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not warking"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"My phone appointment dates pay help screen my address please."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"As a reader it works good as the editing had some problems but still works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It doesn't go ahead the ""Join Our Newsletter"" screen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No longer useful - only one free scan and maximum ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too much ads I have no time to save my files"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not free usefull"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"swift scan ii afavorate app for me and also ts to help in My job."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I used to use this during the pandemic and was great. You could have unlimited scans and multiple page pdfs but now they decided to make it paid. Disgusting."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, now full of interrupting ads and not free anymore"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"You have to pay monthly to add more than 5 pages."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"farmers no."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app ever honestly and the only one I reviewed in ma life"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst app I ever seen 🤯"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"spins and spins and doesnt complete scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Chaind Ali"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was a great app for years but now with their aggressive subscription plan the app is blocked until you subscribe."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Edit: Updated review, I have the paid version and this app now shows ads. Will be replacing it. Old review: Good app, some annoying parts. I don't know what camera it's using (phone has 3) but it can't get all of a document in focus at once. It also doesn't allow me to select a different camera. It has a very annoying, loud, and unmutable sound when you tap to focus which wasn't there in the past. Even with all audio on my phone muted, it plays this annoying sound."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"What the hell with the ads on the latest version? I paid for the premium version not to receive ads!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"New"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I'm using gplay pass but there is ads in app, wth. Also bcuz im i civil servant in need scanning alot ppl ""legal document"" its keep warning me with kegal issue, wth im civil servant bro ofc everyday im process alot confidental/legal/any document but its legal cuz its my work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Kurang bagus agak lemot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unauthorized charging of subscription"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"5 stars if it didn't make me pick jpg or pdf each time I share, there should be a way to mark a default genius scan wins in this area"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good Scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works as expected"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App doesn't work anymore properly (can't download scans to the phone's storage and can't send them to cloud services anymore) and features like accessing previous scans have been hidden behind a scummy subscription service. Not every app needs a subscription model."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, it completely makes the app useless unless you pay"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Best app thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Cloud service upload with Google drive is a mess can only select one account and it is not the account I want."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Developer-Rotche Capuyan Ouano"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Adobe scan is free and better. It is asking for money for every single thing like syncing to cloud or not showing ads or to edit a pdf and the worst is watermark of thier name on every page. Adobe doesn't do this with you. And they have much more options like size selection and clean up of documents. Totally useless app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Way too many ads just to perform one action."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Generally been good but at the moment can't access scanned documents. Keeps going to scan and crashes every time try going back out of scan mode."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"just installed a moment back and before opening it I gone through review section and found that annoying advertisement and review request are often popping up while using application.so I changed my mind even though application is good and Google play awarded editor's choice. sorry."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"As a paying customer who's been using the app for years, here's why I give it one star: - incessant requests to review. I reviewed it years ago, but still every time I use it, it asks me to review it again. - it's now showing me ads (""tips and deals') even though I've paid for this app. The people that made this app turned a nice product into something frustrating to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Really great app to get the latest “Tips & Deals”. Before they introduced this feature I only used the app to scan documents. But now I can discover new offers, inspiring content, articles & more even with the paid version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The stupidity is that you need to wait for OCR to complete before you can share!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent Performance"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not the program it used to be. Uninstalled & can't recommend the free or premium versions."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tips and deals in a scanner app? Yeah... no. And with the same update, OCR got broken uselessly drowning battery. Well done!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Now is working again. It seem like not every update is helpful. It was a 5 star before. Hopefully it will be great again."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"🚨 What in the world?! Why am I seeing ads on a supposed Pro Version? And why are we required to sign up just to access all the features?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now bloated with spam and adds and trying to force an upgrade. Makes using it fairly unpleasant."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worked ok for first docs then slowed and stopped. Bad pics"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"An indispensable app! I've used this app for Android for 6+ years now, and it ls return for the price of the app is incredible. It has allowed me to go paperless and handle otherwise paper-painful processes 100% digitaly. Highly recommended!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I'm compelled to update my review to express my disappointment regarding the alterations this app underwent after its acquisition by Maple Media. Many of the core functions that were once part of Scanbot Pro are now restricted behind a subscription paywall with Swiftscan. I used to be a paid user of Scanbot Pro on both Android and iOS. I've now switched to Genius Scan, a trusted tool in my arsenal for years, which continues to work seamlessly without adversely affecting its users."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This app used to be great. Not so much any more. When you want to save the files you have to sit through a long ad and it won't come back up to the program until you go through Google Play and search for swift scan. Then it allows you to x out the ad. Ridiculous!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was essential and recommended for my online exams by my lecturers during first year uni two years ago for being fast. Now it's ad-infested, slow and pay to use. Go for a cracked older version of can. Not worth it now."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This is garbage. I deleted it because this has toxic advertisements that makes it unusable for even the slightest productivity. This is a waist of your life and time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I want my money back. I bought the product once in 2020, before it changed its name. Why is my account completely gone now?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Swift can is pretty good. I'm glad to have found it, I was seeking for a free app and found this one. Other than the watermark on the trail scans, it's very good. Thanks for the opportunity to experience the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's too difficult to use properly. Constantly popping up about upgrading. There are too many disruptive ads while trying to navigate and figure out how to use the app. Won't automatically scan my paper."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really enjoy this app. Makes life easier when away from office technology."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Buggy - can't rename scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"App used to work perfectly for years. In recent months I can't use the rename option anymore, because it randomly deletes anything I type. Also the camera became super sensitive to any movement so it's really difficult to get sharp pictures."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Update: Star deducted for constantly nagging if I like it/please review. I reviewed just to see it'll stop and didn't. It's great. BUT STOP ASKING ME to rate it. At least give me a option of ""stop asking"". I'm posting this in the hopes that the app will stop nagging me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Trash. Wont let you save, gives you a ""qr"" code."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be able to use it, now it's just slow, covered in ads, and won't let me export unless I pay for premium."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Ok app, only thing is the description says no in app purchases with play pass, but if you want all the features unlocked you have to subscribe monthly for the pro features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Sorry to downgrade 5 to 2 star - the file naming dialog is extremely broken for me, refusing keyboard input and exiting causes the entire scan to be dropped. And many other parts of the ui (share and edit menus) are often unresponsive. Needs to be fixed"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"My own camera is better than this. Sticking to CamScanner Free Version. Was hoping this may be better, but it's 100% not"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now theyve gotten too greedy and gone too far with the ads. Now its judt horrible and unbearable to use especially when theres so many better apps out there"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"App has been a life saver! It's come in very handy whenever I've needed it. I have a scanner hooked up to my computer, but it sometimes has issues. Also this app is very convenient & portable (mobile)."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Immediately asks for a subscription and bombards you with ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I paid for pro years ago, but now the app demands a subscription for the feaures i already had, without making any noticeable recent improvements or bugfixes to justify it. If anything, it seems to have gotten buggier over time. I guess after years of use, i am now hunting for a new app..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"More useless garbage installed without permission"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Interesting!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far I love the app. It says in app purchases available. Will it alert me when there is a charge? Just a general question. I'm not very savvy with these types of scanners .... lol 🤣 Ty for your response !!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"video shows fax option but doesn't fax."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's very misleading to have it as a free app, If everything except for 'Unlimited Scans' is free, I'd suggest changing it into a paid app. I see no point in keeping it in the free app section.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Nothing swift about having to click through 5 adverts and watching 1 video then getting forced to the play store to download a dating app, then asked to review the app.. when all you want to do is scan 1 page."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has seemed to change names several times but it's functionality has only improved. Easy and good quality scans. I also love the wide variety of ways to share."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"omg the intrusive tictoc ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not working anymore. I have the paid version and processing takes hours to complete, even with ocr off."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Seems all my scans are coming out fuzzy. So, I end up taking a picture, then importing it into SwiftScan. Help!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I need to know if it paid app or for free if will show advertisement?!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Works good, but forces you to switch to a premium app even if you pay playpass"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanner ..works fine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Trying to scan a receipt with a QR code just opens the QR code. Super frustrating. There is a setting, but it really should be possible to do a regular scan after a QR code is recognized. Scan quality even with best quality looks terrible. I'm better off manually taking a picture and cropping it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like that app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"used to be a great product but if you don't buy, it's a real pain with multiple adverts popping up making it almost unusable"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years. It has always outperformed other scanning apps. Definitely, my go-to app to scan with!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded the app and scanned one, one page document. I saw the DOC in the window, it told me not to move - it then scanned the document, and asked what I want to do with it, eg. Filter, crop, send, etc and it does it. So 5 stars because it is better than I expected."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I loved this app for ease of scanning and automatic upload to Evernote. It was worth the paid version given the volume I would scan. Somewhere along the line the ability to upload to Evernote was lost and the app is no longer useful. What happened to Evernote?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app and so easy to use. Upload to all the cloud services with ease. My top tip is to turn off barcode/qr reader in the settings otherwise camera will pick up those rather than scan the doc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The worst. It is nothing but ad machine and not even better than 20 mb apps. Just lets you scan 2 pages without sub. Only"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Spammy garbage with an ad after every scan. Avoid!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Goodo"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exlend"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"the insistence to install junk apps like Tiktoc after every scan makes this app worthless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Whales only - Not worth a monthly payment for anyone with a functional mind. Paying $4.99 every month for app that remains static in development is just silly. With the plethora of apps on the market, selling an app that a customer already purchased, to them again each month, without a significant upgrade, is going to increase in difficulty with a quickness when they can just go grab a different app in the store instead. I would recommend finding a different solution than this app."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Didn't even make it to scan a document, video ads blocked usage"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Not worth it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Got much better results just using my camera. This app is extremely sensitive, I have to hold my breath for several seconds while keeping my camera in place because any movement at all would cause to start the process over again. And while the text in my document was perfectly clear through the camera, the scanned copy was blurred to the point of illegibility. Have to go through multiple ads right when I opened the app before I could even do anything was the icing on the cake."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Has become riddled with ads. Random scans QR codes and texts instead of scanning the document itself."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Yet another monthly pay model. Uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"🍾🍾"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"To many ad pop ups"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"If you subscribe to Google's playpass for $5.00 a month you don't have to watch ads & you can get lots of different apps for only 5.00 a month... I L💜VE THE APP😎"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app was amazing. I've used the it for 3 years. However, new free plan is completely useless. So I have to find another app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I am New add it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"love SwiftScan! Hate, hate the ads!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Doesn't recognize any text"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Worked fine the first two times, then started being buggy. It won't save the first scanned page, just the second. The saving takes forever, sometimes it won't save the scanned document at all. The UI is not very intuitive. The ads are so intrusive! I almost got a heart attack when a full-page, video ad with audio enabled jumped out at me. Why would anybody think this is the way to get new buyers??"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No possible to use with out interrupted by add."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The ads in the free version are ridiculous. Hence the low rating."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too many adds. Every click has multiple ads making it impossible to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I used this app for years and loved it. Today I discovered it was changed so that I can only scan 2 pages before needing to subscribe. I'm uninstalling it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Was perfect! But now freeusers are more limited"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Doesn't work anymore"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Abheka"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Updated for the first time in a long time, and now it shows a video ad each time you scan. I'm out! Google Camera has a built in scanner feature; using that now."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"After changing from a pixel phone to Asus, scans are chronically under-exposed. No amount of lighting helps, the camera always adjusts to darken the image, and SwiftS recognizes this by pinning brightness compensation to max, afterwards. Locked from Google uploading - unexplained. Looking for alternative app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very handy and crisp documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Round on the service on the phone service on"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"V.good"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Didn't save my scanned documents anywhere, and they wouldn't give me my money back."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"absolutely fantastic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I'm overwhelmed by the amount of ad banners and nag screens. Every update introduces more and more ads. Uninstalling."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Yeaaa"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app sad you have to pay"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great results, easy to use app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Eicselent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I loved this app. It was simple and it worked great. In the last year, I have seen nearly all features stripped away unless you pay 20 bucks a year! I was ok with ads but I was truly astounded to receive a notification today saying I could not scan more than 2 pages without a subscription. As a student, this was an invaluable app but this is unusable to me now."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was an amazing and well crafted app until they started blocking a bunch of flows with intrusive and spammy ads. I wouldn't mind dismissible ones, but these are full screen, and even attempting to do swipe gestures on my phone triggers a click to the Play Store. it takes several clicks on skip buttons that only show up after a long delay to close them. I wish they wouldn't be so scammy with their ads, and I'll probably switch apps soon."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Cannot read text at all"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"doesn't look work as the advertisement says."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too Many Adds I never even got to use the Scanner. The ADDS hit you almost immediately after opening the app. Just one after another. I didn't let it get past 3. I uninstalled it before I even got a chance to try out the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"If I could give zero stars I would. This app barely works on a good day. It's painful to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"""good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now adware trash. When if was ScanBot it worked great, but either they sold out to another company or went rogue and ruined the app. Haven't used it in a while but now it's almost completely unusable with unskippable ads and multiple popups to scan one receipt. Trust the most recent reviews and not the older ones because this is not the same app that received 4+ star rating. Find a different app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I've used swift scan for years without any issues. The pro features were nice but not required. Since the last few updates, swift scan now paywalls most features, added ads, bags constantly, and does not work as well. Find another tool."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very worst app. No words to write."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for premium when they were starting off years ago Since then I've had to change phone (from iphone to Android) and they wouldn't unlock my paid version on the new phone saying I have to pay again Now stuck with the free version which is full of bugs and constantly crashing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"good app for scanning docs"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After cropping scanned documents image resolution down and brusted."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This used to be a great app, but in the last couple of years it's become inundated with ads and asks you to buy premium almost every other click. Additionally, glitches have made me lose entire scanned documents. Still a good scanner, but hard to use due to all these problems."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Free version is mostly useless. Long ads that have to be ""closed"" 4 times before you can do anything. Paid subscription is way too much for casual use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"So so"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Used to work great, currently only takes black images"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"fain."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. Bad app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not useful without paying a subscription"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I loathe your subscription after charging me initially. And 98% approval? BS! Look at your CURRENT ratings."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Dknt use much"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a couple years. It used to be called scanbot, and it was great. A good simple scanner. I recently opened it after not needing to use it for over a month and MAN does it suck now! You have to watch an ad every time you scan. And now there is a limit to how many pages you can scan into one document, which is 2 pages, unless you want to pay. Not to mention a menu pops up with purchase options every time you click on anything or try to go anywhere within the app. Deleting NOW."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very annoying ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can't open download, it's better not to download without wasting time There are so many ads that nothing can be done"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scans Quickly, Images are good quality and naming suggestions and OCR make for a powerful app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"scanners are one dimensional 180°screen flat correlated to the paper or electronic document being scanned.all ingress and bumps are shownas it is ,only advantage here with a scanned document is the contrast or ink is being recovered in all its clarity ,stored and file transferred units purest form as the original Al done electronically.good scanners do a better job,although the pristineness of the original document is the last lune for scanner output.Flatnesss is scannwr180°>"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It USED to be an amazing app. Now its nothing but spam and adds. You make your document then you have to sit through AT LEAST a 1 full minute add that then leads you down a path to nowhere trying to get out of the add... for the ADD!!!!! Good bye and good riddance"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good Apps ever..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed by time. The application has been far better in the past The advertisement becomes annoying and even the upload / sharing function isn't working anymore. Several attempts via different sources and all of the failed. Also the scan function doesn't work in the first attempt. And now asking for money 👍🏻"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"fast, easy, high quality"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Sanagull"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Its ok bc it can make look clearer with adjustments. However, you cant save it unless you become pro with a high price tag. So, it very limited. Im gonna keep looking. Thanks anyway SwiftScan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazingly good ! Wish to get more features to scan, edit and save purposes which some other apps having recently. Will share you that app's details, if you kinda interested to elaborate yours."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Don't use, ads, predatory monetization (tries to accidentally make you buy things), watermark, low quality images"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Multiple languages for recognition is still the defining feature. Everything else, well it's either on par or worse than competition. I recently tried adobe scan and my God, its UX is just so much better (faster, easier to work with, more tools). This one is going off my phone for a while."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Do not download, app has become a scam. Used to be good."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have used several different methods and apps to save and document receipts and SwiftScan is so far the best fit for me. Scanning, naming and sending files to cloud storage is quick and easy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"privious versions were better. but this app still does it's job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner been using for years and I scan directly into evernote.. the team and the support staff are very good also which is a plus these days"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought the ""pro"" version back when it was a one time payment. I went to reinstall on a new phone and now it is only available as a subscription. This is a nice app, but I don't use it often enough to justify buying it every month."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Baru coba satu dokumen saya harus melewati iklan yg waktunya 1 menit. Sementara aplikasi sejenis lainnya lebih simpel dan praktis. Mending apa ya? Remove..!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Sliders do not allow you to get properly contrasted b&w images with a greyscale filter. edit: and now it's dead completely with its results getting saved infinitely. Used to be great but it's time to move on."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tons of Ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I had given 5 start to this app. Now uninstalled and given 1 start. Highly frustrated with intrusive ads. I scanned 40 pages, and the ad simply won't let me save my work. Ad screen won't go away, and finally had to quit. Taking users too much for granted."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice, straightforward scanning app that does one thing..works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Too much ads now and pro version with a subscription instead of a one-time fee. Bad pricing."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When I went to open a PDF I only have the Drive PDF Reader. Where are you. The Drive PDF Reader IS my DEFAULT READER."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, after wasting countless hours of time, due to SwiftScan's repeatedly failed attempts to produce a single completed scan (not a JPG or PDF). I definitely would not recommend this app to anyone. BTW, the previous name of this app was, ""Scanbot,"" and was literally, THE BEST SCANNER. Their generously low price for upgrading to Scanbot Premium/Pro (via one-time payment) was also extremely cheaper, especially when COMPARED TO SwiftScan's RATES for their SUBSCRIPTION PLAN(S)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"this is exactly what I was looking for. simple to use and can deal with work vs personal receipts with confidence and immediately!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great software"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This deserves a zero star rating. SwiftScan has gone from being a great app to being insanely annoying. Whenever I try to save anything I get an ad for Facebook (which I and everyone else in the world há é had for ever} playing very loud music which is almost impossible to stop or get around. Are they trying to drive users away? I will delete this app as soon as I find an equivalent."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very handy , easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works offline, is good at what it does."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scanning app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a great app to import receipts for expenses and now it's all adds and not functional at all."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Used to be a good app, I even paid to get the Pro version back in the days when it was called ScanBot. Until last year it worked flawless but since October 2021 it no longer works all scans are blurred. Update 13.09.2022 After a second attempt with the support, the app is now working again. I had to switch the scan quality to low, reboot the phone and then back to high. Now it works again. The essential was the reboot in between. It's not enough to only change the settings."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unuseable. Couldn't get past the first ad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Completely useless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Use to be good, now buggy and full of ads"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app was wonderful until recently. Now I can only scan two pages without a paid subscription. So utterly disappointing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"prima app voor bonnetjes in te scannen voor de boekhouding"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Used for time to time file update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"5$/month to do more than 2 pages"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Love the app, use it loads. But even though I've already left a 5* review and paid for the app, it nags me incessantly to leave a review, so I'm reducing my score to 3* until it stops nagging me or gives me the option of stopping all the nagging."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Slow to scan/fails to scan even when perfectly still. Phone heats up. Annoying 2 page limit and full of ads. I will use the regular camera from now on."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Had 36 trackers on me. I never opened it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It was a great scanning app. Now it's full of ads and pro version is really too expensive for casual users."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was amazing then they blocked almost everything behind subscription. It's hardly useable on free version, ads crash and don't allow to save after you spend time scanning. This is not reasonable to ask for subscription for this type of app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can't recognize a paper right in front of it, somehow things text is a UPC code, and rapidly flashes between no document and hold still. Junk app. 9/3/22: Nothing has changed and I wish that whoever programmed in the pop up ads could physically choke on them."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Kak since they are now using ads and forcing you to pay for most using"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Back in the day, this app was pretty good, and it worked fine with only a few annoyances. However, it is now a SCAM. First, you take a picture, coming out blurry Now, EVERY time you try to save a document, you have to watch a loud annoying ad, and then navigate a garbage interface littered with ""upgrade to pro for this basic feature"" to save it and wait (forever now) while it ""formats your document"" (whatever that means). Just use something else, don't waste your time watching ads. DO NOT USE!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, didn't mind banner ads. But they added no kidding 2 minute click bait adds. Then it freezes when I actually waited so I could send myself a document. To bad, used to be good but now uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Die Scan-Qualität ist ok, aber es poppen ständig bildschirmfüllende, nicht wegklickbare Werbeanzeigen für Blödsinns-Apps auf. Sehr nervtötend und frustrierend."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work with Poco m4"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Simple scanning process, the ads are annoying between each scan but for the 5 times a year I have to scan something it works well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Solía ser una muy buena aplicación. Pero su nuevo modelo predatorio lo hace casi inusable por la cantidad de publicidad. Definitivamente una empresa así no vale para pagar la versión de paga. Saco mis documentos y la desinstalo de inmediato.😞😡"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Slow. No filters in free version. If I just wanted to take photographs and make a pdf, there are much better web tools faster than this. It does not scan in the free version, just takes a photo. Even to take one photo and save, it takes around 2 minutes with this app. Better off with the default camera app than wasting time even installing this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantàstic!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Never figured it out."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this app a lot, and if it has ever let me down, I can't remember it."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"22 Trackers!!!!!!!! See Exodus Report. Recently jumped from 5± trackers to 22. I know not if app ownership changed– a severe bait and switch is cause for great concern and violation of trust. I have used Swiftscan for years, especially (and this was one of the major selling points that closed the deal) because the OCR was processed offline (on the device). Another factor was ""buy once"" (as opposed to a subscription). I struggle to give less than 4.4 stars (.6 for 5 trackers)… but 22?!? 2 stars"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Una muy buena aplicación para escanear fotos como pdf. La recomiendo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective scanning tool. Enjoy being able to sync with Nexcloud."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app and experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scanning is quite good but it now completely refuses to autoupload to OneDrive. Revised to one star: now it just crashes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works really well and allows for multipage scanning for free."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Such a disgusting nd useless app😡😡😡😡 I have bad experience with this nonsense app #Swift scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Have to provide an email to use. Ads on start up. Kind of fiddly to use. Have to hold the phone directly over the items, which can be awkward for multiple page documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The support do not even understand the app itself. The app does not create the file name as configured in the name template. It is not filling any coordinates like city, Street etc. And the support has no clue."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use on the go. Definitely like the automatic OCR and cloud saves. With my multifunction printer refusing to scan now that I'm out of printer ink, this app is proving to be a lifesaver."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is my go to scanner. I haven't used anything else since 2017."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It doesn't open any longer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was a good app then they started to force you to watch an unskippable add before you could save your document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's my Go To app for all my important saves"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It seems to work ok but I paid for the pro version and it still only operates as the free version. Customer support never responded."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wicked Quick"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scan app that detects edges and exports to PDF"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"My recent downrating due to a sudden problem preventing changes to the saved scan location, plus file corruption of my SD card, I contacted Maple Media reporting the issue. They helpfully investigated the cause. Having been a Pro user since Scanbot days, changing phones several times, I suspected this as a possible cause. I uninstalled Swiftscan, backed up SD card, reformatted it then reinstalled files from the backup. Then reinstalled SwiftScan. Problem solved with Maple Media's assistance"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use SwiftScan all the time!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Safty"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gray-scale filter. If the gray-scale filter was able to recognize paper, pencil drawings and sketches can look much better. If the black and White filter was applied to recognize paper as it does very well, then the gray scale filter was applied to the strokes, the result might be a proper pencil scan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ak"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"New to app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast and simple to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience with free option! You cannot use the app without viewing and installing some stupid games. They simply make you uninstall the app (or pay high price) after some time. Better to choose another simpler, but fair app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Have to watch unskipable ads to save my own scans... Images are trash, blurry, takes a while, constantly asks for premium. Basically became trash, avoid."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"An excellent tool which has proven itself invaluable, documents can be scanned and sent in seconds. I particularly like the auto shoot feature which leaves both hands free to line up the document. The app has been unusable since the last update, it won't even load 😡"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"this is one of the best apps on my phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Absolutely Horrible service!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Editing from 5 stars to 2. The ads have become so intrusive I'm going to look for another option."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic app I want to purchase the premium version of this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst app that I ever used. This shouldn't be advertised as free because free version does practically nothing. Except for showing the ads. We as users must not tolerate such behavior from developers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Regret buying this. It is very slow and documents often get stuck in the scanning step. When that works, the cloud upload is a total failure and never works. Does not give any error information either. Total waste of time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"? Never worked correctly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Free version is useless as it shows dozens of full screen ads before each action"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Poor app. Does not work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great tool for 80 year old. Excellent Scan results and the ability to send to a variety of destinations swung it for me. Good value app for productivity geeks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ads are ok for a free application, but the long, noisy and annoying videos are unacceptable. I'll look around for another application after longer use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Not perfect, but very good. Can sometimes take a while to focus and autocapture an image. I wish I could configure it to turn on the flashlight as a default. I lowered from 4 stars to 3 because of persistent demands to write a review. Now down to 2 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Free version become an ad infested fest of endless ad streaming, some ads will be unclosable. You want an endless adventure of ads? Install this app, sometimes you might accidentally scan something. Testing the app is very hard, because of ads. Why should I pay for a service I don't know how it serves me? Click something ad. Ads everywhere. It is not usable, I don't see any point in paying money for ads. The display the features of a pro version, but even testing scanning a document, ..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Huh"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use scanner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Enjoyed the free version for years. Loved the Nextcloud upload feature. Now the only thing I really needed is paywalled and the app is chock full of ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I didn't mind the banner ads or the popup trying to get me to upgrade to the premium version. However, now it has multiple loud VIDEO ads that autoplay when trying to scan a couple documents and email them to myself. Absolutely dropping this app to look for another one that isn't going to start loud online gambling video ads out of nowhere."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Lately, the free version is borderline unusable due to the huge amount of aggressive ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The ads are insane w full audio and are tough as hell to get rid of"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Have to pay subscription to scan more than 2 page"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it has been useful for me because I can keep my doc in my mobile when I need it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's amazing 👏"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've used Swiftscan many times and mostly it produces high quality scans. Most of the time I scan A4 pages and sometimes the scans are printed afterwards. This can be cumbersome as I haven't found a way yet to produce scans which are of A4 size in its metadata, so some printers mess up the output."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Does what I need it to do! Great document recognition and overall usability, however the amount of (invasive) advertisements seems to have increased drastically. I would gladly buy this app but I don't use it enough to warrant the subscription, or the (very high) one time lifetime purchase."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ads problem and purchase problem"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great so far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I would like to edit my earlier rating and downgrade to 1 star. I have been using for more than 4 years and offlate, I see advertisements actively playing after each scan and the app doesn't let you save the document until the advertisement is complete. I have found another app and immediately uninstalling this app. I wouldn't suggest this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Privacy invasive. Why do you need access to all the files(data) in my cloud account? Just having access to folder created by the app (& it's files) is enough. But this app asks for complete access to your cloud storage account."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"They added very annoying ads that made the scanning process very laggy on my phone! I will look for an alternative."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So practical"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It worked great for awhile but now it's limited the amount of pages you can have in a document to just 2 & now you have to watch videos before the file will load. This has cost me points in my final exams. If you are willing to pay the $5 of so a month then it works well, but if not then you are much better off finding something more reliable that doesn't limit your productivity without warning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Subscription are very high for lifetime before I saw at one time is 850 for two subscription. When other app available free of charge like Adobe scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The new version doesnot allow us to scan more than 2 pages anymore, unless you pay for that."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Probleme bei der Einbindung von Cloud Diensten. Schade"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used it soo much, from when it was still called scanbot. Used to be quick and easy to use, but now the ads make it unusable, can't get to multiple pages before seeing a pop up again, and after finally getting it to accept my decline the app has forgotten my previously scanned page. Such a shame... :("
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After last update it is unusable due to unskipable ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This is a cool free app.,"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a magical app for homework"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"As with other apps, I downloaded and installed this and then get smacked in the head with the subsription prices. The app developers and Google Playstore aught to bang their heads together and tell us of any prices before making any commitment."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Terrible loud obnoxious ads, can't find the scans"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app used to be good, but now it's 99% ads, 1% functionality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"First time opening the app, instantly shows ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"EDIT: 30-10-2021 I'm still using this app! I've only just downloaded this app, and after using it a couple of times I have to say it is absolutely fantastic. Very fast, easy and intuitive to use. And it seamlessly uploads to my Evernote account. 10/10 - EDIT - 12-02-2015: Ok, I have been using this for a few months now and have recently purchased the pro version. You need to try this app right now! EDIT: Still using this great app it is a must for anyone that wants to scan and store documents!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a excellent app. I've had it for 5+ years & it never disappoints!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"My favourite, since day one, ride or die scan app! I literally just rated it after redownloading...only to find out that it cant scan more than two pages. I am beyond disappointed. 😭"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very much helpful in my administrative work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Best app. Just a bit slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This was my first review - alas!!! Recently im at work swiftscanning a document and for the first time I had to watch a LOUD add for a game!!!! Seriously? I was at WORK!! Everybody heard it and I was so embarrased. Now I am too afraid to use it to take a PDF of patient documents. Ergh!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was my favorite scanning app, if only thanks to the ability to scan multiple pages one after the other, and at the end, the software offers you the option to save as separate pages, or as a booklet. I recommended it to a lot of people but Recently, the loud and incessant ads, have made it completely unusable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I purchased this, and now they want a subscription for me to use an app I already paid for."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A great app to have 😁"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for how long? 5? Maybe 6 years? From when it was still called Scanbot. It worked flawlessly, but nowadays it's a mess. Recently made reviews sum it up better than I would ever would. Switching to the competition now! If you're looking for a new app, don't even bother with this - look elsewhere. P.S.: what about that fake 'X' button to close the ads? Leading to a second ad? Really? Oh man, how nasty is that..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Its rubbish. Not clear and want payment. GTH"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App is now riddled with forced video ads that prevent you from saving. Don't use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Since recent update it's useless. After each scan you have to watch 2 video ads. Video ads also show FAKE CROSS to lure you to click on ad when you actually wanted to close it. It's CHEATING. They also switched to SUBSCRIPTION model...which is unacceptable of course. Yes Yes I know... ""We can still use it for free.."". I understand developers deserve money for their work and I'm OK with paying for apps as ONE TIME purchase for a PRODUCT. I was using this app for many years. It used to be great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be able to use the free version. Now you get a video pop-up everytime you scan something.. Go elsewhere"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I purchased this years ago, before the subscription model. It's unusable now. The technology appears to be the same, but the sheer greed and lack of any recognition for my purchase has locked me into an endless loop of ads and limitations. And the cherry on top is the app begging me constantly to pay $5 per month for something I already bought."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time! 3 problems. 1. It's super slow on Android. 2. Interface makes no sense! I want to finish scanning several pages and only allows me to cancel instead of Save. 3. It's free, but not user friendly with a lot of video ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Has become a must for my company."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I paid $99.99 yesterday for Business Access in the Google Play Store, but your app STILL doesn't recognize my payment. I do NOT have access to all the features of your app, and I'm still seeing lots of irritating ads when I try to use the app. Please fix this ASAP!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Need to expand the screen..... Rest of the features are perfect."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Performance is better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After years of satisfied occasional using. With last upgrade the free version is so overloaded with adds that it became unusable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best one for years"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Almost unusable. And that is too bad. It seems to be a fairly solid program but the pop-ups are so frequent and so hard to dismiss that I usually close the program out of frustration and use my camera app. If I were the developer I would back off the hard sell to upgrade and less invasive paid ads so that users can actually evaluate the features they do have access too. I don't mind paying for an app that offers some utility, but I won't pay for one I cannot evaluate. Too bad!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good work"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's working smartly"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This is a joke. I am being ask to pay for it while i bought my subscription years ago"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy with receipts"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good to me, thanks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Loved the app until the subscription model. I paid for pro version of app years ago and now I no longer have it due to the devs changing it to a subscription service. Will not be paying for a subscription. Will be looking for another app. Shame cause this was great. Greed killed it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app. No fuss and simple. Reduced by one star because of the ads"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The subscription model and the price are a joke."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Best scanner app! My suggestion is : add more choice for customization....... Review updated on 10/04/2022 : I am trully dissapointed with the new subcription which need me to pay monthly. I thought one-time purchase will be permanent. But I'm wrong. It is a waste of money. You paid for nothing after the new subcription model comes. The best scanner app has fallen. Now I'm going for another scanner app. Thanks developer for the good times behind."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After scanning the document, it is put in queue indefinitely and one cannot share it. That's for the paid app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Die App ist eigentlich nicht schlecht auch wenn ich Ordner oder die Vergabe von Stichwörtern vermisse. So richtig nerven tut aber die ständige Aufforderung die App zu bewerten. Früher kam die nur ab und zu. Seit Wochen kommt sie nun jedes Mal! So lange dies nicht entfernt ist gibt es halt nur einen Stern."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"like the app, but keeps reminding me about rating in playstore which i already did. thus only 4 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A refreshing experience. It is not easy to exercise document execution at a distance. I am confident my use of SWIFT SCAN will prove enlightening."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's now 7 months using this app, and I am still in love with it. So, I still love this scanning app. I've used others and like them too but this one is far superior in the end product I get. It's super fast and very easy ri use. It's my go-to scanner! *** Oct 15, 2020 - still living this app. I use it all the time and prefer it to my scanner attached to my PC.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super easy works great 👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Thoroughly enjoyed using the app in the past, easy to connect with cloud services and upload to my PC on the go. After 3 years there are continuous issues that keep arising. Cloud services disconnect/disable now and again and you don't even know when it stops automatically uploading. Poor camera integration a lot of scans end up blurry. From constant setting resets where B&W default filter reverts back to colour with every scan to the Camera Flash integration completely flawed, I have now switched to Adobe's Scanner App. Oh, by the way, don't even bother with contacting Customer Service. I have tens of emails of generic article links they sent me as solutions to all problems. How the mighty have fallen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's good. It does the job. Little slow and clunky and times but way better than any home scanner software I'd seen"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's Good Application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Great App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Am learning how to use this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"With a lg thinq 5g The app is broken and will not save any pdfs or do anything but take temporary scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So long as you have a dark back ground when scanning it works very well and is easy to use turns camera pic into pdf good for o. The spot invoicing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It tries to focus and focus on its own."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was ok before but they now have a 3 page limit thay added which makes the app useless unless you want to subscribe for functionality that should be at base like it used to be."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Was referred over to the app by my brother-in-law and have loved it since! Thanks Al!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great scanning app, until they forced you to pay to remove major overexposure filters when scanning documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and save docs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"A 3-page scan limit is laughable. Uninstalling"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it takes a perfect photo and then smears the document to illegibility. App is now totally useless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't save any scans. Reinstalled and now it won't pull up the paid version. Trash"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Rating reduced from 5 to 1 star. I previously paid for pro and enjoyed using the app but now you have to pay a sub every month if you don't want a watermark. Uninstalled. Now using MS Lens which is better and totally free."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app, now it's resold to a careless developer. Desperately needs feature to apply filters to all images of a document, for equivalent quality throughout document. It's so frustrating and difficult to get a consequent result, even though lighting is the same in original environment and pictures."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wonderfully helpful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I paid for this app a few years back for full unlimited version (no subscription), I had to get a new phone recently and now you want me on a subscription. You need to honour your early adoptors. Good bye!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan app ever"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love this app..it has saved me in so many tight spots where I needed a quick pdf scan on the spot. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have to say that this app powered the last two years of my Uni experience. Thank you for keeping it free while maintaining the necessary tools to scan and upload files. Totally recommend it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"bought it about three years ago now forcing me to subscribe. Why do I have to pay again. Can google provide zero star rating as well ?"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app better alternative of cam scanner ( a Chinese app)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Almost trash. The scan quality is terrible even in pretty good lighting condition. CamScanner or vFlat has way way superior scan quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love the convenience of being able to create PDF scans of documents easily and directly to and from my phone. The FAX service, though rarely used by me, it's also VERY handy when I need it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great so far, once I get through the holidays I'm definitely gonna support the development. Wish I had this App 20yrs ago!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This program sucks now. It used to be fantastic. But features no longer work correctly, and when you ask support about it they say it's no longer supported (yet it's still in the UI???). It randomly loses documents. It constantly nags you about rating it, even if you have. So I'm here rating it, 1 star."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"No encuadra las imágenes no te permite ajustar la tonalidad y calidad de las fotos osea recomiendo otra opción. No se debe cobrar por algo que no funciona como debe ser así de fácil"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy. Love it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Tricky to use and sync with Evernote"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app does the job but it's missing some really basic features that would make it way more easy to use. Would be nice to not have to turn on flash manually every upload. Also hard to get the keyboard to pop up to edit the name of your scan. I have had to change the default file name to a bunch of spaces so that the text box is even clickable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Better than taking a picture"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Working pretty well. yeah."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Consistent dependable existence with this app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy, nourishing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Absolutely despise using this app. Have been using it for the last couple years and no I've had enough. I dread every time I have to scan some documents. I live in a dark ish place that does not get enough sunlight. Here are some of the issues that occur. It's either still too dark or the text blurry. So I turn on the ""flash"". The torch on my phone turns on and I can see everything perfectly. But when I I take the scan the light flashes brighter making a lot of the text invisible. Etc"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Do not buy this app. The service given by the developers is the worst I've ever experienced. I purchased a bundle to include IOS and a link for Android, the Android link stopped working. Ive communicated about 20 times with them for over a month and they refuse to send me a new link even though I've paid for it. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PURCHASE ANOTHER APP. WORST 'AFTER SALES SERVICE' EVER!"

But for the past 2 months I really struggle to take a scan without any blur on tha pages. The app has become from the best to worst! I had to take atleast 5 pics of a page before I get a decent one. Whatever update they did recently, lost my trust with it. I had to uninstall and move to other apps. 3 stars only because it helped me all these years and took good quality scans!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easier than taking a picture and cropping. This automatically takes the picture once it sees a square or rectangular object (document) and saves as a pdf. You also have the option to crop more before saving. Quick!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Last year I gave this app 5 stars. I tried to use it to send a fax today and now can't access PDFs even on my device (my scans used to save to DropBox on this device), and get an error saying that jpegs (my workaround for the pdf problem) on my device can't be accessed from my sd card (they're not on the sd card nor did I select them there).

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very great app for making pdfs from pictures/scans. One thing: It sometimes cuts off a part of the picture/page. To fix that, hit ""crop--->reset""."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Auto cropping is beyond awful, and even when it's ""off"" it isn't off. Email function seldom works, just sits there doing nothing or pretends it's sending and isn't. Attempting multiple email recipients blows its mind altogether. Very mediocre, don't rely on it if you're in a hurry."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have to pay to not use the preset filter. No thanks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awsome"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The developers here have made this application a lot more complicated than it needs to be. It's a scanning app! Keep it simple! Your AI sucks! The automatic photo feature never works well. When I turn that off, it begins auto cropping making my photo unusable. Your auto cropping is terrible! Just let me take the photo. It's not that hard!!!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's a great app love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Smart app. User friendly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app (Scanbot) used to be great at producing quality scans and the filters like magic color and magic text enhance the image and remove unwanted noise. I paid to support the developers since it was good back then. Now that it's rebranded to SwiftScan, the filters are horrible in most scan scenarios and they produce smudges, make text unclear and overall has worse scan quality then free alternative apps. They need to revert whatever they did to the filters in the new version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Disappearance of CamScanner which was good landed me up here and should say I am happier now. Very good application and thank you very much. Best regards, George A P."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app always keeps lagging making work of 10 minutes to 30 minutes. Automatic crop feature never works properly, i have to always crop manually. It takes a lot of time in combination of pages into single documents (PDF). Needs much improvement."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very slow processing app. Automatic crop system is not working correctly & properly. It takes much time in combining of pages into pdf documents. It also become sometimes unresponsive which results in wastage of time."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I expect this app to be better. I'll come back later."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Been using for years now. So easy to use. Love the combined documents feature. I've gone almost completely paperless because of this app. Still loving in 2021!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Decent program to scan documents, so far satisfies"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Awful scan quality. Too many hugs. For example a scan just goes black, or stops working after taping on ""detect"" button."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I like it. Scanned my lease with this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This app has been invaluable for me on the road to save receipts. The ability to upload to Google Drive as either PDF or JPG is excellent. Would like to have a better understanding of what some of the icons mean. This software works great most of the time but sometimes will fail to upload. My last upload had a strange icon that was yellow with a little wave that almost made it look like a yin yang symbol."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice mobile app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Helps so much with documentation that i need converted to pdf quickly if not offered through reg services."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be fantastic, but now unusable. It's impossible to scan a receipt and not have it blurred to uselessness. Sad too since the app was great the last time I needed it. Now a different name and obviously some other changes that simply don't work with my Note 20 Ultra 5G. Fix it and I'll use it otherwise it's gotta go"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app 👍👍👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I am concerned about the name change and the fact that the developer website linked in google play store is a 404. Even though I can find the swift app website, why is it not updated in the play store? I'm pretty sure the dev address is wrong too."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy scanning. Recommended product!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great free app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent scan app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exceptional efficacy"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"App WAS great, then all of a sudden it started taking photos with extreme exposure applied. Scanbot increases the brightness to beyond unreadable when my camera is just fine. Tired using filters to decrease brightness, telling me I have to pay $3.99 🤦‍♂️ will be deleting, thanks for helping me through the first 5 months of corona!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Automatic scan feature is sometimes a little quick to try and identify a page, but generally this app functions as intended. Easy to use and great way to quickly make scans of documents that have been signed/ otherwise annotated. I've used this routinely during telework."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"With Phones getting heavier, scanning documents is a real challenge, because we need to have super steady hands.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have made use of this tool so many times, definitely a great app! My only gripe is how the PDFs are huge in dimensions, around 30""+ wide when scanning a standard 8.5x11"" paper, though this is rarely an actual issue."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent time and space saver! I just refinanced my house and didn't have to go looking for any of my documents because I have them saved to my Google Drive directly from this app. The text recognition has saved lots of time because I can find documents by searching for key words."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I find it painfully slow waiting to be able to download a PDF copy of scans. Microsoft lens does it immediately."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"In combination with the cloud storage upload feature, this really helps me to digitalize paper and get rid of them What I wish as a next feature is to have QR scanning enabled in the settings and just be able to tell the app during the scanning process, that it should read a paper as document even though it has a QR code on it. For now, I need to quit the scanning process and disable the QR scanning in the settings."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow! I just realized that I have been using ""SwiftScan"" (formerly ScanBot) for almost 10 years now!!! I have always been very pleased with the app and have always recommended it to family, friends, and colleagues."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I don't have any opinions yet. I'm going to get back to you on this swift scan app. I am entering the world of mobile banking, and I have installed the swift scan app, after trying out the other apps that are similar. So far I haven't uninstalled the swift scan app after trying out the others, due to the fact that I can get what I need without having to upgrade, and the free isn't a Trail period than subscription price is added.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice usufull apps. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I must say that this app works great. The auto capture and sync works perfectly. One app that does everything as advertised. I've tried so many apps and so many un- installs until I found SwiftScan. Great work to the developers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App got updated and started putting filters on all my scans. Then in order to remove the filter that the app put on it (which in turn made scans illegible and low-quality) payment was required. Cheap and scammy practices."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The pro version on my iPhone works great. This version is terrible, all the scans are so blurry!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Now defaults to colored scan and no option to set a different default. This keeps getting worse."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"- document orientation is often incorrect - background is often visible (was always cropped with scanbot pro) SwiftScan seems to be a massive downgrade to scanbot pro, sadly. Looking forward to fixing updates, the scanbot SDK should have all the features the old app had, shouldn't it?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"super big help.thank you so much"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Dont work gotta download more.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app! 1) It has serious technical bugs. 2) If you pay for multiple copies, you will only get one copy - SCAM Company 3) If you request customer support you will never get a response 4) If you request a refund you will be denied. I reported this issue to Google and they told me to leave this review to make sure other customers are not scammed. I have no idea how it has so many positive reviews. I use an Android phone. I purchased this app for business - it is NOT working!!!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Auto crop is not upto the mark. Need much improvement"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"3-2021 since the recent update, the scan defaults to colored scan. It not longer allows you to save my preferred black and white setting. I scan 30 docs a day so having to manually select black and white for each is quite time consuming. I imagine how little attention the developers are giving this app for such a bug/glitch to make it through the android updates. IMO there is not post-purchase support or commitment to maintain quality with this company. Also spams req. popup For 5 star rating."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but the latest update is scanning to PDF with pages incorrectly rotated at 90 degrees, which makes it totally unusable. Devs: You're missing some unit tests, methinks! Fix it and you get your five stars back. Despite assurances from the devs that they're working on it, this has now been broken for two whole months.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"My Personal Digital Filing Cabinet. I love it. Been using it since it was called something else. I use it to scan all of my important documents and then use it to share to my Google Drive and many other cloud service accounts or physical drives. Just needs to be properly maintaining by the developer and his/her team and try and introduce new features or make this app even more seamless than it already is and it will continue to stay a 5 Star App."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The scans are good and very readable, but the file size is enormous if compared with similar apps. A four page scan averaged 3.2 MB on High Quality and 5.3 MB on Best Quality, which adds up quickly when scanning multiple documents a day. The Medium quality scan, on the other hand, didn't produce a readable enough PDF."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Used to be great but since several weeks scans are involuntarily rotated 90 degrees. The devs have acknowledged the bug but has not fixed it in many weeks. Also keeps asking me as a paid user if I'm happy with a pop-up over and over."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app for mobile"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has been absolutely incredible. On board OCR with a choice of many cloud services for automatic upload.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This loved the app when it was playing nice with Nextcloud, now I'm stuck e-mailing myself scans... Sadly that change makes the user experience poor enough for me to put out on scanning. If a solution is found, then I would be very happy.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Update: months in still no solution yet As other have said the auto capture is garbage and unless yo itu have a perfect black smooth background and a page with clear clear sides on it, forget it. Also every single time you open it will ask you to rate. This is my 5th rating lets say negative five starts. Update: support says it googles fault which is odd as the development team implements the rate me feature/time between asking/ option to turn off."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"इसमें बहुत सुधार की जरूरत है!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Document scanning is easy and accurate. Repeatable workflows that I can customize in the app really speed up and simplify the storage or actions that I need to take with a given document after its scanned. Better than scanning in Evernote, more convenient than a flatbed scanner, and much more functional than taking a photo with my phone alone."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Haven't used it enough to really determine if I like it that well or not seems to be a pretty good app so far the pro version is kind of costly especially because I won't use it that much other than that it's pretty nifty."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it is the only app works perfectly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Takes really high quality pictures to be used as pdf. Only bug I had was for a month or so it wouldn't exit the screen that ties to get you to buy the premium version. If you tried to X out of it it would force you to leave the alp. But it is fine since."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Edit 1 star: Was a great app! for some reason it started to rotate everything to the left... why in gods name would that be happening and with no option to stop it. Original 5 stars: Quite easy to use! I use it constantly for online school"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The processing speed of this app is very annoyable because this app take several seconds after capturing photo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Having similar issues as others. Mainly that the scan quality isn't great, such as the contrast, and white area issues. And that it is rotating pages in PDFs."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So simple. Bought a couple of the upgrades to get automatic uploads to Google Drive. Worth every penny."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It sucks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app is great! However, whenever I try to zoom on the page it throws an error and shuts down the app (on android). It's something to look for."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great for quickly scanning documents with a few pages. Quality is surprisingly good, the recognition of the page and cloud upload could be a little faster, and page recognition works best on clean backgrounds obviously. Still very good performance!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Unable to share pdf on Google apps like Drive, Classroom, Gmail. I have to save it in internal storage then go to the required app and attach file. It's a bit of the cconvinience when you need documents to be urgently uploaded"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"For a free scanner app it's pretty good. I especially like that the page fits to the photo and it's very easy to share afterwards by email etc"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Must have app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The push ad for the pro version blocks all functionality for the free version. It was good for the 3 documents I was able to use it for, but now it's unusable due to the full screen ad that will not let me continue."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Has become literally unusable on my OnePlus 7T. Every time the app starts it basically leaves an imprint of the app scanning screen throughout my device only way to get rid of it is to restart my phone. The imprint shows on my home screen and recent apps screen I can't navigate to any other apps if it wasn't already in my recents. My home screen is completely not visible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"SwiftScan is very helpful in my daily tasks. Don't need a scanner anymore. Just use your Smartphone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Automatic capture is tough to use if you have shakey hands, but otherwise excellent!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is one of those apps that you never knew that you needed, but then found out that you use it every couple of days! It is clean & simple, yet has all the right features & options. Great quality handheld scanner solution!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing. Beyond any expectations. i am fully impressed. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I have to edit my 5 stars review from 2018. All scans are now exported as landscape pdfs. Without a way to fix this, the app unfortunately has become pretty useless since I cannot share these pdfs with business partners."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great product!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Poor automatic background correction. The background and contrast correction used to be excellent, but after the rebranding I've had to turn it off entirely for most scan. Document edge detection still works, but others are better and faster. Live the ability to automatically upload and OCR, but if the basics aren't right, I may have to retire this app. Hopeful an update will fix, but I'm moving to Adobe for now."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. Does exactly what it says."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's SwiftScan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and intuitive app. The free version of the app is useful for personal use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A bit slow to identify the boarders of the scanned document but besides it does a great job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like this scanner app. It's very effective. I've used this and a previous iteration many times. Recommend."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I agree with recent reviews. I have used this app for a long time without issue, but the recent update has left me looking for an alternative. Everything I scan gets changed to landscape mode. Ever try to read a grocery store receipt sideways?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"As others have noted, major quality drop since last update(s) Non sure what happened (maybe a change in underlying libraries?), but the scanning is just not as reliable as it used to be: 1. portrait pages show up landscape 2. text on the page is just worse, with grayed areas etc. Been a happy paying customers for years - hoping the recent problems get fixed so i can upgrade the stars!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app for sure..using the free version for last few years but still works well. Couldn't have ask more from free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Makes scanning effortless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scans have taken a turn for the worse. Every scan now shows some shading where it should be white. In addition to that, the Nextcloud and webdav cloud sync broke. Used to be better!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy n nice."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works great for filling out and emailing documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Thought I could use this to scan my pocket journal sketches but it's terrible at recognizing the pages or at least way too picky, ""perspective"" ""too dark"" freaking had the flashlight on ""move closer"" ""don't move"" just cycles between those for too long to be considered convenient. Turn off the automatic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been using the free version for a while now and it fits my needs nicely. I'm mostly doing quick scans and either share them via WhatsApp or upload them to Google drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Longtime user on both Android and iOS. My gripe is specifically with Android version and haven't tried it in iOS. Whenever i scan a pdf in portrait mode, it will change it to landscape.. this means that my document is sideways when auto upload to Evernote. Cant seem to find a way to counter this"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great, good options"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it all the time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It is looser app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bring back the old version. Swift scan is a complete downgrade."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I'm sorry I paid for this :("
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, one of my best app purchases, but it's no longer worth the money I paid for it after recent upgrade. Despite lots of tinkering with my set up, lighting etc, all the non-text areas of the scan now show up gray instead of white. And all the portrait pages reorient to landscape. I needed to scan an important financial document on a tight time frame and this threw a real spanner in the works for me during an important task. Not good enough."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but lately I've been having some pretty major issues. Firstly, I couldn't connect it to my SFTP drive for direct upload to my NAS no matter what I tried. This finally started working again (although not because of any changes I made). Now, SwiftScan has decided it's going to automatically rotate the pages in a batch of files that aren't supposed to be rotated. I'm scanning in A4 portrait, it's rotating to A4 landscape but only when the PDF is being created."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Worst thing about this app is that it take whole life to load the document after scanning. Please improve I'm paid customer."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great to transfer old photos to digital with precise cropping function"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of best apps. Since the rename and some updates they are ""looking into"" several bad bugs (orientation, review banner, nextcloud/webdav,...) nothing changed so far. Support is nice but not helpful cause only telling the same story over and over again: devs looking into it. Also its not like being a free app user, wanted to support the premium way but ask therefor also for not only free app support quality! Getting rid of an annoying review banner since months for premium users: no!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent reproduction!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good quality scans. Very happy overall. Managing uploads could be more transparent, but nothing that would keep me from recommending SwiftScan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fast. Great program."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best scanner I've used. I even got rid of my multi function machine because I can scan and print anything using Swiftscan. I set it up to automatically upload to my PC and use it daily in my office."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Stinks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"2019-08-13 - Scans well, images are clear, filters are easy to use and useful. Plenty of useful functions for file management. Although I can't get the OCR to work consistently, which is the reason I wanted to use it. Seems to get stuck on ""Recognising Text"" and never completes. (Never is a harsh word, but I waited 3-4 hours so it's a fair assumption I feel. ) 2019-11-25 - Any word on the OCR fix? 2020-12-29 - Seems to be fixed now"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have used few other scanning apps that comes with cloud storage services, but this app definitely knows how to make clean scans, OCR well, and other features like combining files uploading to cloud. One of the best app purchase I made."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Incredible. Document sorting and scanning has never been this easy. It anand the borders automatically and gives you the best possible image. Also had multiple export options."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I'm pro user & I think the app is still in very nascent stage of development. Image Filters do not work properly, giving pathetic scan quality on reprinting of documents. There is no option to sort documents in folders, you just get a long list to spend time in choosing from it, its too annoying. Development is also slow, and no new features are being introduced to catch up with changing times. No efforts are being made to harness improving camera specifications on devices."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great appp"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Asks me to rate the app every time I use it which is frustrating when I have already left a very good review, untill now.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Quality drop since recent update. The scan is also now doing a poor job reoriantating the scan. The words look warped on the edges. It appears I'm not the only one experiencing problems.. hope they find a fix since I have purchased the pro version. The words, ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" come to mind when using this app now. They should've left things alone. It was almost flawless and a pleasure to use. I would pay 3x's as much for the previous version if I can get it back."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Quality is lacking compared to alternatives. If you aim for white backgrounds you can forget readability, as well as picture quality. Alternatives do this better and also faster. Only good point to alternatives is, that you can edit the scan afterwards"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended for when you need to scan 1 page only and your no where near a printing machine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can't connect to any webdav or next cloud service."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Quick, easy, great clarity!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Nextcloud integration is broken since more than half a year. Also no fix with 7.7.3."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I really used to love this app, but now it has a real problem focusing & I've got a Google Pixel, so it's not the phone or its camera. My wife has the same problem with her Galaxy S10. Used to be that this app only took a few seconds to frame and shoot but now it can take a VERY long time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I can only scan not able to open any other options"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy, handy and convenient tool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"As yet, the app has performed as expected. It's easy to operate and does what I want it to do. Thanks."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Top"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 if I want pestered to give a review or buy pro after every scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"automatic cropping is a bit wonky but the app works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, name and send"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great except when you are trying to scan a doc that has a QR code on it, it keeps interrupting to try and copy the QR code URL. You should be able to dismiss this and just scan the page."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I WANT TO GIVE 0 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRASSHSHHSH TRASHSHSHSHSHSHSH!!!!!!!!!! WHYYYYYYY CANT SHAREEEEEEE THE DOCCCC TRASSHSHSHSHSHSH"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Been waiting over 1 hour for a document to save only send to have happened recently, not exactly ideal if you have to send an urgent document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exactly as the app name indicates, it is a quick, effective and efficient way to create a PDF that can be emailed or shared instantly. Love it you guys! Keep up the great work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Crashes on Chromebook. The app name is registerd trademark of anpther company. The website has no information on what the terms of purchase are."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Juatvwhat i need"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very bad."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's suitable for simple, not perfect, scanning. It could be annoying if you want perfection. I think you have to consider the physical setup first to have a better result. It's easy to share."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Really hard to get the page perfect youre either to far to close not straight"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Failed on some"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good scanner but the output option is only pdf"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it is simple to use and delivers its promise."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Update: Rating dropped from 5-star to 1-star. Android 11 made some big changes to the Scoped Storage functionality that Google began to implement with Android 10. One of the biggest user changes is removing access to the ""Android/data"" folder. SwiftScan places all scanned files in the net.doo.snap folder within the ""Android/data"" folder. As a result, it is now impossible to access the image files with the Android default file manager, and programs such a BoxSync cannot access and upload the images created by SwiftScan. While the Advanced Settings within SwiftScan allow you to view the file path of the storage location, you cannot change the path This is a significant issue that needs to be promptly addressed to restore user functionality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful for a quick scan of a document. Can save files direct to cloud."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great working with this app. It worked seamlessly with all my other apps as my documents and email add ons."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Dropped in quality since rebranding to swiftscan. The autoediting is a little worse, and when converting to pdf, constantly makes it in landscape despite taking the image in portrait. When uploading my documents, I have to take an additional step to rotate my pdf on a website."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fast. Does what I need."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Been using the pro paid version for a couple of years now..good! Highly recommended!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's free and good quality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"An excellent app that has the range of functionality I need. Its biggest rival is probably MS Office Lens, which is snappier, slightly more stable, and sometimes produces better results with document edge detection and OCR. I prefer the sharing and upload in this app, though, so currently this is always my first choice."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing, using daily for construction contracts"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for scanning business cards, receipts and documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its better but the loading is the problem but nice work <3"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scans,saves,auto uploads all for free. 5 stars. Update. Still 5 stars! Awesome."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Terrible user experience. Auto modes always reads for a QR code, while also bombarding user with camera angling instructions. Once finally scanned pdf manipulation is 0 stars and unintuitive. Waste of time better to get a different app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app for capturing images"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Moo"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"One of the best scan apps for Android and very probably worth the price, but plus features can't be tried before you purchase the full version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works like it should. Nice user interface."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be perfect for my needs. I would scan a couple of pages and it would upload those to the cloud. Now has degraded performance. It doesn't capture properly part of the time; sometimes all it captures is capture a black rectangle. Luckily restarting the app usually solves this, but it's rather disappointing coming from an app that used to work perfectly. Another annoyance: it demands a review everytime you start it. Update: downgraded to one star because it keeps begging for reviews."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Like it a lot!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I have already purchased scanboat pro but its not showing in my purchase list...pls help me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Minus 1 star because this app keeps on asking to be reviewed. Annoying."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Please stop asking for reviews. Fist gave 5 stars now 2, it is getting very irritating"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use... 😊😊👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not bad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use L"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. Works very well in all lights and surfaces. I use it a lot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and comes in very very handy on the go"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanning app with a lot of powerful features. Works well and has a good UI. I found out recently there is a multipage mode that makes scanning so much faster. Thanks to the devs. BTW I would love to know why the name was changed (copyright?)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No best quality scan!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It takes a little too long to make the scan even when the lights on sometimes I get a no light. I paid for this app so for the love of God please stop asking me to review it every single time I open the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Like the easy to upload feature"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not good in use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I've reviewed the app two times. It keeps asking me to review it. Every time it asks me to review it, I'll remove a star. Please fix this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's a good app I use for scanning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works pretty much as described. It would be easier if I use a tripod but I don't normally have a tripod in my pocket for my phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its an excellent piece of software. But I wish the page detection was fast."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Love it. Only draw back is that it takes a bit of effort sometimes to capture images."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Steady hands give nice scan 👌"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very cool app i recommend it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy!!!!!!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really good scan quality, but slow to capture in automatic mode"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to turn my hand-drawn diagrams into clean images in jpeg and pdf, putting them into my Google Drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Forced me to buy the upgrade even tho the free version supposedly is unlimited scans. It would load the you should upgrade screen after I did 10 documents. I clicked skip and it went right back to there. Reloading app brought the screen back up. Its not free if you use it too much."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"4 stars for consistently asking me to review the paid app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, pretty straight forward"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great user friendly app, lifesaver when working from home!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I tried combining some documents I scanned with this app to some normal pdf's. Every document that was sscanned using this app was oversized from 8.5x11. A most annoying thing when you're trying to compile a package together. A check of settings doesn't indicate whether you can change the sizs of the scan. That makes this app unserviceable and doesn't work correctly with pdf format. The app is slow too. And I paid for this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app but haven't gotten the paper scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"dsm. Sms email. Vov. At. On play in vox. #"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Generally pretty good, 5/5"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time .. wish the auto focus was better but it might be my phone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect for scanning and emailing files from anywhere"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The scanning of documents is very good, but the documents are saved as large memory. There is a compression option, but the compression process is very long. Taking 10 minutes or longer to reduce the size of a 4 page document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's good but it's the expensive and I have already buy with the iOS account but I can't use it here this is the problem"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ใช้งานได้ดีมากๆ"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Flawless. Very easy to use, easy to save, and somehow this is all free!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Add new features like Shadow removal and defect cleanup ,night or amoled dark themes on your next updates. Thanks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I've tried a lot of scan apps and this is the one I keep going back to. Works great! Although sometimes you have to hold it longer to get it to capture the document."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"V.good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The only app you need to scan your files. Recommended !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good app It needs 2 more feature - Editing or replacing the page after scanning and combining a lot pages - auto detecting the range of the document need improvment or letting the user to scale the range"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Execelente aplicação. Facilita muito a digitalização de documentos, imagens, etc. A mecânica de ajuste de corte de imagem ajuda muito a ter digitalizações mais limpas."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"No pop uo adds, easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I seems good but I really dont know because I have to pay money to be able to see how good it really is. So, it gets two stars for false advertisement!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Keeps prompting for a review no matter how many times I dismiss it. I paid for this app, I shouldn't be bombarded with what's basically an ad"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good for small things, but don't expect professional quality on full pages."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Since lockdown in March I have been using swiftscan instead of the office scanner, after 8 months I am still working from home and I never thought of using anything else but this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple and lots of share locations. Some themes I like are in the paid version but this does the job. I like the crop version too"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is how we keep the profiles in order cool thank you Windows and Apple and Microsoft cool you guys are awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and convinient"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanning the document should be improved and the picture quality is good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Such a useful app in these lockdown times"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scan pro has been pretty helpful in digitizing documents. Sometimes it's extremely difficult to get enough light on the documents to avoid a ""too dark"" warning, though, even with a full spectrum lamp shining directly into it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Several functions have stopped working with some of the last updates, but it's still one of the best for my use case."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Solid ,dependable, handy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Coming from Camscan I find this app less intuitive. The quality is not as good but for the price it is tolerable. I would increase my rating if you could have folders"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Fast n easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy and quick"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"too slow"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"a workhorse of an app, simple to use. turns my phone into an office."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is probably one of the best, if not the best pdf scanner in the Play Store. Very easy to scan, supports OCR and sharing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and good quality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like the App. Great for sending my documents. My only problem is sometimes it jumps to the QR code when a document doesn't have one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very bad don't download you can't take proper pictures this is my experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"i want to give half star but option not available bahot he chutiya app haaa"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good Scan Apps, No Watermark"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It autoscans on edges detection and auto uploads to various cloud storage. I just wanted an app that does this two things correctly without a monthly subscription (tried a few dozens before ending up here, there's too many apps requiring pressing a button to scan) Only comments: - auto detecting edges is a tad slow on my pixel 4a, but it's not unbearable. - edits and edges can't be adjusted after saving a document. I was spoiled by scanner pro who does it on iOS, nothing critical though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best useful app. I use it very often for scanning my docs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Overall very good, but it would be nice to have more robust editing options such as adding pages from other documents, add text, etc. Otherwise, no complaints - simple, straightforward, and it works."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. Has helped me so much and easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"For a few months now the app is quite unusable. It crashes all the time. Sad, was very good till then."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"You are the best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So easy to first use and offers flexibility at the same time!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, and with good quality output. Have been using it for more than a year."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far so good. There is just a bit of delay after taking the picture and scanning it but it is manageable. Hope it will continue to serve its work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Indispensable for home and work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best one yet. Clear texts nothing blurry"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works well but it constantly begs for reviews. I may end up subtracting a star if this continues."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Didn't work well at all for my application. Documents were very sharp and detailed until I cropped (which needed to be done to every one with this app), after which, resolution went to zero. Documents were no longer legible. Adobe scan worked so much better for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"superb!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been trying to get over how much the cost of this app I like it a lot why so much money"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, I use it all the time. This is a must have: for all the times you need to sign a document to send and aren't near a scanner; for archiving documents it is so much quicker than putting pages into a scanner; for keeping an easy to find record of a document you need... throw away all the paper you would otherwise have kept. Quality always great as the image is refined as needed. I use the free version, haven't need more."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great tool to have on your phone, quick, easy & free to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It really works well. Have not had any problems. Good that you can crop after scanning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It works pretty well, especially for a free app. It does sometimes take a long time for it to find the page but again...its free."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good and the best scanner in your palm."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works great. But very sensitive to phone movements"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It becomes too long to focus and scan making the task very difficult."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Pls stop permanent requests for rating"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have all my documents scanned and uploaded to the location I want. Great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Why is there no option to make the PDF a standard a4 size? I need to manually edit it on my computer every time just to have a correct size. Also it sucks that you can't use compression by default. I always need to do it manually and it takes ages."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Its good but basic one free and not bad when use it begging money"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"makes me feel like im doing smarter and im in the right place for once lifes great its a wonderful app tells me usful information on other apps which i never knew about till now thank you scanpro"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not the most amazing app but it does the job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very convenient 👌"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"it asked me to rate it every single time I use it and makes me click through three times every single time I use it. I have the paid version. I don't expect to deal with this when I pay for it. I will give you one star until you change this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Use it all the time for work when scanning signed packing/receiving slips back to our main office. Taking off a star as if there are any barcodes on said slips, the app often attempts to open a url instead of just scanning to PDF which can be frustrating at times."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple easy to use mobile scanner app! Still great after over a year of use! (Updated 10/23/20)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Decent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Could not get it to work on auto-mode and in manual mode, it cut off huge chunks of the to and bottom of the document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its a great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for scanning and sending documents on the Go!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I now seem to be forced to choose for an upgrade and can no longer access my files. When I select Continue, select Free (or 0€) it brings me back to the upgrade screen again. Same when I select Skip. Lost in this loop, my files no longer accessible .. Settings not accessible: gone is the initial joy of using this app. Perhaps it should never have changed ownership ..? But I still want access to my scanned files ..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Stop asking me to review!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Have to pay no option to skip"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good tool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Updated review! It's difficult to scan multiple pages. I did 27 pages all SCANNED,. Sir, after so many repeated attempts to reach to you for scanning of multiple page, sstill not getting any response. You are tempting me to flag it as an inappropriate app. Instead of providing with any satisfactory solutions, you provide with other medium which are unsatisfactory. Updated review! Drastic quality improvement is required!! Think many times before purchasing Pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst aap I have ever used. I'm not joking it is seriously a worst app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Precision scanning makes the document scanned appear to be the original. This app is a ""must have"" and should come preinstalled on all phones."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Handy little scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Works but takes a lot of maneuvering to get it to take the scan. I get a lot of no document, don't move messages before it will take the photo and it seems that 1/2 the time it thinks it is a qr code. Device is a Samsung galaxy 8+. It seemed to work better before some software updates"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is a bit annoying because whenever I take a picture half of the picture is visible while the other half is not even there. Sometimes the picture comes blurry too...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Nextcloud export not possible and even after weeks no fix"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app basic features do the job well. Does try to repeatedly get you to upgrade while you're in the middle of trying to hold your phone still to scan something which is annoying and wastes time but overall that hasn't stopped me from sticking with it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Barely works."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. You get unlimited scans. They do have more options which they do not bug you about. First level - free Second level - $ 9.99 Third level - $ 14.99"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good free app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Opened my paid app and you guessed it!!!... Prompted for another review!! It sucks, and continues to suck. Stay posted for my next review It still sucks. Every time you launch the app it prompts you for a review. So I'm going to oblige and keep giving you crappy reviews till you fix that annoying problem. Don't buy this app!! There's better ones out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unusable because of the adds and payment screens"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I tried many Scan apps but this is the best. It is for free, makes good scans and synchronises with Dropbox, that is a huge benefit! Highly recommend!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"09/2020: Leider funktioniert seit einiger Zeit der Nextcloud-Upload-Service nicht mehr. Die Anmeldung bei einem Server ist nicht mehr möglich. Die Fehlermeldung lässt vermuten, dass das WebDav-Protokoll falsch implementiert ist. Gute Qualität der Scans, Scannen funktioniert einwandfrei. AutoUpload ist auch super. Features, die ich mir allerdings noch wünschen würde: 1. Beim AutoUpload Speichern in Unterordnern, vllt abhängig von verwendeten Tags 2. Funktionsreicheres automatisches Benennen"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, super intuitive and easy to use. Have tried several including the one in Google Drive, but this one's better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!! Easy to use with great results!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The ui sometimes not very easy to use, but it is very possible that it is the best. The functionality is awesome. Detection usually works very well. The only flaw it sometimes detects baroda or qr code which is not on the paper"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND ITS SO EASY TO USE"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is ad ridden trash. It was a normal app until it got sold, and the new owner apparently is running a very aggressive way of trying to shove a subscription down your throat. Let me buy the premium features once and we'll talk."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to handle, high resolution photos"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, works like a charm!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"👌 awesome app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, I keep all my files on my phone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's good but sometimes it doesn't recognise the document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Update: The app is almost becoming almost unusable. It takes forever to detect a page and then bunch of instructions follow like move closer, don't move and then no document detected and then the whole process again. Old review: The new version is so pathetic. My default camera app takes better scans than this app now. I wish I hadn't paid for this app. The only thing it is supposed to do is only very poorly done. I hope they fix it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for scanning on the go!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super app. I use this app to scan many types of different documents and it works well."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Such an easy program and helpful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful tool that creates documents to be easily emailed anywhere needed!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not at all appropriate,no compressor as a result PDF size is very big ,so most of the time cannot be uploaded to any social platform .And moreover it's a premium app in disguise,so I would recommend not to use this app at all.Pdf quality is also bad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Stupid"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good program. Naming and saving files could be more use friendly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use the pro app constantly and paper magically disappears from my life. My only concern is that I am unable to switch between Google Drive accounts to store my files."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app is amazing and all. But I bought a package for premium for me and my wife. And the other code doesn't work on my wife's phone. And I tried to contact the support a million time but no one replies. So basically ripped me off (even though I'm sure it's not the intention. But the result is the same)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works for a few business receipts every once in a while"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazingly clear scans that can easily be turned into pdf"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"My phone is a Galaxy S8. I purchased the paid version of ScanPro roughly 18 months ago. At some point in the last 6 months they made an update that SIGNIFICANTLY slowed down all functionality on this app. Prior to that it worked perfectly, everything was fast. Now the app opens slowly, scanning is slow and doesn't seem to hold edges very well. Cancelling a scan takes 20 seconds, processing a scan about the same. Saving a scan takes longer. Literally everything about this app is slow. All the other apps on this phone work fine so I'm 100% positive it is not the phone. The app is almost to the point of being unusable. I loved it when it worked, and used it for everything, but now I'm very disappointed. I guess it's time to move to something else."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ScanPro has been such a great time saver."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very good"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good app but not best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scanqualität sehr gut ( ähnlich wie bei ""Adobe Scan"" ) Kein Wasserzeichen Keine Werbung ( ads ) Nervige Hinweise auf verfügbare Upgrades Lokale Speicherung erst wenn in die ""Settings"" - ""advanced Settings"" - ""storage location"" ein Speicherpfad gesetzt wird.. Oder nach dem Scannen auf ""More"" - ""Internal storage"" Erst dann wird nach den Recht zum Speichern auf dem Gerät gefragt ( Android Meldung )"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Does a good job."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"So I do like this app, its great when it works. The page detection and warping repair is really accurate, and its clean and simple to use with direct uploading to every service you can think of. The problem is that upon installing the app, I can get maybe 3 or 4 good scans before documents start coming up as black sheets, with the message ""document was removed"" and giving the option to ""recover document"" which never works. The only way I have found to fix this is to uninstall and reinstall."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Many Documents are stuck in ""processing"" forever. If i need a quick scan, this is particularly frustrating."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great. Very efficient."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great help to get rid of the piles of papers that you normally build. Just store everything in the cloud. Perspective correction is more professional when sharing documents."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Functional product but there are continuing nag screens for rating and additional purchases even after buying this.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"تمام برنامج ممتاز"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. But autodetect of page borders could be faster. App works better on iOS devices in that regard. Colour scans are highly saturated / illegible."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"muy buena aplicación funciona correctamente y escanea súper bien"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool. Small caveat... This is not a substitute for a monochrome photocopier. Images captured with ScanPro and printed monochrome tend to come out darker than output from a regular photocopier."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful to scan and upload documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Had the app for years and it keeps getting better and better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Allows a very efficient workflow, works stable and without any issue, thank you for development"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Have been using it since 2018, used to be good, but became worse and worse with every update. Key complaints: - Scan only work half of the time, post-processing times out at roughly every other attempt. - Got more and more sluggish and battery-draining with every update. - Keeps asking to rate the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for Scanning Documrnts"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"highly recommended easy to use, easy to share scanned docs via email, text, etc...seamless integration with Google Docs allows you to save scanned docs in your google Drive in 2-3 clicks"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scan app. Connects to google drive, which is extremely convenient."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent scanning app - integrates well with the cloud services I use and is reliable in its scan quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to pick up, easy to use. Huge filing help."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A very useful app, I highly recommend it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Used to use CamScanner which at some point became a CamScammer bringing a virus with one of the updates. Interface of this app is much less clogged and easy to use. Worth the money."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not the best app. I wish there were options to choose whether you want to scan a document or a QR code. If a document has both, it only scans the QR code and not the document. Scan quality is bad in angled scans. I believe this app would be great if these errors could be fixed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin. Takes pictures of receipts easy to set the file name and saves them to my one drive. Happy days"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I tested a bunch of different scanner apps and think this one takes the best quality scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The fax service didn't work. The scan app works good, except you need to work on the automatic perspective. Typically never gets it right. And yes, I use a black background and everything. So far works well, but needs a little more work"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gd scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good way to make plus. Although at times it will take a while until it registers on your phone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use, good results. Good options for sending and sharing. One tip for users who are getting poor scan results - TURN OFF FILTERS. You can only reach this setting after you have scanned an image. Default setting for me was black and white, giving awful results when scanning a colour screen. Once filter turned off scans are in colour and really good."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanner app. Recently I get a pop-up asking me to review the app after every scan. Seems like a bug. Is there a way to disable them feature?"

I also love that it will auto upload it to my Google drive so I can keep things organized with all my work files. My only disappointment is the magic text and magic color sometimes make the text unreadable. I usually use gray scale or no filter. I love this app!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scan quality is good but not great. Otherwise, app has functionality to backup and restore through cloud, delete the files after backup to save phone memory and to send fax. Suggestions: 1. Ability to use system camera for better scan quality. 2. Ability to create folders for organising the scanned files."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far quite good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was hard to get this to focus on document to scan. Downloaded another free app that was simpler to use."

Updated. Scan bot responded quickly to this issue. They were wrongly flagged as a trojan and within 24-48 hours they had the issue corrected. Well done. changing to 5 stars. Works well but now being flagged as a trojan and telling me they are going to steal my banking info. ScanBot needs to address this issue and provide a safe app."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really like this app because both automations like auto-scannig or auto-cropping and customisation features like colour editing or manual cropping works fine. UI is very intuitive so it wasn't confusing at all to find all the features I'd expect from an app like this. ☺️ Sharing and exporting scanned docs (even PDFs with multiple pages) is a piece of cake. ✌️ Scanning quality is also great. So I'll keep this app on my phone as one of the smartest utilities for sure."

I use it daily for work and it creates clean, crisp, printable B/W copies that I can upload easily to my Drive, email, & more. Super easy and simple to use. Saves as PDF or JPEG. I like that I can opt-out of saving to the cloud since I process sensitive documents. I don't know what I'd do without ScanPro!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The app combines great design in what it can do with flexibility on what it can be applied. Document and image scanning is a useful tool and there are plenty of mediocre examples, but Scanbot has made a great one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I demand a refund! I bought this Pro version of this app just today; I cannot use the OCR, cannot import pdf. I have granted far more permission for an app in the Playstore, and keep getting the prompt to purchase this app AGAIN"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Are you fricking kidding me!? Why can't I crop? And I paid for the pro feature! This is absurdity!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Does this work for blue coloured pen?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the best pdf editor which was useful for me. I wanted to make my pictures to pdf but all the other apps where only allowing to change 5 photos; and were asking money to edit more than 5 photos. But this app allowed me to upload all my photos to pdf freely. It is very fast, and we need not spend much time waiting for it to download. I will sure recommend this appbto you."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Can you please add the ability to organize scans into folders?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not work properly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I've reliably used it to scan all my hand-written work for university for over 2 years now. The app is functional, very easy to use and FREE!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Just one thing is missing from this app is after scanning can't able to reorder pages"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your data I wint even let you use filter without buying premium most stupidest app I've seen this year"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst app l have ever used. Doesn't even work properly at the first photo itself"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great options"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"SCANPRO - A truly superb Scanner and OCR App ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I have had this app for some few years now, comfortably running on all my android as well as IOS (both iPad & iPhone) devices and its been a breeze. It is handy, simple & easy to use, but simple doesn't mean it is too basic, no! Comes packed with lots of useful features! Love the ease with which I can switch from android to IOS and still access all my documents, edit, scan text, compress etc. I happily give it 5/5"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I think scanPro is best Document Scanner app after camscanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Makes life very easy i love it good job with this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not working Just after install, it ask for email id, on entering an email id it showing an error. Pls resolve asap."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Transitioning from CamScanner, the first thing I miss is the ability to organise files into separate folders. The starting page that I am presented with seems to be to unorganised and cluttered. I have the VIP subscription so that's all the more disappointing. Please fix this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"To use any filter / effect, you need to pay. This is a basic functionality which other apps offer for free. I don't understand why you made all of the effects locked. So I am giving it 1 star."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very poor dont like just mad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nicej"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Nice app but it is too much slow and the file size is to big I think they have decrease the file size and faster process"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Romantic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple i love it you should try this one guys"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Has some great features, but some basic functionality is broken or not working as expected: ##### Automatic detection of page content (grayscale, colored, ...) is quite often wrong. ##### Automatic thresholding of black/white documents is often suboptimal (there are dozens of algorithms which tackle exactly this problem and they do a great job if applied correctly). ##### Manual corrections to the image parameters (brightness, contrast, saturation) are still a miracle to me: unpredictable and different from the well-established standards used in other apps. This could be the perfect app for the job if these issues are being fixed. Please, developers, go for it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Nice app but isn't working properly. When I started using it, it scanned perfectly, now is slow and doesn't recognize the page. Also a question: is there a way to create a draft to which I can later add pages, delete pages and, more important, modify the cut and the filter? If I open the document after finishing it, I see a pencil button at the right bottom corner but it doesn't do anything.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesomeness"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless. Takes too much time in the name of processing documents. Scan then wait for 25 minutes until it recognizes text & completes processing of the documents. Hate it, uninstalling."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Awful. Seems like an easy concept, capture what's on the screen. Not at all for this app. Cuts off half the page half the time. QR reader pops up for no reason every second or third page. Time consuming and frustrating. Not recommended unless you want to feel like throwing your phone across the room, yelling at your family unnecessarily and kicking the cat. I'm not a violent person and don't have a cat."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Used to be good, but since the update it can't identify documents at all. Even white paper on a black background it get confused and recognises a border in the black background that isn't there and then skews the image to fit this nonsense. Totally rubbish."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The privacy policy is outrageously broad and totally unnecessary. I had really loved the app before it turned into spyware."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super handy and always works great :) thanks!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"You should at least allow users to OCR 10-15 pages to test for accuracy. How can you expect users to believe accuracy would be high enough to pay for premium without testing it out?"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Powerful app. Essential tool for home & work. Social-distancing-friendly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Helped me a lot for my homework assignments. My papers looked way more proffesional."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Cannot recommend due to the excessive permissions requested of cloud storage. It's a shame because Scanbot is great at automatically detecting document size, filtering photos to make them more legible and reasonable OCR. However the app requests full permissions to all of my OneDrive, not just an app specific folder as is standard. This was a conscious design decision on their part and unfortunately something I can't accept."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Auromatic option useless. I never able to use it. It says too close or too dark .. horribke. I repent for subscribing premium vertion."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not good at all. You need to improve a lot in this app. Sorry for giving one star please 🙏 improve. I know it will be best app in a future."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App is sluggish."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have reached out to thw developer several times now and No response... I would give it 5 for all its functionality except it is lacking in a VERY significant area... I bought the PRO version and despite it all I can NOT import a prexisting PDF or DOCX file, add after Saving like a multipage pdf scanned in it would not let me take a page or two out BOUGHT 27$ worth of FAX tokens and it crashes every time I try to fax.. Big drawbacks in my book. If the Developer will get a hold of me..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scans won't save to device. I've tried over and over with different scans and nothing ever saves."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Nice app but OCR is useless in that it is about 50% accurate on a Costco receipt. I regret purchasing this as there is no demo. Don't buy if you want to use OCR. Also the search only matches beginning of words so it doesn't work well when OCR can't scan an 'A' character. Update Apr 2020: OCR quality is much better now but search still only matches the beginning of words."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not work properly at all. Cannot view the pictures while changing its order. It evern takes a lot of time to load the images"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great and so effective."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I have tried multiple scan apps. This one is the best. Best quality picture. Easiest to navigate."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst... I just bought the in app purchases for 1400rs but it was not so good. I would like to get a refund"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Just another coder who took my money. The app is now only available for iOS."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It was good . Now its trash . App did great when I first downloaded it. Was working perfect until you started updating the app. It doesnt scan good no more, it cant see the paperwork even with it being bright, and when it does scan it's only half a page or entire picture leaving nasty dark spots. So close to uninstalling it . Glad I'm not paying for it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic job 👏"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The new privacy policy states use of an enormous amount of data, and includes the transfer to an extensive list of 3rd parties. No mention is made of whether the same data is collected from pro users."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Free version quality is terrible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app will not even let me move past the welcome screen because I refuse to pay for the app. It gives you a free option, but if you choose the free option then it tell you ""sorry, and error has occurred."""
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I've changed this from a five star rating. Scanbot used to work flawlessly, fast in focus. A few years ago the speed went away and now I have to hold the phone over the document for a very long time while it finally gets a focus and takes a picture. And just lately it won't focus at all and it saves a blurred document that is useless. Uninstalling, moving on."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very bad .. noting but only for taking pictures in free mode..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's alright so far,,, the free version, that it's..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Having to pay for those features is ridiculous"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and it has all the features you need for convenient scanning and uploading"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Its ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Simply good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Colours filter sucks. Free version is work well i not recomment to buy a pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great App allows you to send it to word so you can edit the text on any documents!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"that's good. But hungry for money...🤑🤑"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Wont werk"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Not for sure if i had any success with this thing, but im not sure if i had any failures because of it either. Definitely had some fails while i had it though. Those failings had nothing to do with this app though. It is what it is."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I really expected so much more from this with all the high praise in the description. It fails to mention how unless you pay for the premium service the only option you can use out of all those super cool features that it lists is unlimited scans. That's right. I pay for premium apps but when it enhances an experience. Not when it forces my hand to use it. There are some great scanner apps that are customizable and free and sync with accounts that I recommend over this insulting free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I haven't been able to use it as it keeps saying that a subscription error occured. Please help!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Doesn't do what it has to and when it does, it disappoints"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Pages are automatically trimmed..... Worst experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Too hard to locate the scanned files"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"New privacy policy gives permission to use sensitive personal data. They are giving themselves permission to use your social security number and anything else you scan. Disgusting abuse of privacy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works well so far!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No trial? I'm not paying $20 if I can't evaluate if it works first."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"😎👈"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app amazing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Never downloaded this app one day it just appeared on my phone have no idea how it got there and I would not suggest putting it on there if because there's something fishy about it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The updated privacy policy concerns me. They collect too much data. I want to know if they collect so much personal info from pro users. Also scanbot needs access to all of my google drive files, when it should only have access to its own files."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"As a paying customer who bought pro I was buy some of the quality of pictures and I went to Google after which I had a long without using scanbot. After coming back to access I'm the content I have stored on scan bot I'm disappointed to find it is all gone. I'm glad that I left."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After recent update my phone informed me that scanbot uses camera in background. I am not sure whether this change has something to do with Scanbot being sold to Maple, but I rather uninstalled. Before it was best scanner I tried but with new owner I am afraid what they do with my scans and also camera."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is a great app. It makes it easy to take high-resolution, crisp scans from photos. With a little tweaking, you can make color scans to preserve colorful images; or if legibility of a document is what matters, you can take space-saving black-and-white scans. It's easy to make multi-page documents. I can easily scan and send receipts, which makes travel for work easier. I believe this is the best scanner app available, and definitely worth paying for the Pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Having problems subscribing due to an error. If it gets fixed 5 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Previously a great app, but the new privacy policy looks like I need to find an alternative app. Unclear whether the extensive list of advertisers are used for pro users."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Getting error while subscribing and not able to continue."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for easy upload of pdf"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Would give it 5 stars, but I can't share the ""pro"" features via my family library. The pro features are tied to your google account on your device. The better model is a pro version of an app that allows it to be in the family library so my kids can use it too. It's too bad. I prefer this app to all the other scanning apps I've tried."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"In applying syncing to the User's Cloud storage, the App Dev ridiculously conditions it to be able to do everything: to create any file (not only the synced Scanbot data), to view/read, edit, & delete ALL User's data, also to view & edit User's shared data and whoever the data shared with in his Cloud. This is a PRIVACY VIOLATION that cannot be tolerated. The access rights/permission should only be limited to managing data created from this App. Such bad policy ruins any good aspect of this App."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is very difficult to use with the free version. It is terrible. You can't get a good picture/scan. The filters are all reserved for the paid version. Not impressed at all"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Main use is to data mine your documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanning app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent yet with every update it get bwtter"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best ever ..you HV all options including compress option n all for free ..well done .. highly recommend!!! On top of tht very simple to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst app not to use its a waste of time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a great little app for keeping and organizing all the mounds and mounds of paperwork that seem to constantly overwhelm my life and home. The pro version is a 1 time fee and super reasonable (though I have been doing the free version for over a year now and still don't really need it). The clarity is superb and the UI simple and intuitive. Love an app that does what it says and does it well. Great job devs!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"bad stuff"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Says it can encrypt and password protect documents, does not for Android version. Want refund for in app purchases."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this app for all my document organization needs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best quality scans of any app I've used. Simple, easy, works exactly as advertised!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best mobile scanner I've ever used for both apple and android devices... love the ability to upload scanned content directly to a variety of cloud services. Also impressed with the scan and OCR quality.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's bad... Google is even free"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app used to work better. Now it thinks every form I'm scanning is a QR code. Really obnoxious."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can we use already taken signature in JPEG format on scan or uploaded/downloaded pdf file...?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Every time I tried scanning it would ""detect"" a QR code and pull up a screen to different product links, but there wasn't a QR or barcode of any kind on my documents. Tgis app is a waste of time. Spent 10 minutes trying different angles and lighting to get nothing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"As easy as it can get"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good and easy😉"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"BEST APP ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I used to LOVE this app since it really is user-friendly and creates nice scans if you really just need a mobile scanner, but after the update I can't keep my free account. It is basically making it so you have to pay for the services. I get to the new screen to subscribe to an email list and get an error. I've tried several times to uninstall and reinstall and nothing has been working. Edit: Fixed the problem - they are super responsive and friendly!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Thumbs up"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. Scanned 30 pages from my phone. Went to upload to my Google Drive and they are all lost. Waste of time. Finicky app. Spent an hour and a half trying it out after I've learned to use other scanning apps in a matter of minutes. Not sure why this was rated so high, but avoid the hype."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It moves very slow. Almost the features are on pro. This is the 8'th app tried today. On this top - is on the 7'th place. I dont reccomend. PS - the trials are made on a Samsung Note 7."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love It"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Quite useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Why does it need access to ALL Google drive files? I think it should only have access to files it creates."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Asked to upgrade every photo and every time you do anything with app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"All features advertised are awesome compared to others. However, what I do not like is that an image derived from Scanbot cannot be edited by an orginal gallery app. Also, the image is not shown in Line application when I want to send it to other. It would be better if this problem is fixed, or if you have a solution regarding this, please tell me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The scanner works great, the fax works great, this app has increased my productivity."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Would be nice to be able to edit a scan (change filter, cropping, page organization) even some time after clicking ""save"". As of now I could only do annotation. -- thanks for the quick response, up to 5 ⭐ for now and look forward to this feature :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The scan function stoped working. The scan display stays red."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This Scanner is very usefull. I would recomend this app to my Mother and im not lying either. Great Job Scanbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I truly wanna love this app, but it's... Missing feature somehow. Not able to delete page after save, Instead you have to delete the whole document and rescan it. It is so inconvenience! Also, while iOS is having Sanbot 9, we fellow Android user is having 7 instead.... So am sure we are missing out. Decent app but hardly recommend for productivity user."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic scanner app. I tried a lot before deciding which I was going to use, but firmly settled on this which has become my go-to app. I even upgraded to pro and I rarely do that unless an app proves worth it. Keep up the good work Devs (who are still actively developing the app which is always a good sign). 👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow! This app is truly is Amazing!! It is definitely the best of it's kind!! Thank you to the creators!!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Magic color- missing from free version. Only thing anyone really needs & widely available on other apps. Recommend, camscanner, office lens, docscanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Couldn’t scan properly. The screen crashes whenever I tried to scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Compared to other apps like CamScanner or Scannable (the best I have tried), the quality of documents is much worse with ScanBot. The others make it feel like it is a high quality printer scan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far so good I haven't really used it due to my Wi-Fi connection being flow slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This works fine for scanning documents but the fax feature is a complete scam. They charge about $1 per page and so far it has taken 7 hours and my fax has not even gone through. Just keeps saying ""sending"". To make it worse they don't respond to an email question through technical support. Do not fall for buying their fax credits. I had a deadline to meet for court and this may end up costing me nearly $100,000. At the very least it will be a lot of hassle to overturn the judgment."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I am quite annoyed when l use this app,you know what the photos are always not clear and l can't see the words. Sometimes it crops a part of my photo too."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have the pro version Used to be amazing but it no longer transfers files to my Google drive so not nearly as useful I did reach out to customer support but didn't get a response I downloaded Microsoft lens and I'm happy with it so far"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Why is your pricing not transparent? What are you trying to hide? Is £5.49 monthly, yearly or perpetual? One is might be exceptional value, whilst the other is expensive. Close, but no cigar. The blurb suggests I could use values from the receipt to make up the file name. This is not the case. It doesn't even detect the important receipt data. It does support the largest amount of cloud destinations I have seen in a receipt app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best Scanner App I could find. The Pro version is a must!"

Also sucks that the ios version has subscription. And i cant shift my pro plan there. I bought the top of the line vip to support you guys.😕 The app although could use some work in design but the app is fantastic, it deserves 5 stars i wont be giving it now. If they help me i sure will change it. Edit :- they helped me, so changed it to 5 star."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"3 starst because it invades privacy. Could be a great app and i would have paid for it, but with so many privacy issues, i ain't gonna pay a dime. A scanner app does not need more the sorage and camera access. Everything more then this is called spying, tracking, analytics."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"OCR only works in multiple pages mode not working when scan single page"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Being a premium user since the first day of trying this app way back in 2018, i find that there's a definite need to work on the UI. Its really confusing at times to understand which document had synced and the ones which are in the process of syncing. The icons are not in line with Google's typical material design. Rather you can bring in tabs to find out which docs are device only and which have synced to the cloud."

Please find a solution to this problem. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Too much is not for me. Great job Google"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I've been looking for for years. Really refined scanning user experience. Auto open scan, auto scan, name templates, auto upload, filters that can be saved.. well worth the £5 to me. Suggestions: name template to hook in to OCR (via logos?), or even just remember name components you've used before. The suggestions aren't too helpful, but I'll often be picking eg a vendor name (receipts) that I use a lot. And maybe allow saving as png to save space if a lot of black and white"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not as advertised i paid for full version of this app to use the OCR function but it never worked i sent an email to support tree days ago and no answer yet i feel like I've been robbed the main reason I paid is OCR and i doesn't work 😡 also it doesn't save to photos or gallery and when i tried searching for a scanned file name in my files app i found nothing and if you try to save to a cloud i wants a full access to everything in the clout🤦🏻‍♂️ i want my money back ill just use MS lense"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm giving the app 5* based on customer service which is excellent. Although the app isn't at the moment meeting my needs to save documents in individual folders. The team at Scanbot are excellent they kindly refunded me. I would definately buy the app in the future if it has a folder option. Thank you for being so helpful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"So far... So good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far excellent!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. You can scan your document on the go."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Useful!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm going to scan everything because I don't want anything to happen to precious documents from other apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This paid version also disappointed me. Its full of bugs. Get lost selected image, keep processing after a very very long time, stupid OCR reading, cant name single when batch processing, too much disappointed...and ya please don't reply am sorry or sorry to hear it or something like that. Work on this app that will help people...( only replying nicely doesn't help)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The app now wants access to the entirety of my cloud drive to allow auto-uploading to work, even though it had more restricted permissions before (10-Dec-19).While this is now explained, I don't feel like this is a good decision in terms of privacy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. The best out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best docs scaner , this app does what it's supposed to do , thx a lot for this useful app . Big Bravo to the conceptors ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"A really excellent app that scans intelligently and accurately and produces clear PDF documents from the results. it's ability to synchronise with cloud services means your documents are saved in an accessible place. The various filters help clarify problem scans effectively. I would like to be able to add to a PDF that I created outside of Scanbot. The app does hang on the naming field - it would be great if you could disable the lookup and just let me type."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Useful apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"As a first time user I found it relatively easy to work out, and the clarity of the picture is far better than the app I've been using to convert my childrens work to .pdf and upload to school."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great to use and easy to learn"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner I have ever used so far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Best app ever..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app but... Can you please add an option to auto-save scans to phone/SD card. Same idea as auto uploading to cloud only for saving to local device storage."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"My jury is still out. Tried to scan a Walmart receipt in and directed me to the Walmart app. No thanks. Tried folding the QR code out of the frame still would not take the picture. Damn to hell those that geo fence and steal data I say. If I find out this app is sucking data..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Nice app, but only 2 stars for forcing to give so wide permissions to my Google Drive when enabling syncing. From the Android permissions dialog: ""This app wants permission to access everything in your Google Drive. It will be able to do the same things that you can do"". Isn't there more limited permission that would allow this app to upload the scans to its folder? It would work much better for me if Scanbot can just use its single folder - no need for the navigation at cost of sharing all my content with the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Why this app generate a file log in the File Manager?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Need to have folder options. So documents can be organised accordingly. UI can be little more tideous."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Loved free enough to buy it use for business/health/auto insurance, reciepts... Ect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app to get PDF files on to your Pc quick and easy."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great page capture tool. Can create PDF doc using phone camera. Clear instruction included and works great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app pdf all pdf app try but best scanbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Pretty good... Ideally at the end of scanning multiple sheets the choice should be ""separate"" vs ""combined"", NOT the current ""single documents"" vs ""combined"" (which can be perceived as the same thing). I don't know how many times I've been in a rush and clicked 'single documents'. And the upload sync process has seemingly gotten more convoluted in the past few months. (I just killed 30min plus.)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Functional"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"TERRIBLE APP Have to pay to export anything. And when you don't pay, and ""save"" your pic, it doesn't save to your phone or gallery or Google drive, it's just gone, but says it ""saved"" it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app work fine just a little problem that whenever i save my file its just duplicate the file, 1st on my selected path and second its own path."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has been greatly improved and is now just about as perfect as an app can get. I have used a lot of scanning apps, this is the best I've used by far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Dear app developers, why don't you mention that yours filter options is unlock only in premium account in the ""app description"" You are just making fool to download your app. Please clear that in your app description , ""Our filter and other things are only available premium version !"""
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. When trying to scan text it gives you a QR code reading."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far set up and took one scan of cigar box top to check it out, wonderfully fast in a simple scan and cropped it with instant perfection!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It crashes all the time and won't let me access my scanned files, and I even paid for it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I started using Scanbot in response to some of the changes in cam scanner and I've been very pleased with the results. I mostly use Scanbot to photograph whiteboards after meetings at work and the result has been good quality PDFs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Garbage!!!! Hard to use! I even upgraded to pro. Wasted my money.!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"allbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use with auto scan. A winner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective, I scan my docs then share with Boxcryptor to crypt the docs, then delete in Scanbot. The app does a good job a taking the photo of the docs only. I like the option to edit the default naming of the files."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far, it's super simple, accurate and overall, seamless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Top"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Lost scans that I captured at a planning retreat. Other scans were duplicated for some reason. Very frustrating."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very excellent this App that you give to my phone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Lack of features.. it's not properly scanning any docs.. and there is no option to scan and crop a image from local gallery.. i purchased it but didn't like it.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. But how do i restore my bacup files from Dropboks when istalled Scanbot on a new phone?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have been waiting over 20 min for the documents I have scanned to be processed and able to be emailed. I am not satisfied at all with this app. Just wasted $6.00!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love free version!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"FREE VERSION!!! Love it!!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really for scanning and then sending by email - so useful A1xxxxx"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm using this to be sure nothing is lost during this drastic and complicated time in my life. Its so simple to use when doing large quantities of images that it has made my stress levels go way down and I can feel relieved that i will have all my precious and important items stilll with me. Since I'm so paticular about getting them perfectly edged, this is remarkably simple to use. Thank you for your attention to my details."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Tldr: Intuitive, easy to use, out of your way scanning. For me, the best part it is how the app just let's you use, no unnecessary interruptions or anything — I rarely habe time nor patience for micromanaging an app, even more so when scanning a document. And once it's taken, all will automatically appear in your favorite web storage solution, named according to a chosen pattern (I love the location one) and OCR'd if you want to."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Can change storage to sd card. New info 10/2019: I have tried my scanning apps PC & phone...Scanbot is one of the best ocr scanning apps.. worth your hard earned money. Good features."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan app ive tried"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled immediately. All good features behind a paywall. Unethical practice to list them in the description of a ""free"" app. Bait and switch."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Lots of storage options."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"No option to make a folder on the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Im freien Modus ziemlich gut, lange Zeit so benutzt. Jetzt mit der Pro Version ist alles noch einfacher - vor allem das signieren / editieren ist super!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Needs ability to save individual scans taken at the same time in a folder both in the app and when backing up."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thank you for not making this a subscription app like many others! Paid for VIP! Thanks!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is great! It helped me scan documents at home and even upload to wherever i needed the documents to go. Thanks 😺"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app this.. so easy to use, I really love it.. Ty 🙏"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Barely I have installed and for sure is the best app for document scanning!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good so far. Better than CamScanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have just purchased this app. Very annoyingly trying to snap automatically and not scanning the full page. I was unable to turn the automatic function off. I have paid for the pro version without the option trying the app first. Very disappointed"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The App I ever dreamt of having according to my office. A great solution to many office challenges with documents. Keep it up...consider logging in details do the app can be used on any compatible device."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does this app contain deceptive ads?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Assom"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it is a great way to Keep up with reciepts and anything else, such as bills and your grocery list"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Kept on crashing from day one although i bought the full version. I still say this is a scam. Where is google play store not taking action. I want my refund. I have sent many crash reports and still no solution even with the latest update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"it keeps closing evrey time !!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good scanning app, but just pay for it. The free version is probably fine, but it's so important to support the software that you use and the people behind it. I can't stand ads in my face wherever I go, so I'm more happy to pay a small amount of money for a clean experience."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Bug free, fast, great free features!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Auto detection is pathetic."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"My favorite scan application since I've using smartphone. It helps me every single day in my life, staying organized, have all my documents and bills on my cloud. Thanks to developer. Go PRO for support. Have a great day. Peter"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It work well before but it has so many problems. Scanned 30 pages the camera blinked all pages gone. I combined pages, renamed them and delete the original pages. When I uploaded the file to Google drive the app restored the deleted pages and changed the names back again and just uploaded the original files. After these two problems I scanned another 66 pages but the whole file is corrupted. Problem after problem. I scanned over a 150 pages for nothing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanner app! I wanted the best the Play Store has. So I downloaded the top 10 and ended with Scanbot the Pro version has all the features I was looking for and some that I didn't know existed. Scanning PDF files and pulling the text from them saved me a headache. I needed to update my resume and I only had a PDF format copy stored in the in cloud. With no software available. That' just one of the many times this app has proved its worth. Thank you dev's awesome app with great functionality!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great, but it's expensive"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Let me see how much help it will be haven't used it yet"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great product."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was ok when using on iPhone but on Android phone the scan quality is very poor. There is no option to adjust the camera while the device can do 48mp"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I like the idea of scanning things that are needed go be scanned. However, I do not like how the photos become grainy and hadd to make out when the preview of photo you could read everything."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Third class application ..... Worthless please don't waste your time to download it ....."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Hi my"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This apps interface is well thought out. According to the privacy policy your scanned data is not automatically sent from the device without you configuring it to do so."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not actually scan when I try to use the camera"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm another ""refugee"" of camscanner - or cam scammer perhaps I should say, after they were thrown out by Google Play for privacy concerns. It turned out to be doing me a huge favour. After discovering Scanbot, I found it superior to camscanner. The auto cropping works fine and it's ability to automatically upload to the location of your choice is a real time saver. I didn't hesitate to go for the full license."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best Scaner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"You can't see the size of the Document, you can't select the pages to delete once it's converted into .PDF, it's just not a user friendly app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"*Pro User* Good, but missing folders. I need to organize my scans. Apparently other users are also asking for this standard feature."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent app. symple, easy it's use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Never glitches, free app in time of need , all you need."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"What an app.This is one the best Qr scanning app. It gives quick results. But there was a problem its interaction with my mobiles browser was not as perfect as I thought so please improve this feature."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just as I want.👍👍👍👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Crashes every time I try to share or view the photo I have took, and this is very annoying and I am a premium user though, so I please fix your program"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It is good but I am uninstalling it! Because I have an other of 10 mbs and working just like this one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have downloaded but this app unable to open"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Disregard my last review. Great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app is very good but need to improve little bit in scanning. It cant recognise document where some other app can do. After purchasing a paid version it is little bit sad. I also have a question. If i need to change my phone then how my Scanbot pro will come in that phone? Can any one help me with this?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good workflow and image quality. Two major gaps: 1) does not do perspective well, so a scan from an angle isn't the best (and a scan from straight on can be suboptimal because of lighting and shadows). 2) Android version does not allow deletion of a single page from a multi-page document. for a business traveler using this app for receipts, these are significant issues. Unless these are fixed, I will be going back to CamScanner once they get rid of the malware problem."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Worked awesome, and was simple to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Marvellous app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Your answer was helpful and because of you on 14 September 2019 I bought scan bot pro version. Thanks for your help on the issue. Previous :- Hi, Scanbot Pro for Android is subscription based or 1 time payment only. I am under impression it is 1 time only purchase but need confirmation from Scanbot team. I need to know urgently because my playstore credit is expiring in 24 hour's. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It is very slow to identify the page and take the picture. More importantly, this app deletes all progress when you switch over to another app for a moment. This is incredibly frustrating when scanning more than a couple of pages."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Makes my commitment to being paperless possible!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Pro version scanning capture is very poor compared to office lens. I am thinking of Uninstalling even my money is wasted."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Almost everything is a Pro feature (Premium subscription) to be bought before you can use it. I mean editing a scanned doc with just greyscale to even make it more brigther and cleares is also chargeable. In todays day and age if you wanna charge for such a basic feature too then you definitely deserve users walking away from using your apps. Rediculous..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I also switched from Camscanner which I loved. I tried other products and settled on Scanbot as it was closest to Camscanner. It is a suitable switch. The ""refinement"" after the photo of the image is less than CamScanner (which could clean up even a fuzzy image) and it's a little clunky in the app to move the borders and make the image straight. The processing time for the document takes forever. I can't just take a snapshot and email it immediately. It takes 5 min to process before I can email."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I would love the app to be free or close to less than RM 10. I'm still a student. Can't afford to be not frugal about things 😂"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excellent. New to app. Will revise after some use.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"AWESOME APP!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Marginally works. Loads slowly, has trouble edge finding, poor pictures adter processing, and their magic color type feature leaves things grainy. Wish I hadn't paid for it. There are better ones out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"not good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought the program and it keeps closing every time I open the program. The support is not quick and it has been more than 4 days now. I request a refund because the support is poor. As of today is 10th of September no one looked at my issue and no one refunded me. I have emailed so many times and I got one reply and shared my issue but again no one came back to me at all. I need a reply as the support is very poor"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great CamScanner alternative."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really easy. Love the smart cropping AND the easy of adapting the cropping if need be. Easy to scan to Evernote or other services. It would be nice to be able to scan to jpg also."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Unbelievably useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Using a Galaxy S10+ and the quality of the scans the app takes is really bad even when setting the quality to the highest in the settings. The lens is clean but somehow its just blurry. P.S. There are more users complaining about blurry images on S10's as well so it's not just me. Hoping that the developer tries to fix this because it's useless for me in the current state..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing 😍 , you are welcome anytime 🌹"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Share option from gallery is not seeing in OnePlus 5"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I really regret that I bourgt this app. It has problems defining edges, white paper on a dark brown surface! What a nightmare. Camscanner is simply on another league"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Es wäre sehr hilfreich, wenn man Seiten auch nach dem Speichern des Dokuments entfernen oder bearbeiten (Seite drehen, Farben ändern) kann. Edit: in der Vorschau sind die Fotos immer verpixelt/ verschwommen. Dies verschwindet, wenn man die Seite zoomt. Finde es aber besser, wenn die Bilder im Vorschaumodus eine hohe Qualität besitzen, damit man nicht denkt, dass die Hand beim Fotografieren gezittert hat."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exactly what you need out of a scanner app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The scan quality and control looks very good. Problem is that there seems to be absolutely no ability to organize and store the files after taking the pictures. No folders, no labels! This is a huge problem! I purchased the pro version hoping this would be included but apparently it's not! Also it is pretty slow when capturing and processing images; it would take very long to capture a booklet or even a research paper... But this is secondary...As a side note, ocr is practically worthless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I switched to Scanbot Pro after trying a few apps and I would have rated it 5 stars if the following would have been addressed. 1. Users can't remove single/multiple pages from a combination of pages once scanned. 2. No option to lock access to confidential and private documents or to share from gallery. 3. The home page is cluttered & needs improvement. 4. There's no default mode for various kinds of documents like business cards, IDs etc. 5. The online upload feature fails to work at times."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"False advertisement on what it's capable of you cant scan and edit the actual document It just a basic scaning app renames file I just paid for the pro thinking you could scan the files and remove text like it says on there site don't waste your money Google documents does everything this does for free"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really like Scanbot. The Pro version is well worth the price."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Looking for a Camscanner alternative. Disappointed by this. Can't seem to save JPG to my Gallery."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app crashes. Waste of money. Please refund my money asp."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not good. Interface is bad. Too many options and time consuming. Not a quick app. Tests Patience. Picks knky pictures under auto mode. User cannot customize the scan area...dlnt waste time in trying this app.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not much features. It can't do watermark. You also can't re-crop or reapply filter to scanned documents. The annotate doesn't allow you to type. The cropping detection is good though. Implement missing features above and I'll definably purchase this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Good programme but extremely annoying trying to automatically find the frame and didn't find how to disable it. Remove this idiotic feature and I change for 5 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I could have just taken a picture with better quality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent first experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good alternative to cam scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Decent scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very fine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Stupid tool, very difficult to get the right edge. Things get eventually done with physical scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Compression is superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Not alternate for cam scanner.. Still need more features like cam scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"poor experience in first go. Cam scanner is much better. Everything is paid in this app. even for Magic color."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"My only recommended fix for an otherwise almost perfect app is to have it stop returning to the top after returning from viewing a scan, very painful to sequentially view scans. Also it would be great if it was possible to change the size of the thumbnails of the scans in the app, as I only really use it for taking pictures of receipts for warranty etc and because sequentially opening of scans is impossible it's not possible to find anything without meticulously renaming each scan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"cant complain as of now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Crashes after I paid for Lite"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ভাল একটা এপ"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good app overall, but it would be nicer if I could combine multiple scans into collage too, rather than pdf. Since CamScanner is gone, it's too much of a hassle to use two separate apps to make collages. Would buy if devs add this feature. Also preview quality is very bad and at first made me think that this app has crappy scanning quality. Once I zoomed in it became clear that this is not the case, but it's confusing and I think some 1 star reviews are due to this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very helpful , like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good scanner I have ever met"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Can't brighten or cleanup the image in the free version. All documents show up with a grey background instead of white. Uninstalling."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This was a hidden gem, Probably the best Document scanner out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"excellent easy to use. nice features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Waiting for feature parity with the iOS version before I commit my money. Coming from CamScanner, I need an app that provides the option to password protect PDFs and I'm willing to pay for it. Support was very responsive but couldn't give a timeline for the feature. Scanbot for iOS already supports password-protecting PDFs. So, I will have to wait. Scanbot, please add this feature. My money's waiting."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is amazing. I do not need to be home using my printer. Made in America. Proud of you all for developing this app.🇺🇸"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great App! :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good in automatic mode.. And had very good results."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect scanning so far with great edge detection."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excelent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Terrible functionality compared the the FREE Camscanner app. I wish i woulsnt have wasted the $5.49 for the upgraded version. Its just not the best app out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Been pro since long ago. Best scan app. Period. 😎👍🏼"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Unable to disable shutter sound ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app , better than Adobe."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app is not stable and whenever I go to setting page it crash, I have paid for the full version but I'm not happy at all wirh what I experienced so far"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good application but missing very important thing making it useless , it doesn't have folders and all your files will be in huge list."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Tons of good practical features that make your life easier. You won't regret it once you buy it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This was suppose to be the best app .. recent updates are becoming worse and 1 page document is queueing for ages then app is crashed... i think they are not keep their software updated with latest updates from Samsung .. using S10 with latest software update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good. Thank you so much for pdf."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scanbot is an easy to use app that can scan in B&W, greyscale, and color. It can save PDFs as single pages or combined in one file. Users can save their files locally on their phone and/or upload their files to the cloud, e.g., Google Drive. Users may scan documents, photos, and objects. My only complaint is that the app is a little finicky about steadying the phone in order to scan an item. If the coders of Scanbot can make this process a little easier and faster, they will have a 5-star app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just works! Fantastic app with great developers!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's biggest advantage is that OCR text are searchable within the PDF documents. The other scanner apps only recognize text and extract it, but data are not embedded in the PDF document, hence not searchable. OCR is also very accurate."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"How about NO star? Your app sucks because you're too Greedy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very GOOD APPS"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bad bad bad. I used to use this app and thought it was trustworthy. They have in just a few months stolen over 52 dollars from me, prior stole 36 dollars and never sent my fax, my account prove that and then companies I fax too have confirmed in writing scanbot sends nothing (companies I know well and have never had faxing issues until scan bot) yes I pay for this service and yes u advertise that your professional. I will get every penny back no matter what."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love the simplicity of this app. It allows me to save documents to my cloud drives. Awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I thought that it was free! Silly me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It is a good app, no doubt. If One feature is added in the app that is we can import images and convert to pdf, app will become a perfect all in one app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Some of the functions would have been nice to use. The only problem is that the ap p couldn't properly scan a document. It kept cutting it in half or cropping it automatically in weird ways and there was no way to tell it not to."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It tell my answer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"thanks developer☺️"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"if I don't purchase it and get the free version of it,the image quality is not even zero , it is bad than the original image. it is not free.i have uninstalled it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"perhaps the app should be renamed ""scambot"". I purchased the premium version that allows installation on two phones. There is ZERO info on how to perform the second phone install. An email to scanbot has gone unanswered."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great works perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not subscribe"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"satisfied"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"best!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Was working perfectly fine after I bought pro. Then suddenly crashes everytime I try to connect to Evernote, my main note source, so this makes me think that I wasted my money on what could've been a great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Very limited features for free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I will come back and give you the review of a newb once i have honestly learned what this app is capable of helping me with."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I had some issue with 'Upload to Evernote', the app chashed. But still, i bought the app. Great work devs, really useful app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app. One issue, when I press share doc over email, it keeps on asking me by which app although I selected ""ALWAYS"" with Gmail. ONE SUGGESTION: make ""long-press-shortcut"" on scanbot app to directly scan a doc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"too much detail for me"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"useless annoying app, waste of money"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This has to be the best scanning app out there with very good automatic integration with all online storage services! There were issues, and it took them what felt like months to fix it, but they finally did so I am happy now 😊"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"scan is doing good all their works it 100%"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Latest update broke it....document in filter screen now far too small but more importsntly evernote upload has stopped working. educed to one star as it now crashes all the time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless. the free version is crippled. it is devoid of intuitive qualities. Several times in the past I was considered a super user, particularly in a federal agency Information Technology Center. And yet I could not proceed through the process of a single UPC. I will uninstall this immediately. Unless you want results at all, get the pro. I will get a free, better App instead. You have been warned!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"a waste of money... terrible pictures and therefore useless scans"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"there seems to be no way to select existing images from your gallery and make a combined multi page pdf from them."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it was okay"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use and fast"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"just downloaded. doesn't do anything. neither it combines the scanned documents nor merges the document. can't select two documents to email or share at once. the app neither straightend the page ( which the other free apps do) nor gets rid of the shadows. Absolutely waste of money."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"why is not possible to choose specific size? A2, etc"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"perfect tool to go paperless"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use, good result, quick capture"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"just started using but it seems to be flawless! -samsung galaxy s7"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Please remove the subscribing to news letter on new download p.s. add some shortcuts for home screen"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome App!!!😁☝"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have used it for about a week now and it has been great. I will make sure to keep this review updated for more imformatio. At this moment it is the best scanning tool I have used so far bc of the speed it can convert images to pdfs and quickly allow u to go digital."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"does what it's supposed to be doing very well and low key. great tool to have!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far, so good. Now if I can Locate the scans in cloud."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"please fix it. somehow the latest version come with Bugs. Cannot Scan anymore and reinstall it agaim cannot pass through subscribe page"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it works as it should"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"An easy-to-use app with some great features whether on the go or in the office."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"you remember that first time you watched something in HD? switching from office lens to this is like that"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great and easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best. scan bot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I paid for the pro version through the apple store will this carry over to my android account?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This app works very well for scanning documents and syncing them with cloud services. There are many cloud services to choose from. Unfortunately, it does not allow documents to be organized in folders. (It seems the corresponding iPhone app has had this feature for a very long time.) Organizing scanned documents at least in a rudimentary way is an essential feature that's missing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"pretty awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"testing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"very bad app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"performing ocr seems to taken longer time and sometimes it took half day from qued to recognizing text"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"crashes everytime im saving the scan on my device, s10+"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"really really nice.... needs more variables for the naming convention"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"its very good i love this app its free and with it you can scan all your documents easily and very faster.cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Used the app for years for expenses reporting. Install it on every new phone as soon as I can."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far, so good. I'll know after using it for a few weeks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works great.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Keeps giving me QR codes when I just want to scan a document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"⚕️"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"doesn't work. trash app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"perfect application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT! I was using CamScanner. What a rip off. After I bought a license. They then discontinued one-time purchase of licenses and said you now have to pay annually of $50.00 This app is way better. Easier to use. More features. Even has NextCloud built into it. And, it's $8.50 for all features. One time fee. Just like the app I have on my iPhone. Great job. I'll NEVER use CamScanner again!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"terrible"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Used to work great. Nice Features. No longer works on my Oneplus 7. Looks like the app can't focus the camera, all the text remains blurry, even after touching a part of the image."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"nice one scanbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great program. easy to scan, simple to send"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"needed folders or tags"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"stupid app kept trying to search the internet for a barcode that I didnt scan. and when I finally got it to work and saved the documents to pdf the only way to view the documents is to download this app. I'm sure the people I am sending my documents to dont wanna download this app just to get my documents. it's a pdf it should be viewable by any pdf reader."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"none"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Constantly scans only a portion of a document or thinks there's a QR code. Clunky UI."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"does exactly what i was looking for - can combine scans with my chromebook camera"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Never focused on page can't even take a manual shot. And yes I used a clean background and good lighting."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Brilliant. Very simple to use, very fast. Recommended ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy app and useful for business. Don't need a scanner anymore!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far, so good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Somehow, I'm ending up Already having to Review/ Rate this app. Note: I LITERALLY Just installed it just Several minutes ago and so therefore have not Even had a chance to Even Open it; must less Actually USE It - at All yet. For this reason I cannot Properly rate it. So , I just simply took heed to the Information About &/ on the app and, because I have yet to even be able use it , I am giving it 4 stars because it really sounds like a Great and very useful app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It takes a little getting used to but onced mastered it's a very useful accessory. Congratulations!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"More themes, please"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ok good tq"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"One of the best app I have ever found. A must."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"i can't take a decent photo with it if I tried, and I *tried*."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good apps. Simplify me"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a very nice app, I am easily able to scan for work, sometimes the quality isn't the best but overall I would recommend this app to others."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This is nice app. Just getting used, but learning. More later."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"text ocr is terrible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gets the job done. just needs a easyer way to share stuff"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I bought the pro version or this app on Android because I previously had good experience with iOS pro version. However the app just does not work well on my OnePlus 7 Pro.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best Scan Apo Online"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"super-convenient - creates hi-res scans instantly on your phone, and lets you send or share them directly from the app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Thanks. The changes you suggested did work, but I see one needs to pay extra for the OCR functionality so it's not for me. All the best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A completely off-line resident scanner with no subscription fees and privacy. Install the free app and use in-app purchases for lite - ocr, search, and annotate; pro - ocr, search, annotate, automatic perspective correction, filters, qr/bar codes; or vip - update the free version to pro with a second pro license useable with ios or android devices. Excellent support."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I use it for years, love it, but unfortunately is has been buggy for years. OCR takes an eternity and never finds anything. Exporting to PDF generates a corrupt file. Can't export while OCR and can't stop OCR because it isn't reliable.. Love it, but so many issues. I can't trust."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"critical"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"this app is incredible! highly recommended"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does what it claims, has an easy user interface and is simple yet, effective for scanning and backing up important documents. Very well made app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Quality of scans not suitable for the task at hand. No option for a refund."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Exactly perfect for professional scanners like us... It has everything... Bravo to developers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I want to say this. Wouldnt it be natural and logical to allow me to recognize at least 1 page before I pay you?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"One of the Best Scan Apps Ive used. I use it daily as a Truck Driver for Work and quick payment. The only downside is Im unable to send to my instant messenger on my phone only to email."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Be better if free."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"just what I needed"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"super impressive. Trying to minimalize my space by getting rid of paper items. Unfortunately some of those items contain important info. I'm very excited to begin using this to store my docs electronically. Thank you!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Use CamScanner. Paid for the VIP version of ScanBot right off the bat and that was such a mistake. The app doesn't know how to recognize your file. It will very often only grab the middle of your page and leave you with clunky tools to try and edit the pdf to look somewhat acceptable. Even if you somehow manage to manipulate its autofind and take as close to a perfect picture as possible, the pdf will come out with huge differences in focus across the page."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.. Like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"love you Scanbot!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Blech. Constant errors, and one page at a time? Really? In 2019? A waste of $5+"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if I could save scans (based on a tag) to a specific cloud folder within my onedrive cloud file service... basically allowing auto-filing. Other than that, this scanner is fantastic!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"handy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"good stuff"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"low quality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"not user-friendly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I am using this app and is good but recently on S10 and with latest updates it starts crashing and exit without any messages ... 12/6 .. oh the new update is still have same issue even worse ... guess time to uninstall this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"love how easy it is to scan pictures and documents!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The scan app I needed so much."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"should have had this all along"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good job 👍👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A nice and helpful tool !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"App is good, only thing i request to add the feature of Folder and sub folder creation to organise the scanned copies in a better way."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy, and good for business"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The app is fast, easy to use and extremely flexible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Messed up all my settings. Uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"it won't save my PDF I cant send them can accesses them in the app so really frustrating"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome,helped me when im in a pinch"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very good, it's fast and easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it - so easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"cam scanner is best....This software increases the file size....wrost.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful application."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"After using more then a year, I give it 5 stars. It works well on both iOS 11 and Android 8/9 Thing(s) that need to improvement is: - The time it takes after a photo is being made. Is somehow a tad slower on Android than on iOS. Devices used: iPhone 7 Plus and One Plus 6."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"i have 2 Google drive accounts, it won't let me select the 2nd one, keeps automatically grabbing the 1st"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Edited: Did not get to try. Within first few screens it tries to sell you the program. Then it wants you to give your email as a subscription link. can not use without subscribing. Added: Telling me they dont have to subscribe is either a lie or you have a bug. Program closes when I try to bypass subscribing. Forced subscription is usually associated with email list that get sold to spammers. Whether they sell it or not I can not say."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Does what it's supposed to. Efficiently. Easily. And without constant pressure to upgrade. And you know what? I will upgrade! Not because you pressured me (like all the other scan apps out there) but because you offer a superb product at a reasonable price. Thank you."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the best document scanning app I have ever used. It meets my requirements and more. Highly recommend buying the pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A little difficult to use in the beginning but the included manual is very useful. Great job gang 😊"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easily the best scanner out there. Amazing free options, and comprehensive, powerful options in the premium version. I could not recommend this enough, shout out to the developers for making something so good, free!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app is awesome, it really suits almost all of my shool needs, however there's one issue, it won't let me zoom in while using the camera so I can get a better shot of the whiteboard, that's kinda disappointing because the rest of the app is perfect, hope they could add that feature"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Neat! App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"nice, fast and does the job well. Excepting auto color, etc is not as per expected. And if I want to lighten the pic I have taken, need to purchase it. Also need to have an option to store pics as well as pdf."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very nice and easy to use but I can't find my documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good v.good great excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it has improved a lot drom previous time I installed it. I really like it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Worst app🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The most useful free version of a document to pdf scanner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"App looks clean. I come from camscanner and missed the own/nextcloud support there. camscanner also has textual annotations. My understanding is that this is a rather new feature in scambot. Maybe I missed something: one cannot search on the annotations. That makes this feature useless to my opinion. Hope this will be added soon"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use it well. Super!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Doesn't focus the camera on OnePlus 7 Pro. Please fix it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"multiple apps in a app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Going to have to find something else! Tried to scan a 1/4 page mag article with a pic of a screen in it - kept jumping to a red screen about QR code =there wasn't one anywhere on the page! After more attempts kept zooming down to a narrow vertical strip the width of the screen pic. Gave up and used the camera =got it right 1st time with no bother."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This does everything I need for cellphone scanning. Great work. Edit: just purchased pro for access to all of the great features. If you are looking for a scanner app, stop here! Your search is over!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After first scan, which I cancelled since wasn't ready, All I get is a white screen with a scan something and plus button. Hit that and all I get is an import and cancel option. I'll upgrade stars if I can figure this out."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it is simply wonderful..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"not too gud improve it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"friendly app .. Good Job"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Time wasted.. F... off"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I wish the magic filter was available for free users. Also doing any kind of adjustment to Black and White requires payment to unlock. Kinda lame.. I want grayscale scanning, not just plain fax-like B&W"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far so okay. Just got this will let you know when I do"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I cant even log into the application, Ive tried deleting it and installing it twice already and the solution is not resolved. This is making me frustrated and this is why I believe this app deserves a 1 star."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good quality scanner. Easy to use. Just one problem you can not modify ( amend, recrop, magic color) the file afterwards, as available in CamScanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"REALLY great software. Very convenient"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Purchased pro version quite some time_back, unable to get_OCR and other supportive languages. Support_do not care..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"for the price paid one would expect this to work great, but sadly this app is very disappointing. Seems to amplify glare and the document overall looks blurred. Very low quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"scanbot ai perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"outstanding. does ocr. emails. autocrops. the best."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and works well for my needs."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Installed on Huawei Mate 7, Android 5.1.1. Application crashes just after logo display."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"this app is so much better on ios- came over from iphone and paid for the full product straight away as i was expecting the same great app. i have not found this to be the case sadly, scans never come out as well even with a better camera now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Mostly Very Useful for me to get the order in the mail today from my account to see if you could help me...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best App I've Seen In A Long time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Switched from CamScanner ""Pro"". No regret"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This is certainly one of the great scanning app with OCR. However due to lack of functionality of creating folders and organizing scans, using this app has become headache, and started using CamScanner. It seems IOS version has folder creation capability so why not on android version? I would like to give this app 5 start if folder creation capability is added to android version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"not great. buy an ios device use scanner pro. thats what this app should aim to be like."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very useful, for being free it surprises me how well it works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great product"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The free features are very good. Only the Text Recognition (OCR) for that I paid 6€ is poor. Hopefully it's getting better in the future."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is an great App! I am not very technically experienced at all and Scanbot was easy to download and very user friendly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"still trying to figure it out"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"CamScanner was good, but Scanbot is awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"two thumbs up"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"this app does the trick for me so i give it 5 stars"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good and working well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best of its class !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best application with full solutions."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"frustrating app. the square that frames the target document etc keeps moving and never once framed and scanned what i needed it to. always scanned a part of it but not all of it. A news paper article. rediculous app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Totally worth the purchase: going to save me a lot of effort."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"awesome App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"the only issue im having is, it needs more of an editing section."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice. Works!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Works."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"abracadabra! it's just that easy!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"fantastic amazing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app, i use it everyday thankyou!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ive downloaded around 10 different apps primarily for receipt scanning and this is the best so far, even when compared against Adobe and Microsoft apps. Auto upload to cloud, templates for name formatting of receipts, adjustable resolutions of PDFs, crops to the actual scan rather then defaulting to a 8x11 page for exaple - all lot of good work here. The ONLY thing this app lacks is the ability to create folders. That would be my suggestion to the developers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Seemed to be a great app until my client could not open your ""pdf"". I thought a pdf was a pdf for everyone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Helped me just When I need it .Great Job.couldn't be more satisfied !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy and quick to capture documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Tried free version to see if it was useful. It scanned well but saved to some obscure location I could not find, or change in free version. Concluded that all useful functionality is in paid version. Found a free app that met my needs. Uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"paid full thinking that the ocr can read the text but after multiple tries..ocr cannot completely recongise text. always translate with funny characters even with clear document what was converted from receipt pic. those that want ocr u get much accurate results from using Evernote to convert ur pic as doc and using Google lens to translate. direct Google lens translate also does it but not as accurate n sometimes misaligns"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Fails to find the edges of a peice of paper 9 times out of 10. Plus, paid for the medium version and it's still adware."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient. Just the way I like it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"total bs"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app, fast and easy to use. It would be nice if you added folders because it's better to organize different documents. 18/03/2019 After some time the app's takes a lot of time to upload and the thing is that there is no bar to see the speed or how much of the file is uploaded. Also many documents are in queued status still."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"the king"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app for documentation. I would rate 5 but documents took too much time to reopen. Pls help"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy, app works well. Reasonably priced. Dara stored on your own phone, not in cloud."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"decent scanner app. The best feature is the ability to automatically upload to Evernote, but Evernote has a scanner that has more features. The scanner is limited and it is difficult to tag docs. I paid for the full version for the ""smart name"" feature, but this is just a custom naming option, and it doesn't automatically name your docs based off their features as it sounds. Not worth the $$. CamScanner has more intuitive scanner, and so does Evernote"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Family 4life"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great because it is automatic."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Waste of money waste of time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app use it for work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply done better. No ads. No Watermark. Scanbot is what you need!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"answered some of my questions for sure!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly. I like the auto crop feature. Just scan and let Scanbot do the rest."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Love everything except lake of folder support for android. This basically just collects a huge stack of files with no organization. hope to get a refund."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Current version consistently leaves flash LED on after closing app, when flash is used to scan document. Only way to turn flash off is to turn it off manually. Update 3/11/19: Flash issue fixed. scanning multiple page documents is now even easier, faster, and flows really smoothly. star rating increased to 5/5. My flatbed scanner can finally be retired."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"perfect app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excelente aplicación . Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"terrible quality. I uninstalled almost immedaitely afterwards."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great! Scans anything nicely, easy to use. Automatic scanning is a time saver. Just set your phone on a platform with the app open and you won't need to touch it till you're done. Flip the page every few seconds and it'll do it's thing without having to press any buttons. Perfect for archiving!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought this program to transfer Arabic image to text, but it is not working, and their support team is very bad. they tust want to get your money and will not respond to you. لا تشتري هذا البرنامج فهو سيء ولا يدعم تحويل الصورة العربية الى نص عربي كما يدعون، وخدمتهم سيئه."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Got sick of the ads and expected features to work by paying for the app. instead the camera did not cut out the glare from the images nor does it automatically crop the page text. the lack of quality in recognizing text, words, paragraphs and punctuation leaves much room for improvement. Save your time and money by fully testing this app and comparing it to other Apps."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Doesn't seem to do anything. scanned a document and it just sits there doing nothing. Even when tapping on ""recognize text"" still does nothing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I used officelens for a while, but this produces better image quality, with better OCR, and the flow is more straightforward (fewer buttons to press just to get a multipage scan). The direct upload to webdav is also excellent."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"constantly fails to sync to google drive"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple, intuitive, smart. Things I love: autocapture scanning, easy editing options, smart naming suggestions, privacy focused. It's really a perfect scanning app. Honestly I don't have the need to scan all that often but I think I'll buy the pro version just to support the dev."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"wonderful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good handy tool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works well. sometimes, you need to use the corners to fine tune when you're cropping as the edges snap to the wrong places. this happens when the scanned image has a darker border than the interior. anyway, i like the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good for a first timer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Folgendes fehlt mir an der Free-Version: - Es gibt keine Möglichkeit das OCR-Feature zu testen. - Das Erstellen von mehrseitigen Dokumenten ist nicht leicht."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I recently got this app. I paid for the VIP version and couldn't be happier. is very straightforward. I've been able to work on the road and apply for jobs that require me to submit paperwork fast. This app came in very handy and definitely delivered with no issues. I don't have to email to myself or anything like that. You can save on your cloud storage as pdf or jpg. You can also download to your phone too. Definitely recommend this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very convienent and dependable. I had no idea you could fax from your phone! What a great app!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The very best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When I scan, it doesnt convert it to look like an actual scanned document. Only has a snapshot of the document that looks like a normal photo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works like magic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"wonderfull"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"me happy khani"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"A good app but confusing to figure out how to work if you have never done this before. Im still learning but so far pretty good, no complaints"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"What an App!!! the free version itself has so many excellent features. plan to go Pro in the future"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"editorial sudamericana"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"i hate to leave bad reviews but this app just doesnt ""scan"" properly anymore. has no idea where the edges of the paper are. it used to work a year ago or so perfectly... now its a mess"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. I no longer have to carry paper around in my wallet."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Good until now. Won't install the update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"stopped auto uploading and wont upload any more docs. this is after going through the troubleshooting steps provided. complete waste"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"GARBAGE 👎"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"my go-to scan app... thank you for the support and development. my must have application."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"One Question. Is it another free for Scanbot Pro for VIP plan can be used for ios if i buy thru PlayStore?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great scanner app. fast and easy. 2steps only. install, scan. very satisfied."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's getting bigger in size with each new update... Reduce the size or else, make a lite version"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Job gets done quickly. Thank you"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I got the App because it would do OCR and it was free. After downloading, I find out there is a paid version and I have to buy it to do what I'm told the App will do. BAIT AND SWITCH. This is not a free App if you expect it to do what it promises. I will NOT deal with liers. EDIT: So now the programer says he ""clearly states 'the app has in app purchases' "". We're supposed to read his mind and understand 'in app purchases' REALLY means 'this app won't do anything until you buy it.' bogus sad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Controls are touchy & hard to use. Picture quality is poor being dark & out of focus. Most shots are not even usable & a waste of time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I'm giving 4stars, even though I requested a refund. The app needs work, some useful settings are missing. The scanning is excellent, but OCR in my experience is way off. To make this a 5 star app, I would suggest letting the user try out all feature for a few days, before making the in app purchase, or better yet, have a paid version. I very seldom use apps that make you pay in app before having access to added feature. my 4 Stars are for their customer service, which is top notch."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"so useful for consolidation. $400 for a quick physical scanner or less than $10 for this app?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great service and easy to use!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very useful. thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"the best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scan quality is poor"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Updated finally and rating has been changed. It is the best scanning app I've used, but it shouldn't take that long to update a huge issue that makes it actually unusable. ---- Onedrive hasn't worked with it for several weeks now w multiple support tickets submitted. ""Will be fixed soon"". Dont buy of you need Onedrive. Will change the rating when it's fixed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"used to be my fav app for quick scan but now none of scanned files is sharp. tried another app and is fine so I uninstalled it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very Nice App Very Yous Full App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great utility. Well worth it to keep track of receipts and docements."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works very well. Easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great very easy to use . scanned easy quick. awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"terrible experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome! best free scanner so far"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Kinda nice, but.... Well, yup you got pretty nice features but one thing that is bugging me alot is that you can't apply the desired filter to all pages of the document at once rather page by page which is time. Consuming in. Addition to making the app crash from. Time to time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super useful and takes very clean scans! I got the Pro version immediately after my first scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"God"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Horrible. So blurry, you're better off just talking a picture of your document. Very disappointing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"cool App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Recently stopped working with OneDrive. Support confirmed its a known issue.. Please fix ASAP! Rating updated to 5*. Support fixed the issue very quickly.. Now working perfectly with OneDrive. I Iove this app. Especially the OCR which allows searching on text within the created PDF."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does everything I wanted plus some stuff that never even occurred to me, like that it scans barcodes and qr codes and extracts actionable information from the scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent scanner app with auto-upload to a variety of cloud services (Paid Version). You can still upload on the free version, it is just not automatic. This app has everything you need for mobile scanning and then some. Best one out of at least 5 that I tried. Recommended!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"love for it simplicity and it doesn't have watermark"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really nice app, works as described, a real life saver, especially when you have to scan a ton of documents everyday as a student. Only one thing that doesn't work is the coupon which a friend of mine gave to me for the pro version, that would make it superb, it says gift not available."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Life saver. Ultra user friendly. Feature rich. Sent 4 faxes @ 32 pages ea. None arv'd yet machine said it did and total fax cost $128. I found this app, scanned easily and cost 0.99 cents to send all pages, not $1 per page like at Store or Library. Then stored to Cloud account. Crystal clear scan and printout. I will save about $300 a year using this app instead of going to the UPS store or library and being charged $1 per page for a fax."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast, clear and watermark free document scanner great for both single and multi-paged documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"love it! I use it everyday at work... 100% recommended!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Forces to buy paid features, free version is good for nothing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use, very clear"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent service"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Seems good, excellent, in fact, but i domt seem to be able to add a secondary Google account i have on my phone in order to upload files to its Drive.... Am I missing something?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"developer promptly addressed my concerns about a wrongful result by my phone's antivirus that this app was a trojan and put my mind at ease. app does exactly what it's advertised to do."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"My Lookout Security app just alerted me that Scanbot has malicious Trojans in the app that sends banking app username and password to third parties. I just uninstalled the app. I had purchased the full version. Prior to this, I was happy with the app. I took a screenshot of the alert but unable to post it here. Dev needs to answer this alert!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"app has malware according to lookout"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner app I've had so far and it does a lot especially for a free app. Thank you to the developer who reached out very quickly after my previous review and helped me. I highly recommend."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great mobile doc add-on app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The filters in the app are really bad. Most documents scanned using scanbot will look really bad."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app that I now use on a daily basis to store all sort of documents directly to the clouds. The options available and scan quality are impressive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"the iPhone Version of Scanbot is really great but the android version leaves much room for improvement. The app accidently takes pictures when i was just changing papers, cloud upload is buggy, i cannot select the google account since the button is not responding. Thumbnails are blurry. Evernote Upload is not working, it is failing authorization - only sometimes. Change of rendering method cant be done all at once... currently gives me quite some frustration using it, that was much better on iOS"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. I paid the pro version and still not reliable. Dissapointed as it seemed a solid app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"works when it wants to.. doesn't upload to my drive and giving issue when trying to email my documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very easy and intuitive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"better than camscanner! and its a great move no having watermark like the latter. I could use about 5 license for android/apple devices. how do i go about it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Use to Adobe Acrobat Reader"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"super easy to use and functions perfectly!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"first."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool, dependable with plenty of share options, love it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"booommm!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its awesome and very helpful for me"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Limited page zoom level makes this app lousy for viewing your scans, need to open with external pdf viewer instead."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"doesnt work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"27DEC18 I've owned this App (well the basic paid level) for sometime but don't use it very often.  I used it for the first time in awhile this morning on a receipt and it detected the borders quickly and captured the image. I have it connected to Google Drive and it creates its own folder, which many Apps do not (requesting access to for your entire Drive).  Scans can be saved as searchable PDF or JPG although searchable PDF's requires the basic level which is cheap enough and contributes to the Developers efforts. Upgraded back to 5 star again."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very nice. easily focus's on document and captures."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a real pain-saver for documentation tasks. Creates good scans and also has a lot of options for sharing and storing (locally and in the cloud). The OCR seems have improved, it's now quite fast, and I have no crashes like earlier. It embeds the recognised text into the generated PDF's, making them searchable.  It could still improve:   - Enhance the filters with an ""anti-vignettte"" functionality  - Make the preview of the ""autocapture"" rectangle a litte more precise (this sometimes shows a rectangle way off the paper, but the scan then is only the paper)  - Make OCR more precise. Some words, especially with german umlauts do not get properly recognised. I use an english language setting, thus it may not expect these characters. -  Use some ""fast and loose"" OCR to auto detect titles only any use these for naming the PDF's. This alone would be worth the bucks for OCR."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Reliable app Recommend"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"awesome!!! very user friendly!!! thanks!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app fo sho"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"the permissions are getting crazy just to scan items. create an add-on for that excess junk. you do not need to access to my Google service configuration, play install refer, find contacts, location, etc... permissions. whatevs I'll just use another simple and efficient scanning app. it doesn't matter what justification you provide, your app does not need to access this information to function."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"iOS version is fabulous... Don't know that had happens when comes to Android ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"gud one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No better than using camera phone and certainly not worth the high cost demanded for pro version"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Extremely easy to use and less cumbersome than OfficeLens or CamScanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Processing is very VERY slow. Every time I take photo, it takes like 10 seconds to initially process it. Then after every change couple of seconds. And then from couple of minute to forever takes also final processing, before I am able to open and share the doc. I am using premium version with Google Drive synchronization on OnePlus One."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thankyou"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Just got it and will try it on my old photo's"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Overall pretty nifty, with some bugs. Worth the few bucks if you have a good camera vs buying a scanner for home use (receipts.) Issue on Pixel XL and latest Android 9: it refuses to automatically upload scans to Google Drive. I have to disable and re-enable the setting and check upload previous scans to save them to my Drive. OCR is pretty much worthless so don't buy it for that."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's good and very powerful scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really great app. Got pro for real cheap on black friday and the OCR is very impressive. Would recommend to everyone, but especially students."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Qr pop up is annoying. Should allow option to turn ogff"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This app used to work really well until I upgraded to a Huawei Mate 20 Pro and now it just stalls after capturing any image and won't go any further."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanned copy not saved in galary"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So easy, beautiful scans, great integrations with other apps"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work properly... Always makes a picture by itself- always to early..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"AMAZING! Finally an app that ""really"" does do higher resolution scans! (Camscanner unfortunately decreases resolution even from imported files) The auto shoot and crop is WONDERFUL. Only sorting and saving is a bit to get used to (I don't find it intuitive enough). I miss an option to make an album (or chosse batch), and then scan into the album, autoname files by the album and then upload the full album online (instead of having to choose indiviual files manually from the main list). The overview with all scans being thrown into one main list isn't functionally satisfying. Also too much back and forth to rename scans that belong to a named group - you have to remember to reset to a new default name each time, manually mark files and then upload. This is all handier with Camscanner (batch mode which saves all scans into a indivitual sets and let's you ""select all"" ) or Photomyne (albums). It would be nice to have a choice to do batch and then be asked what the default name of the files should be. But maybe this is already possible Scanbot and I missed it? Otherwise 10 stars! - November 3 update: I jist found out that group naming is a snap! Just choose multipage scanning. You will see the default naming scheme on the top of the screen. If you edit that filename it will be used as the default on saving and any additional scans in that set will be named in incremental steps with (1), (2), (3) etc. :D - Ich habe nicht mal gemerkt das ihr eine Deutsche Firma seid. Top Produkt, danke :D"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The scan quality is not all that great. It wants to leave out parts of the document. And if stores scans in one of the most obscure places imaginable. I expected more from the pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great product"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exelant"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a real time saver if you have many documents to scan and save as PDFs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app, but you should add an option to set the page size of the scanned document (Letter, A4, Legal, etc.); this is an important feature when scanning documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fentastic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is saving me a lot of time. Well worth the pro version I am using. I do my scans automatically uploaded to Google Drive. All types and sizes of documents. Single or multiple pages. At home office or on the go. One of those apps you just have to have!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very accommodating very accommodating"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ocr is not working in bengali language.scan quality is low.I became angry when I saw your paid version app.Canscanner is better than this app.So my request you to please refund my money as soon as possible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I really think it worked talking to letters lol"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Pretty easy to use. Pretty accurate with capturing documents. Adding pages feature is nice. Option to save as single or individual docs is a plus. Clear images as if on a printer type scanner but that may depend on your phn. Samsung Galaxy S9."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really has changed my documentation process... Just love it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Constant bar code pop ups and bad collective combination features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"App claims to be free but in a free version I was unable to create a PDF document because I was prompt to buy extra services to be able to use even simplest black and white filter. In short words the app is not free as it claims a free version can achieve nothing really"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"GREAT"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Keep Up Up with your paperwork anywhere"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I installed this app because I saw on quickbooks website it's an option for cropping documents on their app. Unfortunately it doesn't show as a ""camera source"" inside their app... any suggestions?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best in the best."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan to PDF on Android, and I have tried them all. I also love the auto-sync to Dropbox (I think I paid for that but it was worth it)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scanning function is perfect. Faxing rates are exorbitant. Alternative services like faxfile do the same thing for literally half the price."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderfully made app... I would have given a more star if there was. I really love it...😍😍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"True"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excelente, beautiful, clean and inexpensive to access full features."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thank you all working now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I have aa problem if i want to save a pdf the app just goes back to the camera and nothing happens"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking photos of documents, and cropping/sorting out perspective issues. I must admit, I don't use the advanced functionality, but if it's half as good as the perspective and cropping stuff, then it will be brilliant."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app .. Thanks for the creators"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wonderful, very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Without trial period to test pro version. Why to pay something untested ??? I MEAN THAT BASIC FUNCTIONS TEST IS NOT ENOUGH, GIVE TRIAL DAYS FOR THE PRO, AS MANY OTHER DEVELOPERS DO..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Gooooooood"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for uploading document's!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Use this all the time. Highly recommend this app for business owners."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scanbot Pro: The auto detect feature stays active even after the automatic option is disabled. To get a useable image you'd have to retake the photo around 2-3 times. The OCR function is very poor as well. Bought the pro option by mistake and I don't think I'd use the free version because of several issues with the app, very poor function."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very poor apps,not even for test, just ask for perches pro version!!b"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app good In everyway"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love it and it came in really handy for school"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The free version of this app did nothing. Might be good if you could scan and have it in your pictures or be able to email a document but nothing. I wouldn't waste my money since this did nothing for me. Don't bother responding back telling me to email you cause I won't"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Luar biasa"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"easy to use. NOT bad so far. Thanx"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I like the basic Scanbot so much that I purchased the Pro version.  Unfortunately the Pro Pack never loaded on my phone and none of the pro features work which make me question the integrity of the app / developer.  I would like to think this is just a technical issue and they will provide the pro pack but not getting my hopes up"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a long time, it is a very quick way to copy, name and store to a cloud. Then papers can be binned, perfect."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's convenient"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I think its to better for all user"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app..keep it up...automatic app..and intelligent as well"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's the best one that I could find on Android systems but I wish if it allow you to create folder within the app as the scanpro on iPhone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to make pdf documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It works good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I liked it when it worked. I just changed my cellphone and the app is giving me an error account and I'm not able to use the app I paid. Very disappointed. Any solution on this?!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Is the best app with low internal RAM data requirement with both QR/Barcode and Document Scanner. Looks gigantic!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's the best app to to fixed everything"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"First, thank you Scanbot team for the amazing app! It is a great package of multi features that do actually make my work easier. Scanning is as good as a conventional scanner, sharing the scaned files is so easy and swift, naming the files is typical and helpful. You also get to choose to send your scans as pictures or just group them together and send them as a pdf file! That's amazing. Also you have basic photo editing features if you do need them. QR reader is great but make sure to turn it off if you mean to actually scan the barcode (I believe a prompt message would be helpful here) .. my cons are only the following: 1- I was hoping the Fax feature would have been Global and cheaper. 2- The OCR is one of the products/features I still struggle finding one that actually works at least 90% (OCR Require a clean scan with clear fonts not some designing and graphical ones -> this is for the users to take into their considerations before judging any OCR feature) Thank you Scanbot team!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I don't know if it's any good yet just downloaded it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"They are there for making money all basic features needs purchase,....my first negative review on play store....."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"If you are considering buying this app for the OCR feature, DON'T! I always have to do the scan at least twice, if not more, because it doesnt work right. This app is a huge time waster and is terrible. Save your money."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"💘 this pdf scanner. Much better than Adobe's scanner app, and Scanbot is free no matter what."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app has a mind of its own and is very obnoxious."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best scan app. Pro version had everything I need like WebDAV sync. It works perfectly with my Synology NAS. Great work. Thank you"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"👌"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super office tool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best of its kind. Easy to use. Great by all standards."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent for facilitators capturing flip charts and documenting meeting notes!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The iOS app is great. What happened in this one? It's terrible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It is not capturing the edges clearly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"""scans"" when im not ready and doesnt even get edges of document right. Worthless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very effective for document scan to pdf."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing and efficient to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"برنامج رائع"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Wasnt what I was looking for ..but the scanbot team is very professional and quick to resolve the issue I had."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Worked great the first time! Easy to use. thanks!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for over a year now without issue."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app. Great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for a few years now and have not ever had an issue sending any documents. Documents are able to be saved and the free service is GREAT. I'm going to upgrade to the next level. I advised a few people about Scanbot."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Slowest scanning app EVER!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best I've used. It makes scanning simple and the results are excellent."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far I really 👍 this application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It definitely has a good automatic scanning process. But it is always failed me when I tried to scan a paper with a barcode in it. Although scanning some receipts is good enough, there are many free alternatives out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely awesome! Can't see why anyone would rate this less than five stars"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good to manage"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"after purchase of pro version and testing several scans, it's clear that the ocr aspect is not that great. I tried many scans to find the best resolution and brightness without much luck in improving the ocr recognition. it's quick and easy to use, this was my top choice until I decided ocr was worth it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"😎"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, include PDF support and fast GDrive upload"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"App works great for scanning pages and automatically backing them up to my Google Drive, definitely a let down that the Text Recognition part of it cannot even recognize typed text."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really good surprise. I went in vacation to my parents house and I found plenty of old school pictures in albums ... I was able to scan them all in good quality and store in my phone so that later on I can just transfer in proper storage. Awesome."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not a bad tolo"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Don't even bother... It is an app which doesn't work for free, every single thing requires the premium..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Every document hangs in a loading animation after scanning, with or without ocr. Basically cannot scan anymore :/"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The scanning speed is slow and quality poor."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a dream come true!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Someone only wont to just do mine Accounts wrong in Documents that i work 
hard doing and in achieving great reference towards public if this works i 
will not let this hacker of terror know on the wired in mine phone device 
include mine girl phone to share is an happy more better terms except 
sexual."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good , but if have capture information of the cards it's nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"OCR is not good. Shows barcode/qr screen after scan, even though there's no 
code in the document. Office Lens did it better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does pdf n jpg"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, bought all the premium functions! Please, implement encryption function (password-protection) before the automatic upload to the cloud kicks in (like in Scanner Pro app on iOS).  Just two questions: 1. Does app perform OCR offline on device, i.e. no data is being sent to you? 2. On iOS there is a selection of all language packs and possibility to download them. Does Android app have all language packs pre-installed and the app recognises itself which language is it scanning?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"ok app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Pls tell me how to restore previous purchase. I have paid and using a new 
phone but unable to restore my purchase."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I tried most scan apps: this one is the best. Mostly because of the various 
filtering options, which allow creating a clean PDF that e.g. prints white 
as white and not gray. Apps like Office Lens don't have this or it's 
inferior. One star removed because the filtering, while great, is a bit 
slow. Perhaps you can look into using RenderScript to speed things up."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great can scan and save to cloud storgage or send via text or email."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I've been using ScanBot on iOS for years. After switching to Android, I 
immediately noticed that the app was producing noticably worse 
(grainy/blurry) images, despite the filesizes being significantly larger. 
This is despite the Android device having a *much* better camera. i also 
confirmed that photos taken outside of ScanBot behave as expected. I 
reported the issue to them in September 2017 (11 months ago), with example 
photos, and they confirmed the issue - but it has still not been rectified. 
Disappointing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its great an have had it for i think 3 years now. Only thing that i would 
like to see is the auto focus a bit faster. Thank you!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Just a waste. Better to use camera instead, it won't take extra space on my 
mobile."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"the free version is useless, no OCR"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Been using it for two years now, no problems. Even used it for submitting 
paperwork to a lawyer. Made it really convenient when I was injured and 
unable to drive to some where."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to scan documents and save them to evernote automatically"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool to have available whenever needed. I still have a lot to 
learn, Bu I am happy to have the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It's okay, but does not seem to do a very good job of recognizing the edges 
of documents when scanning. It has cut off a part of every document I've 
Scanned. I regret spending the money on the paid version. Don't recommend 
it. Update: Since writing the above review I have tried both Adobe Scan in 
Microsoft Office Lens. They both work better than Scanbot with Adobe being 
the better of the two. And since both are free as well I would say that 
either one is probably a better choice then Scanbot."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for photo coping your paperwork and sharing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Das war eine Zumutung."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A great app, does what is say's, fast scan and auto upload"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"getting used to the app but seems decent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful app.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Locked up camera on my phone and can't take pictures on my Unrooted Nexus 
6P even though I verified it has access to the camera. Nothing shows up 
except a big red box with multi-page, flash, and automatic buttons on the 
top and an import button in the bottom. No other app, including the built 
in camera app could use the camera again until I rebooted my phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Love that this app auto uploads to dropbox and keeps receipts, documents, 
etc out of my camera roll."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Uninpresed by the free app features. Rather slow and far inferior to 
officelens."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far I love the free version of scanbot. As I use it, might find the need 
to purchase the premium 5.99 version, but for now I am able to scan in 
docs, edit, add send / share with many different programs/cloud- based 
sites, etc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scan my notebook and turn my writing into text. It does not, can not do 
this. The main task it advertise it can not do. All i want is to copy/paste 
my notes to share online. Can't do it. Will have to go and type out my 
notes by hand."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Great app, BUT it crashes all the time when I'm in the middle of scanning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ad free and very feature-full"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for taking pictures of white boards"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"What is the difference between scanbot pro and vip?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"it take dark photo"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"😊👍😊👍😊👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app works as an amazing, office-quality scanner. As a trucker, it fits 
my mobile life to a T. The best feature? It auto-crops, and skews as well, 
so I get a perfect rectangle even if I wasn't directly over the page. Also 
good, you can apply filters... so the page you scanned can be in Black and 
White, so you don't have shadow grayscale on the page. The worst con? There 
is no way to correct the OCR-recognized text. It is what it is, as bad or 
good as it came out. And I've yet to see any OCR document on any program 
that was completely correct with no fixing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great scanner with good cloud integration. Only negative point: bit slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Takes pictures is all I have found so far. So why not call it a picture 
app. Scanning I believe means moving over an object not focusing and 
picture taking."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I got McDonnell play app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and reliable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Help doing my work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really great. Needed this 5yrs ago. Will recommend this app to anybody. You 
would be crazy not to download this app right now !!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it, easy to use for fast scanning and emailing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"New to the app but i like it so far"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use it to keep track of receipts for tax purposes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have used a lot if different scanning apps. Scanbot is the most 
automated, easiest to use and overall best scanner I have ever used. It has 
saved me quite a bit of time and is well worth the purchase price for the 
Pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Still learning the Scanbot, but very interesting so far. Looking forward to 
investigating the rest of its features. Peace!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use and offer a lot of features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tried scanning some product guides, but it failed again and again because 
there were bar codes in the picture, so it just wants to jump to the URL 
instead of just letting me scan the damn image. Edit: I don't want to 
disable QR recognition and then enable it again every time I need to use it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scans are great and easy to use. Awesome app to organize your life."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app, easy to use. But print out come with black shade."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"User friendly GUI with robust integration package."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really like the whole setup of this app, and I love to use it on a daily 
basis. My favorite aspect of it is the auto upload to the cloud. I made a 
folder in my Google Drive named quick scans, and I scan my receipts when I 
get them, auto upload them, then I can just throw them away (or recycle)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast and efficient much better than Office Lens or Adobe scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. Uses are unlimited. Highly recommend it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its nice and usefull app ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Seems to work, but no manual. Too many features left un-explained."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best document scanning app I've tried so far. High quality results, easy to  organize and upload/share."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easiest scanning app I've used that is packed with useful features. I 
highly recommend it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It is really nice.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Perfect app for pdf scanning. No such Ads. Sufficient space for pdf files. 
I like it..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Alright"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Functional, productive and useful!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Cannot seem to be able to move/upload scanned pdf docs to Dropbox. Seems to go thru the motions but nothing appears in Dropbox. Permission has been granted. Folder selected. Nothing happens."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Flawless and quick scanning and saving documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Would be a 6 star rating but the continual asking for more money and I've 
already given 5 bucks is annoying"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super handy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good apps for regular basis useing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This app has the best characters of any I have used. Unfortunately it scans receipts to huge proportions. So a scanned receipt ends up being 19 inches by 56 inches or bigger. If the app did not have such good scans I would have ditched it long ago."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Supar"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Used to be perfect (I have a paid version) and suddenly the developers 
decided remove features to make you pay more. Not honest."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great 😎😃😆"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"100% Fantastic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent scanner application."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"عالی"

really bad."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ok Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just awesome . simple interface and lots of features."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this application. I used it for no more than 5 min and 
purchased the full version! Thank you!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Overall a must have app. I use it on daily basis. But after updating my 
huawei mate 10 lite to Oreo. Unable to use it capture button is not

working again"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Have been using this for long time now and app is great! Fast and easy with

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I Love It....Awesome App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"You have a solid app. Except I had to bump the Stars down due to the very 
long post photo precessing. It takes 15 seconds between me taking the photo 
and me being able to take another one. Why?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Does what is advertised."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Update: Thanks for the reply! This fixed the issue and other issues I have 
been experiencing with other apps. My bad! Rating updated. Original: I

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scans"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Does nothing about uneven exposure in the photos, so the results are ugly  and unprofessional. Also insists on saving to PDF rather than as useful  images. (Apparently I missed the option to save as images; my bad! I'm opinionated but the goal, when writing a review, is to at least stick within the actual facts!  I kicked it up a star, at least.)"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use. Easy to filter for clear text; easy to upload to cloud 
storage (choice between JPG or PDF is great); easy all around. More than 
enough features come with the free version, but the ability to 
edit/annotate/sign new scans or imported docs makes the cost of the pro 
version totally worth it for me."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"App has a lot of features, but they don't come together well and I am constantly searching  for something - often the next step for somethibg.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Very buggy app. Kept displaying random QR codes when I was trying to scan a page from a novel. Apart from this bug, it always prompts to download OCR data at launch."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This is a great, very smart app with very high potential. However, I'm extremely disappointed in the feature disparity between the premium Android version and the premium iOS version. For a cross-platform service, paid teirs should offer the same features across platforms, but the Android version is significantly less functional than the iOS version:  Individual file encryption is essential for enterprise use, as well as an option to lock the app with a passcode or fingerprint. These things are available in the iOS version, and should absolutely be available for paid Android users. Without these types of cornerstones, paid users can get 90% of the features they paid for with most free apps. The premium version needs these types of things to set it apart more from competitors. Adding these features alone would bring tremendous value to the app, and could potentially bring in many more users due to the enterprise appeal.   Additionally, being able to highlight and copy, define, etc. text within the built-in PDF editor would be nice. As it stands, you can only select text in a different PDF editor or by using text mode, in which you don't have the scan as a backdrop. This comes off as a lazy attempt to get *most* of the way there, since the iOS version supports this, and the devs are clearly capable of implementing it. Another notable feature that is very common in competing apps that is omitted in Scanbot is the ability to go back to old scans and edit/re-crop the pages from the original image.  There are too many inconveniences and omissions for this app to be a true competitor with others, especially if you purchase the premium option. A few simple additions could fix most of the issues, so hopefully the developers recognize that and are working on solutions. This app has more potential than most other premium scanners, but it doesn't seize it properly on the Android platform."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best doc scanner on the market. Manual crop function would be good but auto works fine. Auto upload is the best thing ever"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I was looking for a document scanner that could quickly create a document scan with the least amount of app navigation effort as possible and just as quickly get out of my way—because who really wants to deal with a messy and confusing document scanner app UI?  Scanbot is very simple on the surface and gets the job done with ease. After taking a scan,  you can simply tap save and exit. It's just that simple. Of course there are other options you can perform if you want, but for me, all I want is to get in and out as quickly as possible.  The most important features to me, however, is that Scanbot automatically transfers my scanned documents directly to my FreeNAS server via SFTP then deletes the original from my phone afterwards. Scanbot does this perfectly! While other document scan apps may very well accomplish this, I simply love the simplicity to which Scanbot takes care of this task.   So why would I only give Scanbot four stars? The reason is a glaring lack of public key encryption for SFTP. Without this option I am forced to make a compromise in the security of my home server to use Scanbot. If public key is added to the SFTP client, Scanbot will truly be a five-star app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scans so much better than Google drive scan with accurate, near frustration-free scanning. Only issue so far is that some documents don't want to upload for some reason. Spent two hours waiting for ""processing""."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It kept finding phantom barcodes on a document I was trying to scan. Also, every time I tried using the flash, it would automatically cut off the light right before it snapped the pic which resulted in an extremely dark scan."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It worked well for a few days but now anytime I try to scan, the scans get into some kind of in-progress state and they never finish processing. That means I cannot email or print them. And they never show up in my Google documents folder via cloud sync either, even when my phone's connectivity is excellent and I'm on my home wifi network. All of my other apps connect perfectly to the network but this one just can't even give me access to a simple scan. I think it should at least let me email or print it when it's just a photo. Even a reboot of the phone did not work. I was in a situation where I needed a scan right away so i had to switch to TinyScanner and that worked immediately."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"absolutely right"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scans are not near the quality of other apps I've used like CamScanner and Adobe Scan. Just takes a picture of the document. Doesn't offer any auto-enhamcements after editing and it's not an intuitive process to find these enhancements."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far free version gives you basic tools but very useful. Would give 5 stars but they didn't give anything in the free. (Themes being unlocked) would have got my 5th star. Maybe I'll buy on payday...keep up the good work."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App wont let you test the paid features unless you buy. This is a scam because if it worked well they would let you at least test out the text recognition which is essentially the only thing that matters. They say they let you try it for free but the free version is just a glorified camera with no way to test the text recognition. Dont give your money to scammers, and beware most of these paid reviews."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"the app dose what say it dose but I don't understand why it needs my health data my contacts and microphone and Callander to scan documents.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love using Scanbot for scanning receipts on the go. I don't usually have much success with the OCR functionality though, but that isn't a feature I've had need of as of yet. What I really love is when you set up how you want the receipts to look after scanning, it remembers it, and all other receipts require little to no finalizing afterward."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its awesomed"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app produces good quality scans. However, it only saves in the .pdf format."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great apk"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Feature request to allow OCR to attempt to set date of filename. This would make filing my expenses great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"nice feature,but the camera glitch on android 6.0.1,i want to take a pic the cam wont show after i grant the permission,what the hell? and yeah,fulll feature for some place in the village like me,it's expensive for me 😂"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scanbot cannot be opened by regular computers so that is a BIG problem."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good app to keep records."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a superb app for those who can't not afford scanner printer"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I could not use it, very unfriendly interface. When you are taking shots the active screen shakes around, and you dont really know when to shoot. Always adds and qr codes pump up. Uninstalled from the 1st moment of use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just perfect! Got rid of my expensive scanner and use this app daily. Super fast."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Best app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"works perfectly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great App! I use this not only for work but for personal use and for sending documents around the world. The Paid version is worth every penny! Pro features should not be free, if you like this app, pay the few dollars and support the continued updates, improvements, better security and ease of use that ScanBot is constantly striving to make. Great job guys!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Dad Bombe"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The auto capture feature is amazing, but the scan quality is not that good!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like it very much!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I dont know"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Usually the perspective alignment jumps around constantly for a long, long time, then the app freezes. Straight lines, including a line of text, get recognized as an edge border. Flash doesn't work: photo is taken just after the light turns off so the photo is pitch black."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Automatic mode is annoying. In manual, constant auto-recognition and moving selection of my image means I cannot simply take an image of a whole A4 page."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's a great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has made my life so much easier! Its fab!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cool App, makes life easier in creating PDF docs, I like it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It is better than Cam scanner app and i loved it.... I am a cam scanner user and due to this app i switched to scanbot app.... At least English OCR feature needs to be free and more languages for OCR needed..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App is not oppenning"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"E pensare che vi ho pure pagato! Ho comprato l'app ancora quando era a pagamento... e ora sono costretto a pagare di nuovo per utilizzare la versione completa? Ma seriamente? Ad ogni modo anche la qualità dello scanner sembrerebbe essere peggiorata, mi sa che è arrivato il momento di cambiare applicazione. Peccato."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app to import multiple camera images of documents to crop and edit all, even then to export all for free!! The app did almost all the work to cropping the document pictures. No premium required except for additional features."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Need better batch-scanning options. This app cannot re-edit colours or crops after saving; cannot use an external camera on my Chromebook - thus this app not number 1 for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good for important documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It good bt still slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Great app! Auto Upload and delete afterwards is fantastic. But: why takes it so much time between two photos? I select ""multi site scan"" and the app loads 10 seconds before I'm allowed to take the second photo... - Nexus 5X"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Once you get used to it its good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Nice scanning app and I like the auto scan and look of the app, but the quality of the scans just doesn't do it for me, and isn't a patch on Camscanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Idk"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Quality, Fast Scans. A Must Have App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Lucky"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I needed something simple. This isn't simple, not anymore. And the app crashed after i scanned 15 pages. Wasted time, I'll search for something better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"One of my favourite apps but having used the IOS version extensively, the android version falls short of expectations.  It would really be helpful if they can add the ability to import PDF files rather than just images."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb app with best quality. Fully automatic. Highly satisfied with service. Well done snapbot."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app often crashes somtime it doesn't works. So please update this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, best support ;-) Had an issue with my phone, which was my mistake (had some funky system option enabled) and support spotted the issue with the first response and presented me a solution. Keep on doing great stuff Scanbot team!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I don't know what else it does but it scans and uploads to Google Drive.... The automatic multiple system makes it the best app I have ever used."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great and lovely app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"FAQ  says pull down ""document menu"" to get started. I dont see where that is. When I open it and put the document I want in the camera frame it says ""Use clean background.""  This is the document I want, there is no cleaner background.  Cant tell if I am in frame. Was able to get an image, but it looks like a picture and not a scan. Black borders from my desk mst. What happened to ""automatically detect the borders""? First to say my experience with technology is limited  but I dont find this app intuitive at all and instructions are hard to find. This is a 1. Congratulations to those of you who can make it work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App won't open anymore. Found a new one made by microsoft."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tries to find the edges of the document its self and fails miserably. I ended up with multiple copies of a distorted half document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner app I've used!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"One of the first apps I was looking for was a scanning tool with reliable image capture, text recognition and high-quality PDF/JPG export.  Scanbot packs almost all of these fearures as well as quick page corner detection, de-skewing, and handy filters to make the final result legible, sharp, and ace-high quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Seamless upload to a wide number of cloud storage services makes this app stand out from others, and this feature is available in the free version! A real time saver."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good for text..this is what I need...easy to use.  Immediate sharing is very useful..thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice, easy to use design. very handy. Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wish there was more for the free version, all in all a good app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works very well"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice App anb gret use app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I can't access the files and I keep coming back to the camera. Back then it was easy to access those by simply swiping upwards. I can't also exit the app. Please update and fix it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love the way this app works. Integrates with all my cloud services. Very easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it.. help me a lot"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Change website permissions"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"its simple, its easy, its efficient.  and thats everything i want from a scanner. grrrrrrreat!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Needs a lot of improvement"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very polished. Delightful animations. Superb distortion and color correction. Supports multi-document scans and most major cloud storage services."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's a beautifully designed app, but the quality of the scans and the auto filter process is no where near CamScan's capability. The automatic and immediate file uploads to cloud storage and deletion is done very well though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Still the capture is problematic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Initially I had only very good OCR results of English text. Umlauts were not recognised. When scanning text in several languages, these languages need to be added in Androids Language settings.  After fixing this problem the app gets 5 stars."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"For those who want to save their files online, the flood of paperwork that comes with life such as bills, insurance, medical and more, this app is a life saver!  I can easily upload a PDF of any document, even multiple pages as a single document, with just the simple act like taking a picture!  Simply hold the phone over the page, then verify the app took the proper picture. If you buy the full version you even get text recognition, which is great for those bills thst only occur once in a while BUT have a"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Clean design, simple and easy to use, and gets the job done, even without the pro version. I really like the ""perspective"" feature which recognizes the shape of the paper- great idea. I love the app. Thank you for making this!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works better than googles version"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"For old paper it was not working prop early"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app is not good at all. The scanned images are dull and not clear. Also the filters are not very useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome scanning app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"it makes food. OCR doesn't work it needs pro version. hated it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Too good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Could be better. The conversation is fine however.... You need to change the way you import images for scanning. I had 102 documents to convert to multi page pdfs. So that is a lot of photos to import, importing each image one by one and not in a multiple batch is a very time consuming task, this is made worse by the fact that every time you import a photo it goes back to the same screen of choices, where i have to select gallery, scroll to my folder, selet that, scroll down hundreds of photos and select one more photo. At least have the program go back to the exact same position, its  not hard to memorise the last folder and scroll position.  Cheers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good App..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app every time I need to register expenses! It's great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scanner. It takes a lot of ressources and appears to stop working while it processes the files but everything goes back to normal after the file is processed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This was highly reviewed, so I immediately purchased the upgrade for the OCR. DO NOT BUY! It works okay for taking pics, but the OCR is worthless. Wish I could get a refund."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really simple and well thought scanning process!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app keeps crashing for no reason and it's annoying since I just paid and unlocked all the features. Terrible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good best yet"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The free version gets the job done and paid extras are worth if you really need them... better than other apps."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Would have bought it but the major problem to me is lack of privacy. You use Google Search to find data in private scans on my own phone. Every other scanning app I own use a local search. And no encryption option so all cloud data is not private. Other apps offer automatic PDF etc... Encryption. Even in this day and age people have documents they would like to keep private. Fix this atuff and I will buy the app as what I tried was well set out but until then no sale."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for scanning documents.No watermark is printing on scanned doc in trail version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Using this on my BlackBerry Passport, and it works great, my first choice would have been ""office lens"", which crashes and doesn't work on my Passport, but I tried this app and it works great"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"No ocr. Need to pay for it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Okay"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I was using this to store my receipts then without notice it started trying to open the Walmart app instead of scanning with no way of overriding. If I wanted to scan my receipts into the Walmart app I would have installed the Walmart app. I just want an app that saves my receipts as pdf. Fix this and my rating goes back up to five."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I am Groot. I am Groot. 😀👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app for brains"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"pro ???  Always slow and OCR problem !!! bad app !!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Looks like a 5yo made it.   While okay, and does kinda what it says, if you use the free version.   Don't pay for it though. Absolutely horrible. So many free apps do the job a thousand times better than this app does for $6.   No ability to enter text onto scans.   Forced to 'write' with your finger.  adding a signature was the only real feature I wanted to use it for, and that feature is behind the premium features. Which also could be improved drastically.  Their feature that promised to read / extract the contents of the document into a notepad style format is horrid and couldn't barely get words simple words right. Tested with multiple documents in varying light. Still absolutely horrible despite perfectly clear image."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"All I'm looking for is a good OCR scanner. For that, I would gladly pay money. Without that, the program is no better than Google keep, which has more free features. Hiding your only important feature behind a paywall is pretty short-sighted. It was enough for me to uninstall without worry."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Good App when it works. Just keeps shutting down. Hasn't improved even after the update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App is broken, I can't get half my combined documents to save properly, all the app keeps saying is ""Queued"", auto Dropbox sync is not working half the time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I simply can enter to the documents manager, it's frustrating! Great app but with some problems, or at least in my phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Not as good as CamScanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"After 2 yrs in my phone and several major changes between updates, I'm uninstalling this app. I still don't get why they removed manual frame correction. Automatic mode or not, it's bloody frustrating to get a nice shot of the page. Results are blurred, skewed and it takes 5-6 attempts to get it right, and that's only per one page. Imagine having to scan 30 pages - it would take a whole hour. Startup is very slow. Tiny Scanner beats this app by a mile."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice little scanner app with many cool features like multiple filters to create smooth and crisp images after cleaning. This app stands out because of the amazing quality images it produces with minimal effort, really! justifies 5 star. Although this app actually gave in after ~100 pages for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Try and see first"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Well it does exactly what I wished for before I began download...... Try it best for now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scans suck I have a 16 megapixel pxel can and it blows"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good scanning, but no ""one button"" tap to email the results to my admin. Also, scan naming needs more special variables, like name of nearest locale, or an easier way to insert the location. (too many taps to do so right now)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. Hope to see few more cool features in future. 5 🌟"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's very very bad but camscaner is very very good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this easy to use app and have recommended to all my friends and colleagues"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"What is wrong with your app... It landed me on scanbot pro on opening it for first time...how come one will purchase this app without being able to use it..  waste...!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Super!  The Best ever!  ;-)  MN"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Due to some reason cam scanner was not working on my phone and this is the best alternative for that, in some area its even better than that!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome scanner app best in store"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid to have OCR but ended up using a free one since OCR on this is not really reading it good for the same import photo I use on Text Fairy's OCR. OCR text can't be editted also. Also cannot combine photo and text on same pdf."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really fast reply from app developer. Thanks for reply. Actually I want to say that The app Creates separate folder for each scanned document. But It would be better if app scanned all documents to image in a single  folder, so it will be easy to view from gallery."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"fantastic software very useful and easy to use..scans perfect and perfesional"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's very good app all"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The text on scanned documents appears blurry in the previews even after multiple attempts. It turns out that the pdf file itself when opened in a separate app looks just fine so this appears to just be a glitch in the preview view, but still this is something that needs to be fixed soon. I use this app with a Galaxy S7 edge."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best PDF scanner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, did exactly what I needed - scan documents in batch mode (one after another) and then save all in single pdf file then upload to Dropbox. Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanner for Android."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scans are not cached and sometimes when scanning multiple pages, scanned pages are lost.  RE: after I lost pages, I had checked if it might be caused by closing the app. However I don't recall closing the app myself and I don't have any running app manager. That's why I mention caching scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does for you what the other apps have you do... It's automagic!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Disappointed  with the quality of the ocr and the quality of the picture"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Extremely finnacky to use and UI broken after update  Continually prompts me to either ""move closer"" or ""don't move"" each time I try to make a scan, for a minimum of 30 seconds before it actually take the photo. Also clicking ""cancel"" if it makes a bad scan doesn't cancel the scan, it just goes back. I have to restart the app to make a scan after messing a single page up."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Installed on LG Stylo 2 with ""Nougat"". Open app and 5 photos appear. The only thing I can do is scroll through the pictures."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works very well so far. Somebody in comments complained there is no rotation. The rotation is included."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It's not free even though it says it is. The only thing I see in the upper left hand corner is a link that says, ""restore purchases""."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've already bought this with the add-ons for my iPad and I see on the Android version there's an option to pay a bit more for 2 copies.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Oh yeah,  the paid version no longer functions; crashes on launch. Disappointed. After getting the Pro version - Optical Character Resolution (OCR) is so poor that, I'm certain it does nothing. Further more, normally standard tools such as rotate is absent. I'm not understanding after the company had created the app they didn't figure a document might need to be rotated! Therefore, the Pro version isn't worth it because it's really worthless as a Pro version. 03122017"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app is pretty good. I like the way it works. However I'm bit unhappy somewhat because of frequent crashes. It crashes so frequently (most of the times after 3/4 scans), let alone batch scanning.😨 And also some images get automatically cropped which isn't expected.😩 Please fix these problems.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Love it except for a major issue - I can't find out how to save small receipts in a way that does not save it at A4 size. They look massive when viewed on laptop or printed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easier to use than Office Lens"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Awesome app for quick scanning on the go. There is some room for improvement though. OCR and consequent upload take very long (even on WiFi) and automatic shutter is too sensitive (takes blurry scans often)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Very much trouble photographing a document. Enough light, white paper on a darker surface and it will not give a good scan result. Half of the time it grabs half of a document. And allot of times when I use the app the result is a black screen.  Edit I have send an E-mail to you guys!"

Then I select multiple jpg scanned document and click on ""Merge document"" to make it single pdf. But its saving output file in Jpg format in place of single pdf file. When I click on merged JPG output file then it never open, just showing rotating loading icon. Jpg merged output file is corrupt.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It makes perfect copies of receipts and documents that are very clear. The tools that come with the ap are handy. The only one I need to use every once in a while is ""crop"", and that's easy to do. I made a folder on my SD card for ""Scanbot"" with another ap that adds the option of sending something to my SD card within the general ""Share"" function, and that's where I send the files when I'm done, or to a specific folder I've put inside the Scanbot folder, plus they go to Google Drive. Scanbot is really a fantastic and useful ap. Get it! When you need it, you'll be glad you have it. 2/18/17 Update: finally convinced my husband he needs this ap after he sent me photos of two previously folded documents that were a mess. I was supposed to forward them. I did, after rotating them a few times, but the person who received them couldn't open the files. This grew less & less professional. I had to spend 45 minutes turning them into jpg & trying to make them more legible. By then, the woman had gone home, so she didn't get them until the next day. Humm. If he'd only had ScanBot..."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very usefulness ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Rely useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very convenient for scanning full-size, multi-page documents. Has replaced a complicated workflow involving camera and computer and too many steps.  There's just one flaw, but it's an annoying one: there's no exposure compensation, so white documents, which are the norm, come out gray. Would love to see a default compensation of about +1.3, maybe adjustable via slider. This is not hard, people! (Even the standard Android camera app has exposure compensation.)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"App does exactly what it should do - scans the documents and sends them to the cloud chosen by you."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ez to use scanner... very useful!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good scanning app with nice features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect app.. only concern: placement of the ""Done"" button. Either takes too long to go back to the prior screen and I press it again, which ends up in me hitting cancel that's in the exact same location of the previous screen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"OCR feature use less not easy to use. I purchased pro version. Capture image quality poor then direct camera app image."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Hello, thanks for developing this app. It works great and does what it should do correctly. My only gripe is that for the last 2 months or so, the app randomly crashes in the background, even when I haven't used/opened the app for few days. Can you please fix that. The crashing irritates as it happens once almost everyday. I have been filing bug reports in hopes that that gets fixed, and I must have done that about 10 times by now. I am using Nexus 6p using the lastest stock OS (7.1.1)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"First impression was great, better than other apps I've tried, payment is reasonable. Only problem I have is how to share my copy as I purchased the VIP. There were no follow up instructions..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Doesn't detect camera properly, doesn't work with uploaded photos, and hits you with a paid version right away.  Junk."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is not worth your time, Adobe Fill And Sign offers way more for free, unlike this junk that pushes pro version for minimum $7 just to do anything more than take a simple picture of a document, it just makes the process pretty with its bright buttons, that's it, useless app, AND it pushes the upsell of the ""pro"" version every time you touch anything! So frustrating, it just ""laughs"" at you for using the free version with rude remarks like when you want to keep using free version you are forced to click"" I don't want to be a Pro"", basically. Disgusting! Away with it, this instant! MS Office is waaay better plus Adobe Fill and Sign - which is truly state of the art."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Why does this app need access to my contacts and refuses to take pictures unless I give access? I really don't want you to spam all my contacts."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Could someone tell me how to get the pro version of the pro features of this app. ?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple and able to adjust slanted image to square....."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Accurate, clean, and fast."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exellent program!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I am not able to import more than one photo from gallery. I want a combined photos made in a single pdf file. After pressing import button, I can choose only a single image from gallery. Then page1 button is seen. The developer is not explaining how to insert image for second page. It only forces me to take a camera shot."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It seems not to be possible to safe the scan results anywhere but the already designated folder. And if I understood the FAQ section it will not be for a while if at all. Renders it useless for me, money down the drain."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I reckon it's the best available in the market. Cheers"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Latest version seems unable to restore my purchase. Pressing Restore purchase just do nothing. Also, it now has trouble cropping all the documents I try to scan, I must crop them manually most of the time."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When I test an app to see if I want to use it, I like to be able to use the app. Not try to turn off the sales pitch. If you like sales pitches, 5 stars. If you want to see the layout, work flow and capabilities, zero stars. Save yourself the frustration. TINY SCANNER PRO"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I must be really dumb. When starting app, the only thing that works is a slideshow to upgrade for the paid version. Update: nevermind I found the slider on the last page."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The app cant import multiple images. Only 1. Then the next page will have no import option and only have camera capture button. Basically if you want multiple pages you have to do it on the app rather than taking pictures of documents then importing on the app. By the way ive been using scanbot for years on ios and android. This is the 1st time im gonna import multiple images of documents. i have to redo taking puctures within the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I liked it !!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've tried at least 5 scan apps, this is the best. Syncs with Google Drive in the free Version and creates great scans! Carry on the good work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I upgraded to the ""pro"" version, and the results were still unfocused and blurry.  I feel I have been robbed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scans just looked like a low quality photo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Can copy text from image"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I got pay version (PRO), but ocr I though don't works. But when save as PDF, I could extract text. DOO  must update support documentation, version 6.5  extract text different way like support suggests."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use  as well as easy to cutomize."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Though I choose this app to replace my usual scanner. I am happy it bracket automatically the document. But I am not okay with camera performance it didn't adjust the brightness level and over exposed if document under direct lite."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Neat and clean UI. In top ten must have app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's quite ok but I started occupying much space in my phone"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought this a while back, but now it only seems to open as Scanbot Lite, and keeps suggesting i upgrade to Scanbot Pro... And it won't restore my original purchase? What gives? Is this some dodgy scam to make me buy twice?"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Verygood"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been using Scanbot for 2 years and all is good. However, recently when I tried to find one of my scans, I noticed many scans had disappeared. Then I tried to search for it in the saved folder but couldnt locate that folder either, though I followed the address in settings. Any suggestions how I can find my scan? It's very important."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ho sempre amato l'interfaccia originale e versatile dell'app sin dalla prima release. uttavia la mia ultima recensione era da 2 stelle per la scarsa reattività e alcuni comportamenti ""poco smart"" della applicazione. Curioso di vedere i progressi nello sviluppo ho scoperto con gran piacere che è diventata molto responsiva, i filtri sono migliorati tantissimo e sono state curate alcune raffinatezze nel cropping che non solo hanno risolto i vecchi problemi ma lo hanno reso il migliore mai provato.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It sucks battery life.  If the paper has the slightest crease, it's unable to focus to take the scan.  If the lighting isn't right it won't scan.  If a bug sneezes in Finland, it won't scan. So frustrating."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Download it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ease of use and built-in ocr, superb app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app works really well for me. Compared to other document scan apps this one offers the best features. There are just 2 things missing for a 5 star rating. 1) when I use the flash and take the photo manually from the app, the image sometimes ends up completely black. And 2) please add an option to select the OCR language, independent from the system language. Would really love it if you guys could implement 2)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Well if possible please try to give edit feature for free...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Try to scan something, it takes a picture, then hangs. Force close the app after which camera remains blocked (not just for this app) until reboot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome😀"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"An option to instantly save the edited picture to your gallery to then use/attach to emails would be super. Other than that it's very good but also expensive!"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really helped me at the time of emergency. It is quick and the output is commendable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worthless. Most apps, if the image is grainy, and you tap it to focus... It focuses the picture, and takes it. Scanbot? NOPE! instead, it focuses on the point you clicked.... And cuts the rest of the page out... Of course, the page preview looked fine, and since it makes no distinction or noticeable anything that lets you know its cutting out the top and bottom quarter of your document, you send this BS ""scanned"" document to the government, and are subsequently withdrawn from the hiring process. 🖕🖕"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I loved it this app.perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Wo ist die Druck/Print Funktion? Soll da ein Witz sein?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"5 stars only if the app allows to import pdf's too."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Took 10 pics in one PDF and when I open it just shows me blank page"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Crap"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I had to uninstall/reinstall this app to finally get it to work again and, consequently, lost all of my local PDFs."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Oh it used to be so slow compared to Lens. But that's fixed now!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This is my first 1-star rating of an app. So, why did I give it one star? Well, I scanned a bunch a recipes from one of my books. I cropped the images and combined a number of pages and was expecting them to show up on Evernote. They never did. OK, so they did for the first book, but not the next two. I even bought the paid edition, so not only am I out the time and effort to identify the recipes I liked, scan, crop, and combine them, but I am also out cash. It is bad enough that Scanbot kept trying to crop and scan only a portion of each page, now I have to repeat my actions hoping for different results. Perhaps I am insane. I am certainly disappointed with paying to be frustrated."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has made a huge difference in organizing receipts for me.   It is, however,  a very poor Cajun/Israeli fusion  restaurant locator."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"i liked the app but sometimes it doesn't give me the option to buy an plan but idk if its on the connection or from the app but i really like the app 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 thanks for that app you saved my life"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app and have tested about 10 scanner apps for Android. This one has it all: auto-upload, automatic document detection during scanning and OCR."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"While the website scanbit.io claims that Scanbot had SFTP support, the App itself does not offer such. Quite disappointing..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"All the other scanners sucked."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've tried many other apps for mobile scanning. Since I am out on the field and can't always get to the office I need a app that can take a good clear image and convert it to pdf. This by far is the best app for my needs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like it.it is very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been a user of CS for a long time and really like it. Checked this one out today and find it works great. Very nice program. I like the way it saves to external SD so easily. Because of this and the function, it rates a 5*. **UD: Can you help me get around this Android V.6 error with the overlay thing? Their failure keeps me from using your program. Thanks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Samsung Gallery S7. Does everything it says. Comes in handy to make a copy of something you may want to keep. Scan feature is quick and clear to review later. By the way, this one was recommended by Android's Drippler user choice."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its awsum appk"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its beautiful. I love how u shared app features between Pro and free. Both are usable. However most times, to print I edit the contrast to white mode and its always clipping highlights."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scanned 7 pages document...clicked save button...blank page appears... Saving to internal storage notification appears."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It is simply the best but we need to be able to customise the path where the docs are saved in the sd card."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not able to scan the document  from gallery. pls provide  option for that also. Also there is not separate page or button option for ocr. Please provide the same."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It was very nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice scanner. But please please make it easier to save it on phone's gallery."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is great for capturing all sorts of documents from receipts and cards to full size documents. Highly recommended."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good, usefull, easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I purchased this app mostly for the OCR function but it does not seem to work at all. I googled the manual but it must be for Iphone as the interface shown is different to that on my samsung. All up the app it seems completely useless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A lot faster and easier to use than many of the competing apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Dear All please create folder option as for the IOS version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really nice app with a great design that is easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Xulu"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It always fails to save. Always. And it never fails to remind me every 20 or so minutes til I delete the file I tried saving. You have more luck on another 3rd party app, or just cropping a picture and saving it on google drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app, I'm using it for years it's amazing app the auto upload is the best and very useful got my scanned docs folder in my google drive and everything is organized. The scan itself is great and useful. Only one thing and that's the reason for the 4 stars: Please bring the amazing old icon back!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Have used a lot of scanning & paper-to-digital apps, this one is currently way ahead, captures handwriting in detail you can read, finds page edges precisely & saves quickly without need to sync online (though the onedrive integration is brilliant) Keep up the awesome work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"top app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have no idea why the scans look weird, like a bad photocopies. Photos automatically gets processed... There is no option to set it to original 😑 Filter or whatever that option is, colour versions look extremely dark... Uninstalled and started using Camscanner instead!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Best one out there"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a couple of months, and think it's generally excellent: good features, image quality, and most of all, very efficient to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for reducing daily paper, keeping receipts, and saving  reference material."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I needed the pro because of ocr. Ocr is just down right terrible to the point it is unusable for me. OCR is one of those things where you get it right or just leave it. I thought for 6€ you would get something that actually works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love the design/layout & ease of use of Scanbot. In my opinion it's the best scanning app on Google Play, hands down. It runs flawlessly on my HTC One M9 running Android 5.1 and I haven't experienced a single bug in months if using this app. I gladly paid to get the pro features and support the developers for making such a great app. Scanbot is a 5 star app, for sure!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The previous icon was awesome, bring it back."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"But why did they remove the cute icon of Scanbot which was before and looked very asome and cute."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bakwas app hate it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This new version not restoring my PRO status, what's wrong???"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I will miss the old cheerful icon though!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for over a year and even paid to have the full version. I like to ease of use an automatic upload to Google drive. I sent one of my scan documents to a colleague at work and the quality of the PDF was much lower than the quality I was seeing in the app. The page was a dark grey on the computer screen where is it was nice and white on the app. I am annoyed that there isn't a 'select all' button to delete all of the documents that I previously scanned. It's time to try something new"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works every time.Very professional."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great application. Easy to use. Accurate..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"..independently by the background color! In that, Microsoft Lens or Scanner PRO are on another planet compare to you."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app helped me so Mitch in school thanks for making this wonderful app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"App very useful in submitting assignments for students"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"but only thing missing is ability to crop taken images after saving them"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice and high quality scans"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just loaded on new galaxy phone. Much easier to use than my iOS version. Thanks for making on- the- road reports much easier to file."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Things got easy when have this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Like"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This has been a good productivity app for me so far. It has its glitches like not recognizing the documents and taking a while to focus. Overall though, I'd recommend this app to others."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works impressively on Xperia Z3. Efficient and effective. No need for any other app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome and simple"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Your app is wonderful!! Works Great, just as described! BUT as experienced user I INSIST... PLEASE CONSIDER the age of your ANDROID prior TO RATING IT! Apps from this day forward, running on Android 6&gt; or older (less than 6) this App is not at fault!! Sorry if you are locked in s contract... caiseyou are  definitely are running out of timeid 4.6 an seemed ... It's not the droid verquick to rate this App as poor?? I know from experience it is no when its being subjected to woor personally attest to being ke"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"With Scanbot I can sit at my desk and produce pdf files without have to walk to the scanner, load the document into the scanner, walk back to my desk, start the scanner software on my pc,  walk back and take the document out of the scanner and walk back to my desk. Simple and easy!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and send pdfs, no watermark is great too!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot has all functions of normal scanner and is fantastic to have fit in your pocket."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its very good at creating scans, but your comment about finding folder that stores the scans is most helpful, but I don't yet find the LAN share from within your APP. Will try later. Oddly PDF scans don't show up in ASUS file manager, but I can now navigate to them all."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like it and it is simply."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Used CamScanner for years but been looking for an alternative. This has proved itself far more reliable and packed with more features than rivals. I will use for a few months before deciding to get premium version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"My phone heats up while using the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Physical scanners no more"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So that we can enhance images using other software on laptop for better printouts"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"But export is pretty annoying and definitely needs a redo. I want to easily say what format I want for a scan and where to save it and don't use only these cumbersome presets which I can't even abort and where it's unnecessarily difficult to change them. I want something where I say ""export"" and show the presets but also give a simple way to modify them, like with a drop down menu. So when it says export as PDF to internal storage both format and directory can be changed. And exports need to be abortable!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wonderful.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"But the description implies it can OCR docs and make them searchable. It doesn't. I'm looking for an app I can quickly scan and do a search later that'll find text within the doc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The app tells you everything about anything u scan..oh yeah"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good 6 star"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app with a very friendly interface"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It can take forever to get focus on a picture or name card sometime even if the background is fine. Also, the fact that the team asked for 5 stars in the app and kind of ""mentally coercing"" users in giving only one rating, 5 stars, is the very reason why they already lost one in my count. They lost another one due to a mix of difficulty focusing: even if this is my camera's fault (according to the company), I would have expected the app to correct some of the flaws in my hardware - I have a Galaxy Note 4 - not that crappy as far as I know. AlsoI have noticed that the app sometimes never succeeds in uploading my scans to the cloud. I end up with an infinite waiting loop on some scans, and I have to rescan (if I have the time). This is very frustration. Hence the average rating..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The best scanner I've ever seen"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Force closes always!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does an excellent job of scanning documents on mobile or tablets! Highest quality of scans!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"And they still show the ad?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"...over 200 pages to meet deadline today and pages never saved. Shows the 200 pages plus but when trying to open pages, it's blank. Very , very fustrated. If you have a huge deadline, don't trust this app. Unless there is a way you can recover what was scanned?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It stopped suddenly in note 4 is very annoying. I think I will use a Pro but maybe should stop"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Work made play"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Trully Loved it guys ...very easy to use great job guys"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing app.  Worth the paid version :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"All"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's ok for quick docs capture. The file comes out a little dark and cannot convert to word doc for editing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately, the auto page/crop detect is to much of a pain for me. Everytime i scan a page it crops it to much and i lose text. Yes, i have tried a dark background behind the paper, but if my paper sheet has a box drawn on it, it crops to.that box. Needs a setting to turn off auto detect/crop and make this an option to crop after scanning.  I HAVE GOT CONFIRMATION FROM THE SUPPORT TEAM YOU CANT TURN THIS OFF!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I was skeptical due to some of the prominent negative reviews but there must be something wrong with those people or their hardware. This only needs the ability to add pages to existing scan, to rename documents before or after upload, and folder organization options. Still a 5-star product as is!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It says it's sent documents in emails, or uploaded them to Dropbox, gdrive, Facebook even, but it never does anything. When I check my email there was never anything sent, nothing ever shows up in my gdrive or Dropbox folders."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It takes nice clear photos but it crashes sometimes & when it does crash you have to reboot your phone to use it again. Overall it's a great scanner & it can save the scans onto a memory card, as I don't have much storage space this feature helps me. Also customer support is good. I do like it but only 4 stars because of the crashing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is so simple, and it does everything for you... love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bought the pro version on recommendation of friend using iPhone version. Not good experience. Not able to take any scans as just crashes every time. Requesting a refund"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just great!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Would have purchased if allow to try free version for longer with full usage"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unable to get to scan huge headline after 12 tries. waste of time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really good app. The auto sizing works for the majority of the time but a full manual mode would make this 5 stars. Easy sync with cloud services (and not just Dropbox or just one drive, all the services are available)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Oh golly, what a terrible experience ! ... I needed 10 attempts to get a decent scan of a single page. Auto detection is the main source of frustration. I wish I could turn it off."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Sometimes unreliable. Not many other options though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wowww"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Lovely enjoyable experience everything you need"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not working after the last update... The scans are terrible!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Auto detection terrible and cannot find anywhere to turn it off. As previously mentioned, I can also get better quality just using the phones camera app. Personally right now I find FastScanner the best, but it wouldn't take much to get me to switch. I personally get better quality and greater success just using the camera. Now I need an app that I can cut / paste / add pages / convert and catalog. Hats off to you for the app, it's just not working for me. I'm old and tremble, auto detection a nightmare :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Pretty neat. Great interface. Why I don't use it much: Quality of photos is worse than native Camera app and others (Nexus 6). Takes longer than taking photo (crop usually off, etc)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good ! It works!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Dude"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best I found among many. I wanted auto-crop, easy multi-page, OCR PDF, save to SD card, upload to Google Drive.  This app (I bought the pro version) does that.  I could nitpick personal preferences, maybe interface, etc.  But among the many Android scanner apps, this met my needs the best.  I tried several - here are the ones I remember.   MS Office Lens: didn't save (easily) to google Drive.  Text Fairy extracted text very well, but isn't designed for the needs I mentioned.  Genius Scan was close, but no OCR (yet).  CamScanner - I forget, but didn't match this one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"pressed button ""become a pro"". app crashed. wow. asks me to use my calendar while attempting to save my scans. why? doesn't save scans to my device automatically. cpu burns up to 85°C while app is running."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"quick capture"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect. Just perfect."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scan quality is excellent and it uploads everything to my Dropbox automatically."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app does perfectly what it is named for, scan documents and make a file out of them."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I see only a black or white screen and nothing seems to work. My camera works perfectly when not used by the app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Convenient"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Have been using Google drive but definitely better quality. Not as straight forward as drive but better functionality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Enough said"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"OCR leaves much to be desired. I was going to switch from camscanner pro to Scanbot pro for the paid lifetime license, but after trying out the free version (with ads) and testing it on a few documents, I can say I am less than impressed. The search continues."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When you add to an existing pdf it locks up the old document and destroys it.  Avoid. The update today has the same bug. No new updates since Aug 6, 2016."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Very problematic. Cannot tell difference between white receipt and brown background. Takes up to 20 attempts to get a clean document.  (Developer: I just sent email with attachments.)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love to know how it works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Better than all others I have tried! Get the Pro version, it's well worth it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need. Nice and simple to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works quickly, does the job. Fair advertisements (choose to turn on or off), quality scans and extensive support documentation."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best! It works great with Dropbox. I use it to scan PDFs to it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Amazing  app but lack importing multiple images from galry. Plz add this option too..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy to use.one of the great android scanner. Thanks developers"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Sometimes it is hard to navigate to where the images get stored. A little more help with some of the menu choices would be nice. But the things I have used it for have worked really well. Four stars is the best I can do."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app does exactly what I need it to. It stores all kinds of documents and receipts that I later need for my bookkeeping. I hate keeping track of lots of tiny pieces of paper."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Auto upload disables everytime ... ...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Able to scan almost anything.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and a must have for the  digital age!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Slow to scan, picky and finicky. I found this app because it's one of the only Google Docs supported add-ons. I was hoping this app would let me insert my scans into documents, but only allowed it's very wrong,  cryptic, alien translation."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I love it because it works."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I have only one issue with this app; it can't combine more than one document in one file. Otherwise, it is such a great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice scanner for android"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This gives even better scanning than my actual scanner awesome app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"פשוט, קל, מהיר. ויעיל!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Is smart, pro to support. It's really smart. Try it first."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Every time I use it on my Galaxy S 7, it says I need to use a clean background. Doesn't matter which background I use it just won't work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I was scanning about 20 pages into a single pdf file, and by mistake pressed the back button n the app closed n all stuff i had to repeat again..I would request for an exit confirm option before closing the app..Thank u."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Text doesn't let you pick it and use it in title. Saving to third party cloud storage is clunky if you want to select different folders. Disappointing after paying for this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really love this app, it has definitely saved me a lot of time, besides its (many) functional options it's really well made and easy to use. Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Or is there any way to set the result brightness? Thanks! // Yes I did try those filters but actually I only needes simple brightness settings as it seems the picture taken by this app is darker than it is. Cmiiw."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is one of the most constantly used app and it works great. Also they seem to be very active in updating the app. Really great work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easily creates perfectly cropped and balanced black and white images for expense reporting."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"All the features and utilities you would expect."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great for adding details"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nothing to see here, just updating my review for a good app. The recognition could use some work though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Would like to see owncloud in the cloud providers, going to be setting up my server soon, I think I could use webdav with a plug in but if there's a fully native way that integrated the tagging systems that would be 10x better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A Must Have! It makes keeping receipts for taxes easy. It makes printed pictures look better than in ""real life""."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Bagus banget daripada yg lain. Lanjutkan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb app! With awesome UI and easy to use look. Also the most appropriate and perfect app for image ro pdf! hope you guys will continue making it more amazing!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Didnt expect such feature rich app will recommend it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Help to all doc"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like scanning and being able to upload automatically to google drive ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for productivity while on the move"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really useful and simple"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does the job and easier to use. Recommended."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I purchased pro a long time ago. Now the app is full of ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The icon is so cute!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Tried at least 20 top rated scanner apps. All required tons of manual steps for OCR and export. This just gets the job done without wasting my life time with repetive clicks."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"DO NOT UPGRADE--It is Useless for any practical purposes as OCR does not work.  I paid for the upgrade to get the OCR (text recognition). However, if I copy and paste text from a scanned document, I get words interspersed with a bunch of text and symbols relating to formatting.  So this app is completely worthless for me.  I could spend hours troubleshooting, but I paid for convenience."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"#edit: approval Problem was due to a diferent app with ""overlay"" working normal now but still much slower than it used to be :(  I deleted all AppData because it was unuseable but now I can't approve the camera usage. This is really becoming a pain"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It is a good app but it frequently crashes on my phone which requires a reboot. It woks well for the first scan or two and then it freezes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"like scanner and file retention built into one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to app for scanning. Reliable, quality, good sharing integration.  I just need to get into the habit of using it more!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast and simple plus all features unlocked by one time payment."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Multiple scanned documents are problematic in mailing them because of it's size. So a feature to break docs into sharable sizes may be added."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Have used all the top document scanners and this was average in usability, it opens your camera instantly and then keeps it open all the time. Worse is the over processing of the image with high contrast making the document look fake"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great Scanning App, but please, please port UNFADE to Android. Its much better for scanning old photos ;-)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can't scan at all since last update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic features -- 1. A mode for automatic detection and click plus multipage pdf option (a blessing for quick-users) 2. Perspective adjustments/corrections like a charm 3. Quick Cloud upload to dropbox"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The only thing stopping from purchasing the pro version in fact is because everytime I try to open a scanned file within the app it crashes, but since I'm on Android N developer preview 4 I'm gonna have to wait for the stable build to see if the bug still persists."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Rating downgraded: Folder support was supposedly in the product pipeline as per a message exchange on their facebook page - from September 2014!!! Takes way too long. I've bought the pro version 2 years ago and have since scanned 150+ documents, without folder management the app is only half as useful as anticipated. A real pity."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"In the current version very crash-happy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Hi scanbot team, I read on your website that the pro section of the app  allows us to select beautiful themes. Here the themes mean the look and feel of the app or can I select a theme for my scanned document? Looking forward for your reply"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Just gave up and uninstalled this app. All I wanted to do was scan to PDF and save it on my phone and then be able to drag and drop onto my desktop computer. No cloud storage wanted or needed. Would not do this simple task, it's gone.    Update 5-16-16  I was impressed to get a response from the developer and sent them an email on April 24 requesting information on how to save the scan without using the cloud. It is now May 16 and I have not heard back from them so I assume it's just feel good BS for the folks who read these reviews. Thanks for wasting my time."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Creates great quality images and pdfs. Great features such as image manipulation, auto-upload, and OCR.

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've tried most of the major scanning apps (cam scanner, TurboScan, Google, tiny scan...)  and this is my favorite scanner in terms of ease of use. The scans are easy and simple, they come out clear, and I can scan much faster then ever. It does crash at times for me and I find camscanner  has more features yet Scanbot is easier and faster."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Pro version owner - it seems as it cannot properly identify the document,keeps focusing the camera all the time and at the end the documents are cropped. Disappointed with the app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought pro previously, now that's gone and I have to pay again? Or I'm missing a solution somewhere?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great tool, I REALLY like it and it helped me a lot going paperless. If I can ask one feature request: make a fast scanning mode, where you can scan continuously somehow, only touching the screen when you need to save intermittently. I have made a LEGO brick tower at just the perfect height to lay my cell-phone in while charging. From there, I can scan quite fast, but this ""mode"" would be even more perfect then."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"If you need to turn a lot of paper into PDFs, this app is a lifesaver."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this for both personal and work purposes. I may never use my scanner on my printer again."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This makes library work so easy!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not good at all"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I thought this was fantastic already, and just now found out it even has a slack integration."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"自动切边很不错"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I work as a field rep so an app that can scan documents via a smartphone is great. Just one problem, with 6.0 it stinks. I tried to scan in a 5 page document, lagged  up. Nothing ready after 5 minutes. I would only recommend using this app with Android 5.0 or earlier."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it! Very easy to use!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This apps is an ultimate apps in case of document scanner and pdf maker OCR. I downloaded dozen of apps for this purpose among them I found this app most appropriate for my job. Thanks to developer's for developing such a great app. Wish more in future. I like continuous scan and auto document detection feature most."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Finicky and lacking in features"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"CamScanner is better"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Ads into app"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"فوق العاده"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app ever 😀😃😃😄"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and easy app for scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"There's no or very less tilt in the scanned image"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The app is sleek and effortless to use, but my real peeve is with the auto-perspective when taking a photo. I use the app to scan notes for college, and often when I am taking photos of the notes, the app will automatically cut off half of a page or more, causing me to retake the photo over and over. Very frustrating. Otherwise, it's a great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"New folder creation not working in android 6.0 in my lg g3 please solve this issue"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gud work team I love this app..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately frequently freezes while scanning receipts on my Nexus 5X.  Synchronisation with Google Drive has to be regularly reset for it work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Solid concept but freezes sometimes and UI could be simpler...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Best app in my mobile"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Probably the best scanning app out there. It supports one-shot to multiple pages neatly, has cloud support and works smartly with style."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Blazing fast automatic high quality PDF scans. Has improved a lot since I first downloaded it. I haven't used it in a while but I'm glad I did not uninstall it. Scanning from your phone cannot be more effortless. Faster and easier to use than CamScanner (I used this app previously but changed my mind after today when I realized the great imrovements of Scanbot) Scanbot is like a bot-scanning assistant for free. The auto upload feature makes it even more convenient to use! Thank you!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing application, works as described. Love it. Very handy when you urgently need a digital copy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Like other ""scanner"" apps I tried, it does not scan but instead takes a picture. If I needed to take a picture I would've used the camera on my phone. Very deceptive and not original"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"One evening I was unhappy about carrying my notes and laptop. So I downloaded Scanbot and scanned all the notes and put it in my Google drive. Carrying light and I'm happy now!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Utterly despicable behaviour. I bought the pro version. Then they made the paid app free, and asked for an IAP to buy it again..... So I have to pay twice!?  After multiple emails, Scanbot offered to refund the initial payment, which, SHOCKER, is less than the current price for PRO. Why are they risking such a bad reputation for a few dollars.....   Update -  I switched to 'Pro w/ ads' Because I was missing my previously purchased features. It is Basically all the pro features for free if you tolerate ads. But, when I scanned a receipt, it started blasting a loud VIDEO AD. Imagine being at a business lunch and scanning the receipt, only to have a loud video ad blast from your speakers. How embarrassing.   The sad thing is, your app is actually very good, but this company doesn't understand or value its customers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a easy and great tool for ""on the go"" PDF scanning.  Very helpful scanning, emailing, sharing, or uploading to cloud storage."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Images look good and easy to use. It was a no brainer to throw a few bucks at the dev to go pro for all their hard work on this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"One of the best mobile scanners I have used."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"What a great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It can never find the document and cuts off in weird places. It could just be my phone though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it to do with no fuss! Thank you for an awesome scanner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Love"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"After trying dozen others, this Is The ONE!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot and seems very well put together,  bought the pro version,  only couple of niggles,  would be good to have an option to manually take the snap shot as sometime takes too quickly and the boarders aren't quite right,  and can't seem to get automatic up load to Google Drive so have to do manually but other than that it's great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Was one of my favorite apps but with 6.0 it completely broke. Folders cannot be created locally anymore and attaching files to a mail won't work neither. Very disappointing as the issue already exists couple of month."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"the most frustrating ui i have ever seen. I never understood where it saves the file. I select sd card option to save and it saves in some hidden system folder path.. finally uninstalled. I dont think i will ever go back to scanbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very convenient and easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Good but it's difficult to use and all the time asks you to become a Pro!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Before the update everything worked great; I got to scan a document and sent it to my business email with no issues. Now since the update it has not worked correctly. I can still scan but I can't send the document to my business email. I keep getting the message ""Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently"". Other than that, everything else still works normally as before the update."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Purchased the app but can't change the themes, says I have to be a 'pro' and upload can't be simultaneously uploaded to more than one cloud services?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Could use minor improvements, like retouching the docs after scan (they come out dark a lot), but this is exactly what I was looking for, and makes my life easier"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to take all the docs"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it is super easy to use, and very useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it autoscans+captures documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Totally awesome, ""must have"" for road warriors.  Easy to use, versatile and free!  Purchasing pro version just to support them, well done!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy for work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I was surprised to see what this ap can do. It's much better than just taking pictures of documents and receipts. I use it mostly to take pics of receipts for larger purchases in case there's a problem with the item and I might misplace the original receipt."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gave it only 4 stars because the camera sensor remains always  in use this leads to battery draining very fast on both Asus zenphone 2 and ipad mini 2. I love the auto capture.  Good work,  if you resolve the battery issue I will go for the pro version on both."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing App... works like a charm..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Can't rename docs after scanning anymore, please bring that back"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Better scan apps out there. This one doesn't clean up the scan to high contrast black font on white background. Camscanner much better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanner in the palm of your hand"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Tried, and uninstalled. Sorry, CamScanner still offers better scanning (processing) quality..."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this for all my scanning; receipts, recipes, all kinds of things. Love the auto upload feature."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"First off.  It's great, I love the app and want to support the devs.  The only issue I've been having is that my phone is overheating when I use it for more than 5 minutes.  It shutdowns my phone if I keep using it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Wasting time with Christmas offers that doesn't work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks  very  nice  application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This thing works mostly like a charm. So far the naming in the older versions wasn' t always the best."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use it for study, scanning written notes to upload. I take pix of receipts for future insurance claims. .soo easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Description made it sound like it scans to text. Doesn't seem to."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app recomended"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I love this app but I am not a good photographer. Try making a way for us to get a perfect picture.  Maybe  translucent moving bubbles with centering lines that will indicate that my phone is completely level above the document I am scanning? Like a carpenters level for example.  Also I would like to add text to a document in case I have to fill in some blanks. The annotations tool doesn't cut it. The annotations tool doesn't feel so professional. Thank you -Tyler"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best one till now"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Flash light stays on after taking photos. Also I did not manage to get back to already taken photos after manually disabling flash light.

Well I use it and it works perfect. Thanks as it has come to save a lot of time for some things I have needed. Keep up the good work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best scanner i have used till now."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Top-notch app. I had a problem recently with it due to a bad phone. I like that it has several price tiers, so you pay for what you need."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"App worked great on my old Samsung note 3. On Nexus 6P after scanning the buttons don't response to touch. It takes 7-8 tries to save the file after scan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app saves me hours weekly. I'm a frequent traveler and I have to submit expenses reports basically every week. Scanbot saves me countless hours of scanning and submitting. Works lovely with evernote too."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast, easy, intuitive and best of all, auto upload to cloud! Super"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"All other scanner apps I've tried are just awful compared to this. The whole process is quick and intuitive, no unnecessary clicks, uploads automatically to Google drive, no fuss."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Gives me error message, won't work after that"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Auto crop doesn't always work, though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cool cool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I don't like how it scans the page automatically even when it's not focused, and without checking the borders first, so I have to change it manually after taking the picture.  Also, I would like to be able to adjust the hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc. because some documents look awful with the preset filters, and there's nothing I can do about it.  The scans aren't bad, but I'll stick with apps with more manual settings, for now, so that I can get the look that I want."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app restarted my phone, ok Nexus 4 issue with android 4.3 and 4.4 but what about nexus 4 with android  5.1.1 . I wanted to buy that app until I faced the restart.I am sorry for that wish it would get better someday."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not what I thought"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Could you guys please add an organize feature where we can merge 2 PDF to one folder. Add this and you got 5 stars"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"When i scan with the G4 it freezes sometimes when processing the image"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Stuck on Syncing purchases"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanned doc is very clear. Thank you"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app hangs up on Xiaomi Mi4."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Fantastisch!! Ik like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"توپ"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It always crashes I had to download another app to get the work done."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"beautifully designed.... But stability has taken a huge hit"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's like magic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Since the last couple of updates the quality has in fact gone down. The resulting image/document has a LOT less quality than with previous versions,  which doesn't make sense at all but is sadly the plain truth. Don't know what they changed,  but please change it back!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Deceptive ads."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like the app but I'm not sure how to or if I can save the scanned document as word document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Very slow TEXT FAIRY is much better and faster"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Was a really good app, but with Android 6.0 the only thing I got from this APP is this message everytime I start the APP: Unfortunately, Scanbot has stopped. [Report | OK]  Please Fix it!  [1 Star]  Update: [Oct. 27/2015] I updated the app some days ago and the APP is no longer with the problem but I have to manually add the Camera permission to be able to use the APP. [5 Starns Now for excelent support and functionality]."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Crashes frequently on nexus 9 running on marshmallow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"""Importing multiple images from gallery to scanbot or sharing images to scanbot ""is missing .."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The ONLY app that will scan and create a searchable PDF! That's right. Plenty will scan to pdf, but not do the OCR. some apps will do OCR on a scan picture to the clipboard for pasting. Google drive USED TO do it but has definitely stopped. So you must but this until something better comes along..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works well!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's super easy to use and intuitive. The automatic edge cropping and uploading to Dropbox is awesome! The OCR on the pro version is totally worth it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"But it works. You need a more steady hand and a LOT more patience than I have. Had to scan items repeatedly because it kept zeroing in on headings and Kanji instead of the whole document full of writing. Can't find a way to turn that off."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The scanning is fast, the OCR is great, and it's quick and easy to send documents out wherever they need to go.  It's also nice looking and easy to navigate.  One feature I'd like to see is the ability to default the title of the document to title obtained from OCR."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The best free scanner but auto crop is getting annoying and stupid"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"To the developers   :-  The native camera app takes much better pics of texts and radiology films than scanbot camera. And second. .... once a pic is clicked, it has to be manually saved to local sd card or cloud before clicking the next one. It would be better if the pics are auto saved locally without intervention so that multiple pics can be taken quickly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, perfect for class. Would gladly pay a couple bucks for it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Useless.  You can just take a photo and it doesnt even save the images in a folder. Also always unable to create new folder."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Basic features are very useful. I upgraded to Pro but found the advanced features useless. It seems annotations can only be viewed from within the app, only by going into the edit screen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Simple and clean app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Looks good during the intro tutorials but then the app force closes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Lifesaver. Works flawlessly. Good work devs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"ocr langauge is forced to system ui language. there's no way to change it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. High quality scans without having to own a scanner!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Already paid to become a pro😁"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"So freakin laggy and stuttery while scanning multiple pages. My sony xperia has snapdragon 800 with 2gb ram."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This  scanner works  flawlessly and five stars are not enough."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent. I especially like the OCR capability. Well worth a 5-star rating."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"An excellent app which does what it claims. It could include a camera widget which can scan on single tap from home screen itself for super fast scanning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what you need it for. Good thinking with the auto-upload feature. Just one thing: when you're editing a photo the camera is kept active in the background and so is the flashlight. that's quite irritating when you adjust your doc and uses battery."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Solves all documents issues"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"increase image qquality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"When using the app there seems to be no control over the focus of the camera on the phone, therefore every scan is something of a blur party. I uninstalled this and was not a fan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"同期對比過 CamScanner, 兩款都不錯, 只是 CamScanner 可以免費分享, 而且優化拍出來的文件也比較好！"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A very recommended app!! No need to take too much time turning on the printer at home. Scan anything easily whenever and wherever! And it goes on pdf file too!! Thanks to whoever who created this!!!!! 😂"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Einwandfreies scannen, OCR, Anbindung an Dropbox und schickes, funktionales Interface - was will man mehr?!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Using it on a MotoX phone.  Easy to email or put up on cloud / dropbox.   Will consider Pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It will be more user friendly when I need to select multiple images from the device"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Confusing!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Update: SD card issue was lollipop's fault.   Fixed it with  some root app.   Software could improve recognition on light backgrounds.   I will never get over developer screwing over early backers who paid for app before it was ""free"".   Original review :  Developer decided to leave out to dry people like me who originally bought the app before it became ""free"".  No credit was given, or process was onerous and complex.   Also after upgrading to lollipop, scans never finish processing when saving on external"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just 💘 it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Promptly fixed dropbox bug"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It is useful to my academic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not easy to download, i cnt download it pls help"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"My phone reports Scanbot as Malware!!!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"جبد جدا"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent and easy to use app doing exactly what it says it does!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Saving all my receipts and documents and because of the auto upload to my Google Drive it makes it more easy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"What's going on guys? I love your app but since getting an AVG alert for Malware, I'm gonna have to remove it. Whatever you've done you need to undo before I return. Until then I'm uninstalling your app. Fix it please, I want to come back!!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"App works fine, but i'v got an warning from AVG that the app is classified as malwere.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"But saves the images after saving the document.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"the scanner works fine and the autoscan is brilliant.  I am marking it down and uninstalling it because it keeps rebooting my tablet.  my tablet is a Galaxy Note 8 running Galaxy 4.4.2"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Love the app. Looking to get premium but need to use it more and to see if its really eat a lot of battery. Please change the UI for better durability, i guess."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great so far! Love the way it scans!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"this app drain a lot battery &gt;20% even not using it by open camera!! spying?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just what i need"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good quality. Difficult to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"App"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good apps ever!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Hate it!!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I was able to take photos as large as 20mb and convert them in scanned documents. Better than cam scanner which does not supports file size more than 8 mb. Few draw backs in the software. 1. While cropping the done button is difficult to see as the screen and the done button both are white. First time users might dislike this and uninstall the software. 2. The file can only be saved in .pdf format not in .jpg. i am not sure if its available in paid version or not but please add this option too."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's so far so good. However, one missing feature I really need is for organizing scanned document. I am looking for the feature to automatically naming the file by using QR code or bar code. Unless I am wrong, I can't find that feature form your app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bakwas"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cool, it works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tried it, it didn't scan, uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Freezes after picture is scanned."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Like a charm..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This apps sketchy and asks for questionable permissions to your phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the definitely the best scanner app that I have used and I have used a lot of them ! The design is  great. The functionality and execution is smooth n effortless. Keep up the awesome work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing - I never use my scanner anymore"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Liked the auto-sync with Dropbox feature. I was using CamScanner before this but the Dropbox sync has me hooked. Scans are good quality, easy and UI is comfortable to use. Thumbs up so far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"By definition what does it mean? I installed this for receipts. Does that mean this app recognizes the total of a receipt? I have scanned two so far and it was ok but I didn't see any sort of ""text recognition"" there. I didn't see the total of a receipt, any merchant name and so on. Just the texts of the app of course.                 I.                                                            I did actually buy the PRO. It's the one time payment and it was 4 point something dollars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been a pro user for about a year and I love it, it keeps getting better and better and the quality and speed improve constantly as well.  The OCR can take a long time depending on the device, an optimized version for Intel x64 would be great but then again I'm being a little selfish maybe..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Comes in Helpful category...!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"auto upload no longer working and irritating panel to share imposed at the top of the scroll list of scans"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works brilliantly and easily, and it's regularly improved. Free is good, pro is better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good program with very easy to use interface. I like the fact that I can scan multi page pdf and easily upload it to onedrive or g drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to scan documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I tried a lot of pdf scanners, this was the best. The free version satisfied my every need, but I went pro anyways just to support their work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Unlike most other scanner apps for Android, this has real, automatic cropping in the viewer, before you take the photo. It will tweak contrast for documents and seamlessly send it off to your cloud services of choice. The pro pack includes OCR, and although I usually let Google Drive or Evernote handle that, it is still useful for creating easily shared PDFs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very functional and great design!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app for scanning documents. But bring your charger to the archive"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, efficient, aesthetically pleasing.. really nice work guys!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is great. It's probably the best app to make the tedious task of scanning several pages of a document and putting it together in a single PDF as fast as possible. It's capable of detecting the edges of your document so you won't have to worry about only framing it with your camera. TL;DR: IT'S GREAT, DOWNLOAD IT."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works very well"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scans well, uploads to cloud automatically, no fuss."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Freaking awesome, simple and beautiful. For once I feel like I bought an app worth it for more than just a few months, it keeps getting better and better."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Ocr means your capturing the words from a scan. Not making a picture and attaching it to pdf... The biggest difference is editing. Can't copy our pirate words in a picture."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Stupid ugly ui"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Google"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I will be able to scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I scanned 200 documents and over night it only processed and saved 2 of them. I bought the product too. Don't make my mistake. I wasted a good 45 minutes and my paperwork which is now in the mail is not scanned and saved."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Worth paying for. Very good for expenses"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Took the paid version. Didn't work ever! Always crashes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just installed. Think I will like..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great little app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I have the pro version. This is undoubtedly the BEST scan app. I had rated it 5 star earlier. But i find it has some glitches. Even after defining the cloud option every time it keeps on asking the cloud storage option - it is so annoying. It simply does not remember or save the option. I have defined the same google drive option at least 10 times"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use & organize documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its the best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Seriously! Just installed this to scan some collectible cards quickly, and really impressed! Scans amazingly well at a high quality, corrects distortions, automatically Uploads to any cloud service you'd like, and most importantly to any folder you'd like. You can also set it to save a single page document as an image, which is super helpful for me. And, this is all in the free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just as good as CamScanner but without an atrocious recurring payment."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"You might as well take a pic of your document. *edit after response*: I tried to scan several  documents on a table, app didn't detect it because of ""backround issues"". Although daylight was shining through I had to turn all the lights and lamps around so it would finally scan it. You're right, this app is not for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I downloaded and installed it twice on my Note 3, but each install only opened the first screen, then froze. I'd give it zero stars if possible!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very nice UX and app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"if sheet on light background, has difficulties to find page edges. High quality scans size a bit too big and lower quality scan  somewhat coarse. But extra points for conversion/correction speed and quality and Bluetooth sharing made possible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app !!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This is one of the better apps that I have used for scanning however, when the initial scan is taken the borders doesn't always accurately find the edge of the page which forces you to rescan multiple times even if you adjust the borders manually the edges are jagged and the PDF will not be a uniform size when printed. With that being said I do believe this app is one of the best available currently."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best place to keep receipts"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Pro let's you turn ON ads?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this app at work all day to scan documents.  Super easy and really high quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scanbot is one of my favourable apps, and always installed in my mobile devices."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"You should let us edit .... Dnt jst say that we need pro for anything... I m not happy ..let us edit and I will give u 6 stars...:)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Have tried a few scanners and this is the best so far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"FREE VERSION: Compared to MS Lens this is a far superior product. Only thing I could fault was the smart auto-crop needs some extra method to allow user to signal image boundaries prior to the snapshot being taken; not sure, but perhaps if the user touches some boundaries the logic accepts those as picture boundaries.  Premium is a tad expensive, but does have some valuable features which some might need.  Highly recommended!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Quite useful. However buggy across several phones and tablets. Often have to reboot to use camera again. Won't write to external SD cards (even though there's an option for this). Seems to crash often when pending uploads are queued, wiping out a lot of scans. Annoying."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Functional and smart, quickly scan multipage documents and OCR them in background. 5 stars when you add the ability to merge documents and add/remove pages to/from existing documents."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"You have to turn your document to see it correctly.  But scan great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just wanted to say thank you for an awesome app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app seems to work fine but all my scans tend to have a bluish tint.  At first i thought the problem was with my phone or lighting but even after changing both the bluish tint remains.. Would give 5 stars is this is solved."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's really Awesome!. Just add file upload progress. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not just a workaround to get data on your mobile device, a well polished functioning asset to Office Mobile 365."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Kudos!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very good!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Auto capture, auto cropping, OCR, lots of upload/sync options. Awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome app...  Very helpful and easy to use...   Thanks a lot..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Please add business card scanning"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Keeps giving error 963"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I was having problems with the scanning feature of Evernote on my android phone. So on a recommendation I went to scanbot and it is working excellently."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"But sometimes at night it doesn't work normally although the light is enough."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent user friendly"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Terrible image processing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great! Use it daily"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Hure hip hip I got this"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Did your ocr in paid version support thai??"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the closest app I've found to matching scanable on my iPhone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Smart document detection, fast and usable. Recommend!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So easy to use makes sending a file a snap!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The App keeps Force closing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's awesome and easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use this almost everyday. Not sure why others might be having problems. It does a great job. I even scan architecture plans to my computer with this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just a really reliable great scanner. Exactly what I need."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"really a nice app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm going paperless and this is the solution!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Earlier i used to love it. But from past few updates all the pages that i scan turn out to be tooo dark if viewed in colour version and too bright if viewed in B/W version. This is the reason i had to make a shift to Microsoft lens app. I am using Zenfone 2"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I want to buy it but it shows error during the purchasing procedure"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Can't combine various scanned documents as one fine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I don't understand where all the great reviews come from.  This app is horrible.  See what the person does at :12 in the video?  I want THAT app. This one doesn't even come close.  When I try to scan, it either does nothing or messages flash on the screen that alternate between ""No Document"", ""Hold Still"", or ""Move Closer"".  It hasn't taken a single shot automatically like it shows in the video.  I fiddled with this app for over 2 hours and finally gave up.  When you put out an app that behaves like the one in the video, let me know!  $5 down the drain."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Even after 3 updates, it still force closes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Me gusta mucho más que CamScanner que es el más usado. El interfaz es perfecto."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The scan quality is great, the user interface is excellent, best I've found"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like the app but need to be able so send though text message not just email"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This app doesn't do anything new that my smart phone cant do already??  it's just a camera app in its free form?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"UPDATE - - - Not sure if it's new or was there all along, but I found the option to rename documents. Now this app is perfect for my needs.                      ORIGINAL REVIEW - - - App works great for scanning documents. I only wish there was a way to rename documents in the app before uploading."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it! Easiest way to get great quality scans into Google Drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app has all the required features and works well. The interface is also well designed to stay out of the way. I faced a bug in a previous version where the app would keep showing loading after taking a pic, but it was promptly fixed soon after I reported it. Great app and equally good support by the developers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It has both a subscription and a one-time only purchase option. And I  find it very affordable. Well done!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It once was a great app. Now it struck at loading screen after taking scan. Please fix this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best scanner application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really convenient and great quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very handy scanning App and stable"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks for a great improvement.  Medium quality seems just right for my needs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It takes to long to get one scan. I was cutting off the page"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great piece of work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app, great support."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Only one app from all available on the market that does not automatically change your images after scan. It also has nice swipe, auto-recognize, auto-take-picure… swipe-again procedure that makes scanning long documents much faster."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"An app that I use vert often. Very  convenient."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"My clients think I have a scanner at the office. Haha."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Clean UI with powerful tools"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's a great app, however, it shuts down and restarts my tablet every time I try to close any menu or leave the app,this needs fixing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After the recent update the app is force closing itself I can't use it the app just shuts down I loved this app please fix it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Seems every time I go to use it I can't find it and have to install again."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is cool because it practically fixes any image by itself. Indeed, such images are better than the scanner's."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent app to scan documents using your smartphone. I love it so much."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Right what I was looking for.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"There are many ways to ""scan "" the docs, this app looks like the easiest one! Amazing results in a moment."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It took a little while, but they finally implemented scan quality setting adjustments, which was the one thing that had prevented me from buying the app. Now, with the promise of sustainable use in hand, I'm off to the checkout. Thanks, guys!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm amazed at how well this works."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It readily identifies the doc and scans. Really great!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Feature is not many, but create great result."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Superb..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Would be a benefit to share the scans via Whatsapp though"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is pretty good at getting the files."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exactly what i needed. Worked flawlessly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is lifesaver"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Scan looks exactly like a pic. Scanner takes random pics without warning."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Deleted my VERY IMPORTANT scan before uploading  it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app makes life much easier..👍👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful and easy to use. Good UI"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scanbot has all I need for day to day use.  But very frustrating on docs that are not pages.  E.g. Scanning a column in a newspaper."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app , easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is such a good scanner.  I tried so many scanners before but non can be compared to this one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love on first sight"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Needed to send clear copy of living will to my sis b4 surgery, our copier/scanner gave out and I was desperate! Read a lot of reviews and the ones for Scanbot were consistent, not all over the board. Needless to say my sister was able to read every side scribble I made on the form! Thanks Scanbot for that!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"App worked when used it.  But starts and restarts frequently according to clean master.  Consequently draining battery,  this started after a Vzw update to the phone."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple.  Easy to use.  Works great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is an exception! I really love it and the filters don't interrupt with any thing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple n easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Unable to scan newspaper column with auto detect, very blurry and unreadable. Fortunately, one reviewer mentioned swiping down the screen. Also would be nice to have a tutorial rather than force user to discover other options via trial and error."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I switched from CamScanner, and this app is way easier to use. The auto capture is a bit inaccurate, and sometimes the upload to cloud feature is pretty slow despite having good signal."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Much better than taking pictures"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its good but it only scans in black and white not colors"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Doing tasks like converting receipts to an electronic form will go quickly rather than be a chore."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome scan app and better automatic save than press Save"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"As for an office lens user I could no like this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"How do you make an app where it's not obvious how to save the file you've just been scanning? Not to mention that it should do it automatically."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent. Easy to use, effective and well worth the money."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great! Hoping for future support towards Copy and other similar services for uploading."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"best  app ever,  user interface is excellent, scanner quality very good not to mention the price is very affordable.                                                  I don't have any complain at all yet, good job creators. ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm.Thanks for this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for scanning receipts or even photographs"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, a pro bot :p"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app, very good quality. I had no issues with it at all.. There's no reason for me not to give it 5 stars!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"As a scanner it is a good one with nice auto outlining of the document and cloud upload, OCR is good for simple pages, however, it does not work when you scan for example a page from an article with two columns and an abstract, needs improvement"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It just works is literally the best description I can use for this app. I hover it over some paper, or a card, and it automatically gets it scanned. Better yet, it also detects QR codes too, so I don't have to have a separate app for it! Beautiful too. The pricing model is also one of the fairest I've seen in an app. Literally no complaints. Love this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Useful this day and age"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It does a decent job detecting document edges."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"No whatapp share"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is just i want it .. ! Quality is superb.. !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This works wonderful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works great as a quick and simple scan recorder.  One request I have found so far is the ability to add some handwritten text to a scan rather then just a signature.  This would be good to for example make a quick note on a receipt before upload.  Please consider!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is fabulous, Google drive integration works flawlessly.  I wish Google would buy it and replace their built-in scanner in google drive with this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing UX,Beautiful UI"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"So far I'm enjoying this app.  It works with a ton of 3rd party services, such as Box, so my scans automatically upload and automatically OCR while charging overnight (to conserve battery).    Great app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I can't get the ocr features to work and the scam basically looks like a pic.  CamScanner has more settings that make scans look like copies vs a picture."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been trying so many different ones and this is by far the quickest and easiest to use. Will probably buy just for the OCR feature. Keep up the great work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tried to have Scanbot upload a 200+ page document. BIg upload of course. Took hours to scan. Upon hitting upload, Scanbot deleted the document from phone and failed to upload. In one day it cost me about as much productivity as it earned over six months. I won't be using it for anything larger than 10 pages again, but honestly, probably will never use it again because I'm too bitter about it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Korean language(hangul) not recognized."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Super but can't able selectAll pics from gallery"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Waste of time.  Need something fast and reliable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Auto capture is fantastic, lots of options and great quality."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When picture of document is taken, screen just keeps on loading continuously."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"custom contrast and brightness, camera gridlines and share image to gallery."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I've been through a few scanner apps and this is by far my favourite. Very intelligent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ho testato anche altre ma questa il migliore aspettiamo il tuo nuovo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really useful app, great for all my bills"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not many apps get a five star rating from me.  I give 5 stars to only few best apps.  This is one of them.  Simple, easy ,fast ,,excellent at work. What more do u want"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Grrrrreat"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nothing to compare"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is a rare case of a perfect app. Simple, powerful, reliable... One of my favourite Android apps."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"its work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I cannot use this app at all... Tried it many times but after it took a picture, my screen stuck there... Really disappointed..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful program"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"While on business trips, I simply scan receipt as soon as I receive them, and they're automatically uploaded to my DropBox ""Receipts"" folder.  Then I can easily view them from my PC via dropbox as PDF's. Super easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I love the way the documents look but when I try to save them the wheel just keeps spinning. I need to send documents to my lawyer and they just won't save. #Frustrated"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's amazing (merci pour l'application)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Galaxy Note 3 - Says package file not signed correctly!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Scanning works fine, but OCR has some limitation. It only works for PDF files, not for image. For PDF, the files are too big for saving. And I can't find language setting on Android. I would like to select Traditional Chinese. Currently when I copy text, it only works in English."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"All this app does is take pictures and string them together. It DOES NOT scan. The app also force quit when I was almost done with my project and I had to start over. The picture quality is also horrible."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Loved the app when first installed but for the past week I keep getting ""Unfortunately Scanbot has stopped"" every time I try to use. I think there has been a fatal crash."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"very easy to use....."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic on the fly scan from the first try."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"When I make a scan it say""No document"""
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After wasting a lot of time with other apps (I always buy apps worthwhile, or upgrade), this app seemed like a godsend but would not upload to Dropbox or Evernote. My seven small scans ended up nowhere. What could have been a great app ended up falling flat. And sadly. If ""document processing""  indefinitely means anything to you then this should be your choice. Otherwise look elsewhere. Seems like a ton of work went into something that just doesn't compete in the slightest."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'll give it an easy 5 star. However, I hope they add more image processing algorithms that other scanner apps have."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really love this app. Might as well go Pro."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent! ✨"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"PDF files"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Auto Border recognition is great. Simple PDF creation and sharing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use it alot for reimbursements!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Only blank screen seen every time"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Never was able to capture document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best out there"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Need more speed when processing, ""cam scanner"" can generate higher quality images and no need long process, but the design is nice and the icon is cute but classy!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Odlična aplikacija za sve kojima je potrebna fotografija dokumenta/računa bez potrebe za dodatnim sječenjem slike."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Two stars only for idea.........."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just installed and tested app now, great app, great quality, app very user friendly and have alot of functionality, very Robust."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"S.O.S please, i cant download using my internet data. It keep loading and loading until now..:-(..it not about mu internet data..other app. Seem working great..why?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of how if there is a URL in a qr code it loads that link in an in app browser rather than just listing the info. Would rather it list the info and let me choose to view it. The IAB even has a redundant button at the bottom to view in a browser. At least make it a toggle option in the settings.  There are a lot of fake reviews too. Really obvious."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best ever. I read all the comments others posted. was some discouraged. however thought I can always uninstall it. Works great love it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Looks good if I can use it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app reduces clutter!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Must try"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Auto scan can take time to adjust..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It was working great at first but now... my last couple of scan are ""queued""indefinitely for some reason, leaving it useless at the moment...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Thought it would be something i would find a use for occasionally but i couldn't get it to run"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Everything a scan app should have. Easy to use. Amazing interface. Super quick. With tons of cloud connections. I tried a few others before, but this one is by far the best."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not work on droid turbo"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I can not think of one negative thing to say.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Needs more availability to what you can scan, won't work on papers, gift cards, and and type of credit card"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Gets the work done"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"How to focus is by clicking on object with touch screen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"DOPE"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app !"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Slow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I really like the idea, but blurry images, that look like they either aren't at full camera resolution or out of focus, make this app irrelevant."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"No more standing over a document trying to get it to focus and retaking the picture multiple times to get one readable scan.  This app is awesome on my Galaxy s5, works perfectly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Works perfectly but really needs some way of easily sorting captured docs into use defined categorys/directories. For example, on saving being able to select business-recpt, personal-recpt, misc-note, todo, etc and have the pdf go into that named directory."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I paid for this app, but now there is an in-app purchase for ""pro"", and I have to pay for it! I should get those features for being an early adopter."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Blurry & not good focus. Can't read what's scanned.  If these were corrected I could give it a better rating."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Most well spent 10 mins of my life to scan my paperwork then find they don't exist anywhere.  Best app ever"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"future is coming"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"First scan worked great. Subsequent scans did not."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Trap"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it says on the tin, works smoothly, even on my older (2012) phone. Strongly recommend!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I loved this app. But somehow, it has stopped functioning on my handset. It hangs after clicking the pic."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So accurate and clear scans it's scary. 10000 🌟 🌟"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if a custom list of auto upload destinations and shares could be set. As well as a default editing of scans. Integration with OneNote would make it complete!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Tried to update and tablet kept crashing. Uninstalled and now when I try to download  Play Store crashes. Besides this issue this is a fabulous app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Will not work properly on my phone. When I try to scan something, the screen just freezes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Easy to use interface.  Scans are quick and clear.  Uploads to your cloud storage provider.  I would happily pay for the free version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Documents never got any farther than processing. Program repeatedly stopped."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scan every document I want."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Thought I could replace a scanner I purchased for receipts, etc. to have less to carry. It works better than others I have tried,  but not as I would like. It won't scan unless the background color was very different which you can't always do. A lot of the text could be read,  but was blurred. Handwriting was almost impossible. Tried making a 5 pg document into a single pdf, but after 25 minutes it was still processing even though wifi was fine, so I gave up. Will keep for now, but will keep looking."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"loved it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good tool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Really good one..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy and useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"It scans fine. I purchased it for OCR capability but it only uploads to Evernote in PDF. Can't get to or save the file as text."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've always relied on a dedicated OCR document scanner but Scanbot is amazingly good with converting scans to searchable documents. Now I don't have to always rely on my scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple, great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fun"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Application is all I needed to go pro. Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The app warms my phone very faster. The app also stops a lot of times"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Helpful app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very fast and easy and also an extreme image quality which makes all the difference from others."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Blurry images aren't that useful, although I like the automatic edgedetection. Instead of flipping this thing really could autoflip on it's own. detect the flip or at least do it every 3-4-5 seconds depending on how quick I think I am that day. Almost a nice program that wasted half of my day. But at least it has whistles as """"cloud upload"". Who on earth has the time to color  adjust every image separately ? Think about a 100 page book you might wanna scan. Worst thing is alternatives are as useless as this. I ended up taking pics at an interval and post processing on pc using scan tailor. This is useless."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Purchased Scanbot pro license early on, but when they switch over to in-app purchase, they removed the pro and does not honor their initialb offering. Requiring early adopters to pay monthly fee instead. Even now in their feature list they listed following.  -Upgrading to Scanbot Pro requires a one-time purchase price. Future pro features will be activated automatically.  Stay away from shady merchant who goes after your pocket and doesn't care about product quality or reputation."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply Brilliant. Just make sure you have a contrasting background so the scanner can pick out your page, and it will work a treat. Auto upload to Evernote works flawlessly. Paid for the premium version to support the developer. Great app. Only request would be a default setting for the flash to brighten pages rather than having to turn it on myself."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cloudy day (low light), angle shot for cropping. Cloud storage integration. Impressed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Same as Cam Scanner except cloud storage is available here.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is an app I use a lot. Easy as taking a picture and no more need for trying to email large images."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Using it for a little while, but seems great compared to similar apps - free version has no watermark, no ads, convenient UI. Does pretty good job with scanning and combining docs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app helps me keep track of documents and pics."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I've tried on two separate occasions to save multi page scans as a single document. It just seems to be stuck on ""processing"". Not really sure what to do but I can't wait forever. Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Probably the best scanning app on play store hands down."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I find this app really useful for a quick scan."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"WHAT A APP!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Has replaced my desktop scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"T O Neill"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Searching for weeks finally settled on this one to scan automatically into evernote ..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Could be better if you could add to an already saved pdf, like tinyscan does. Otherwise very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it to and more!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I use it regularly to scan my stuff & upload scans to Evernote!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Must app for all"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This one is killing its competitor CamScanner in major way. I really scan like 2 documents a year, so I do not need premium but since this app can replace regular scanner in office I recommend going for a premium just to keep devs motivated to keep the app amazing!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It is not able to scan anymore..just it takes the picture and then its loading and loading.. Plz help..    Was once my favorite app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Just add ""selecting multiple images""  while accessing photos from storage"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it doesn't capture the whole document, especially when the document contains tables, it tends to frame the table and ignore everything else. anyway I can manually set the borders."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Einmal bezahlt, und jetzt soll ich wieder zahlen? Nein danke."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb app. Better then cam scanner... Keep it up guys and add more freatures of editing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Don't identify any document"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Just add ""multiple photos selecting feature"".. (while taking images from phone memory) then I'll  give 5 stars :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Freezes immediately on Samsung Galaxy S4. Technical support took request, but has never replied"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I paid for this app about a year ago, but now it is free I don't even get any premium feature"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Iv actually relied on omlyvtwo other scanning apps and both were unreliable and sketchy at their ability to scan so cleanly and efficiently. Cam scanner and google drive Scan. I am deeply impressed how quickly and just how perfectly this gets the job done. Definitely I feel this is a true smart app that isn't slowed or buggy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Only one thing missing: can the developers include the ability to file scans into folders please?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great interface and the app auto detects and crops documents while allowing automatic upload to a number of cloud services. Fantastic app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for scanning plus brilliant to save to Dropbox.  Next it needs a search facility."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It is great for making pdf files"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I've just installed it and tried to scan a small receipt from the shop. The file was 1MB!!!! What is the point? If I want to quickly send something from a phone I don't need such quality. By the way... I've scanned the same receipt on a flatbed scanner at home, the file was 80kb. There should be a quality choice in settings somewhere. Apart from that I like it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"After loading the app, I'm in the ""Scan A Document"" screen, if I hit menu button the app force crashes. What happens if I need settings or want to view a previous scan? Broken. Please fix!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Really great for keeping and organising receipts for warranties on purchases. Would love the ability to create folders inside the Scanbot folder in my cloud storage and sort receipts by type (one for purchases for my car, one for purchases for my computer, one for purchases for household items etc.) This would be very convenient. Also being able to save multiple pages/receipts to one file would be a good feature. If these features get added then my rating of the app will raise to 5 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I tried to like this . The autocapture camera is great. But I was never able to figure out how to make a multicapture document. It only allowed me to make individual documents.  So I had to take 8 pictures of a document and send it as 8 separate PDF's. I emailed for support on 2 separate occasions and received no response.  I now use SD Scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Love the app and bought the pro version. Only thing is sometimes it force closes when I'm doing text recognition on some documents. LG G3 LS990"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Better than others. Use and feel the difference."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"No comparison!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Maybe it is just not compatible with my cheap android device.  Does anybody know of a scanner that works?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The tool itself is OK but they have yet to respond to my support questions (one is over two weeks old, the second is about three days).  I was considering the paid tool for use in my office but without any hope of support, I can't proceed further with this firm."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It's really a great app but recently the app won't even open. It's just black then it crashes. Please fix."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The app wouldn't even open on my One Plus One. Keeps closing. Waste of money for the Pro version."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"After update this app crash, It's not open just blink and close... I don't have any problem with this app before update... Thank you... Note 2 Lte"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to set up and use. Good job!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Scans well and I've been able to store in Google Drive but cannot download/import the images to my device or attach them to emails. Is that just me or is this feature lacking? Also (and worse): often causes my phone to freeze up so I have to reboot. Will keep it if this can be addressed otherwise will have to uninstall. (Galaxy S2)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love using it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It was the best ever scan app I used until I upgraded from MIUI V5 to MIUI v6 (custom ROM). Now it freezes the second it takes the picture. Every time I focus on a document and press the button, it freezes. Devs, please fix this ASAP. Missing ScanBot a LOT.. A LOT."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've used a bunch of document scanner apps mostly for keeping record of my expense receipts. This is the best I have used. Simple to used, very accurate, and the backup feature just works.  Highly recommended."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to save all the papers. Easy to upload to dropbox. Easy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's great for school, work and notes!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app!  Very useful!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This app is solid; it's got good border detection and scans well. Only issue is that the resulting file sizes can be nice as large as what you get with either scanning apps."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for meetings and organising my endless pieces of paper."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"best mobile scanner.. simple, fast, and easy.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Worked fine BEFORE I upgraded... great design but at present unusable =("
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"A lot advertising"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use& it works"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very nice scanner app, this app will even scan the document for you automatically, Amazing!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app doesn't take images in full resolution. Pictures still lacks clarity. Even the Camera app is taking better pictures than this. Also after taking the pictures and saving them I can't edit the filters applied later on. Please fix this. And should say that great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works accurately and quickly ensuref that I've got a findable image to protect.my leaky memory."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very helpful for mass processing of documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really worth having. Very useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"makes scanning documents so much easier that setting up my printer! brilliant!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It has fancy connection features but the text recognition is crappy and you can't try it out unless you buy the full version.  I took a chance and now I'm out 5 dollars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app saves me time & helps me keep things organised, acessible anytime and is great for piece of mind 😊"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It takes much of the guess work out with its on-screen instructions, and then gives good options for enhancing the final result."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"But submitted a ticket to the developer and the issue was resolved within 1 day, will go 5 stars after a little use and familiarity with no problems."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Being a student, I often have to take snaps of notes. And this app not only take pictures in PDF but also merge them together in a single file ! Must have for all students"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Beautiful app that performs brilliantly, but the only feature I miss from other similar apps, is the ability to add a new scan to an existing document. Or at the very least, the ability to combine multiple documents into one."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scanner app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love the design and all the little features,  only suggestion is to be able to create ""folders"" so it could be file cabinet like. This would be greatly liked on my end !!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good cloud integration and ability to save uploaded as image is nice."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Final stop for all mobile scanning solutions"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been using the free version of Scanbot, which in itself is awesome for the account of features it has. The pro variant offers so much more. Having the ability to sync all scans automatically to your cloud storage of choice is great. I like the interface, and am now liking the themes as well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Worked with Hebrew, would be 10 star app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love an app that does as it should. This app is quite painless to use and the final product(s) is/are superb."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Need to be more material designed.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I use it to scan my receipts and upload it to my owncloud server through webdav. Really easy to use and configure."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome!! Very easy to scan documents. In my experience it's much better than most all-in-one printers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"It sometimes save very long like 1 day and it cut out when I scanner it is not good update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is kind of everything you'd ever want from a phone scanner. I was looking forward to Evernote's Scannable app and stumbled on this. Beats the competitors by far... I don't know if I'll switch to Scannable when it comes out on Android because this is pretty great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Works pretty well. I'd like a trial for the premium before shelling out that much money.  The OCR has to be pretty good to make it worth it.  But it's nice to have the ability to scan to PDF without having to convert an image file to PDF."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best document scanning app in my opinion. It may not have all the fancy features the other apps have (although you can get them in the premium paid version), but it has everything I need for scanning receipts. Document detection is spot on; all required buttons are on the same screen. It also syncs to popular cloud services which is a great bonus. I also like the fact that its developers are adding features all the time. Simply the best for what I need it for."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Just kidding, but it is rly bad. It makes pictures, worse than the ones we started with. It just compresses and reduces the resolution of the image."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I scan just about everything now (receipts, insurance cards, etc). But the one thing I'd love to see is, the ability to see these scanned documents on another device within the app. I sync with Dropbox & I understand I can view them from DB but Scanbot is great for searching that OCR text! Please think about adding this in the future!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not work on samsung tab4"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Uninstall."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice application handy to have around"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow! is my initial impression. Far superior to the other three scanner apps I've used. Scanbot's UI is elegant and almost effortless. Instead of making you find the document corners, the app automatically frames what you're shooting, then gives you choices for optimum reproduction. The only negative is it seems to take lots of code to make this app work so well, but if you have room on your phone, it's worth it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I don't really like to give reviews, but this was the only scanner app in the play store that actually worked....This app saved me money and time. I have a Galaxy Note 4!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scanning app. Super easy to use"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Switched to Android and very glad they have it here. Amazing app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Got Pro Version Extremely happy about having it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"When tried to OCR the scanned document, app crashes. Is this Note 4 spesific or Android 4.4.4 spesific?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I tried several scanning apps,  and this is the one that gets the job done better and faster than all."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"THE BEST"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Yep, this app rocks, blows all the other doc scanner apps out of the water. Super user friendly, quick, smooth & completely Effortless. I'm amazed. While lounging on the couch, I tossed a receipt on floor, started Scanbot, tapped the flash button (the room was dark). With 1 hand, I dangled the phone over the receipt to scan it. Perfect image, PERFECT auto-crop! I'm buying the app after only 1 test scan & uninstalling the other crap scan apps!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amen!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app does exactly what our is supposed to do and more. The crops are near perfect and the auto-upload is useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple, fast and easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"See what it's like in the next few days."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is in need of a serious update. Just before I selected scan in camera mode, if I moved my device in any direction, it took a picture. In fact it took pictures of anything and everything. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, not a particularly stable device in many cases, but this is ridiculous, uninstalled."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I especially love the weird but uncannily savvy crop feature"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"it is smart and useful. please add ""business card scanner"" if possible or make it. I checked all card reader apps but no one of are smart and useful option like this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Real kewl"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Liked it but couldn't find how to reduce the size of the doc - eg vga - like in camscanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"And yes I am in pro"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Magnifico"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Editing is buggy now--every time I try to save after cropping it would just crash my tablet and restart. Until this is fixed, I'm knocking a star off my previous rating. My tab is a Galaxy Note 8.0, by the way."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can not  to compelet                    download  samsung  light"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Not as expected"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scans everything with ease. Even in the dark it worked for me!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I want to use it for a while before saying anything. I will continue to watch the application process."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Woow"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not bad, could come in handy for keeping a record of your receipts, but one thing I really find it's missing, is a category feature. Basically you scan 200 different things and they all end up mixed up in your phone. That's really silly. And there is no way to swipe through your scans either, like you would do with photos. You have to click each item one by one. Come on!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Have used many scanner apps. This is awesome."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good but sometimes says ""still processing"" for a long time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So good."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I am impressed with the way this app automagically captures a document. Best of all, it's free."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The perfect app for scanning n simple to attach files..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The only thing you'll need is to find a reliable light to eliminate the shadow on your documents"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use. Very fast to scan a big number of documents. Pleasant UK."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Deleted it...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Wasn't even using it and it used 4gb of data in 5 days.  No idea why or how.  Plus the application is useless.  Creates mega files you can't split or change once saved.  No better than just taking a photo in my opinion"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Doest what it says too well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app does what it says and it's scan quality is awesome."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"remember to set the 'save to sdcard' in the settings so you can see the pdf's  in your file browser etc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not work. Freezes while processing. I need an app like this that works, this one doesn't.  Also you cant give a name to a scan when it does happen  to work  without going to files and finding  it and renaming it there. The free version of this app worked, the upgrade doesn't.  I am very disappointed. Save your money and keep looking. (Galaxy Note 3)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It is almost like the scanner I never have. So easy to use and upload quickly. Able to copy and send it by email just using my samsung note 3."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best app,  works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Says 'no document' no matter what I point it at, and doesn't even focus properly when trying to take the picture..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Get a pop up multiple times daily on my S5 saying that the app has stopped, and would I like to report the bug. I never even ran it, so it shouldn't even be running!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Pretty sweet little app. I have a problem with losing receipts so this is great. Could you please make it possible to select what folder you want to upload to after the picture is taken instead of designating only one else folder?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A wonderful application for scanning. Easy saving as one of more pages pdf, uploading to a bit choice of clouds. Thank you!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the first time i am using this app it worked great in the beginning but now it wont scan my document and says 'ni document ' or 'use clean background'..... What should im do??? I really like this app so help me?!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Even after restarting phone it is supposed to be still processing a document. Days later. Hasn't managed to scan a document. Wrote to devs but they don't reply. Better not bother to install."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"AAP Naic"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's simple & slick and the cloud sync is great. Unfortunately, a very simple folder system to pre-order docs (receipts, quarantine docs, nots & scribbles... or just to separate work and private) right away is missing badly. I will do such organisation in the app while scanning the docs, but never in a second separate step in the cloud some other time. Any estimates if and when this will be implemented?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"very easy but if you want good quality this is not your answer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I mean i really  liked the  idea..  But it's  not working..  Says file create  error..  N does  nothing.. Please suggest  fix"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"good quality app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing in automatically detecting edges!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Err msg was about a failure to dismount memory card."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Top 10"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Could not see any images, no idea what was supposed to happen. Certainly didn't scan anything. Support site has an invalid certificate, so I thought it safer to uninstall."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Handy and great app but can't create folder"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Right off the bat, it didn't do anything it said it would do. It took a pic, I could've done that with cam. Didn't find edges, didn't even take a good pic. 1 star."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This seems to be the app I've been looking for. For such a long time and so many apps which never seemed to deliver as promised. This app, Scanbot,  does it with ease and accuracy. All my paper receipts auto uploads to my Evernote to the right folder. I am so happy with it!!!  5 stars absolutely."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"is there a way to turn off the shutter sound? didnt find how in the settings"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ideal for scanning documents on the road and Wi-Fi permitting, having them ready to use already uploaded to our cloud when back in the office. So far, no adverts and I hope it stays this way."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"just what i was looking for"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"But quality of scan is not good unless we have very clean background."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I have been looking for to make my home and work life easier. Before I discovered Scanbot my camera was over worked and spent half my time moving documents from my gallery to files. So much easier. Thank you Drippler for the introduction."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Never recognized documents, when it scans its blurry, has to take multiple pics for clarity"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's so simple and very handy. Easy to scan any documents. Automatic scan. Best ever scanning app. Thumbs-up and keep updating with new features."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"won't even start..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just checked it out... perfect for the job with great quality. Going for the paid pro version. Keep up the great stuff."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I am uninstalling this. shuts down my tablet every time I finish cropping image. I will stay with my current scanner.  Guess there is still some bugs. I have a Samsung note 10.1"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing at keeping receipts and stuff saved! I just saw this app on Drippler and thought it's about time I left a small review!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Way more useful than the pocket full of paper."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Like it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have been using paid version of tiny scanner and camscan but today i got this with all the options with best quality..this is not only good app ..it is the Best app .."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Seamless flow but a little buggy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easily replaces a conventional scanner for small needs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Working very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Tried every time in every way but failed to get a single scan. After clicking, it's always circling progress bar, I would say CamScanner is way to easy. I am using Xiaomi Mi3, might be a device specific problem but still. :/"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Coolest app ever. Keep up scanbot team"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I really loved it its a best app for scan doc."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Cam scaner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A great app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"A great app which comes in handy for students too.u know what I mean."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really loved it.. Awesome app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I loaded about 20 receipts from my wallet, went looking for another couple after I tore up all the paper, came back to the app and all my shots were gone"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"First few minutes of use and immediately upgraded to pro!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Stylish,  works extremely well and easy to upload scans.  Very fast scanning with great resolution!  I have used others but this really is top notch."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Does not work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"BEST SCANNING APP EVER :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I need to scan documents frequently, and this is by far the most full-featured and reliable app for doing so."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thus far this has become my daily driver. There are some minor issues that I would like to address on another occasion, but otherwise the developers seems to listen customers and improve their app all the time, without ridiculous per app payments. I'm happy to support these guys and their markets best scanner app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ก็ใช้ได้ดีทีเดียว แต่สัญลักษณ์งงไปหน่อย"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"but2 problem is it can not take picture on my phone mi4 miui v6"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is definitely a must have app for anyone who likes to keep digital records of receipts and such. It's got a beautiful user interface and works great. Highly recommended."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin. Makes me look like a super PA ;-)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I don't know of any better way to save important items of documentation than scanbot, it has been a real life saver."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great references"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been using it almost daily for a couple of months. It's simple to use, has quick auto-scan, and takes high quality images."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Thanks"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good idea specially the auto document finder and snapper. But missing two main features! One side basic file/category tagging. Second not possible to add pages to an existing document later."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but can you add zoom option in the next update"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good and useful... but after 5page it stop working... hope a better update next time..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Great and intuitive to use! but scans blur image all the time! NOT A SINGLE DOCUMENT scanned till now is clearly visible!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I have to pay to have OCR?. That was the interesting feature of this app. I can use my camera built-in app to take pictures of texts and images and save or send them... Really?."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Produces high quality scans that are easy to edit, save and share-  OnePlus One, Mahdi ROM 4.4.4. PROTIP: If your device has a crappy camera on it, it is not necessarily the fault of scanner/cam apps that your images come out crappy as well. You're not going to try to create a masterpiece using crayons you bought from the dollar store so why would you think that your 3mp budget smartphone camera is going to produce HD ultra sharp scans?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"This app is not free only limited things you can do"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Scans quite well in my experience. Even better than my good camera"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I have some issues with lost files but overall I like the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Si far, app seems promising, but I have found some inconsistency with subscription model. In app it says $0.63 and Google play wants to charge me $1.08"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its very easy to scan and use..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I can't update the app it shows error like can't move to usb storage are sd card"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"This application can only scan 1-5 pages. More than that always restart my phone and did not save the information I scanned. I wish it works as it supposed to be."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Incredibly useful scanner app. Has worked perfectly from day one. Quick and always reliable. A+"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I like the concept, but it doesn't scan correctly."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wicked fast tech support, improvements.. and it's a very usefull tool.. a must have!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Makes uploading graded rubrics much easier."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easily the best scanner on the play store. Does have some issues with my Nexus 5 though, camera is really dark. Other than that, exceptionally good!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"its better then scanning m/c. love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Comparing to other app in market this app is nice and clean."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great, love it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"PDF scanner and qr reader in one app doesn't exactly sound practical on face value, but is insanely convenient."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"There is currently no easy way to find out where exactly the files are stored on the device. I eventually found the folder using ES File Explorer, but this could've been avoided if the developer(s) working on this app would have implemented this in the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I like how it lets you link right away to a variety of cloud databases. The photo quality needs improvement though."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This works so easily and I can save to any of my cloud drives immediately or by wifi. Good clear images"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"My first review was very critical as the app crashed a lot. Not so anymore. Picture quality and filters are not quite as good as some of the competitors but otherwise functionality is great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Very bad picture quality. In my camera app the quality is much better. Pity. Unusable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Automatically finds the document. Let's you adjust for keystone. High quality PDF. No way to save to SD card, so not much use in public areas or while traveling. Pro features not available through Play, must use credit card or PayPal and pay added fee above quoted price, which is too high to start with."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The app has an intuitive interface and connection with major storage services. Took nothing to learn how to use it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love this app!  This app makes scanning quick and simple. It has enough features without being complicated, and the cloud scanning feature is perfect for automatically uploading scans to Evernote. This is a must-have."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"A great concept but upon opening the scanner to scan I get a black Screen and am incapable of scanning anything."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Easy to use .auto upload to cloud. Does hang sometimes."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Well designed, well implemented app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Amazing App. Thank U VERy much :-)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Brilliant!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app to use everyday or keep in your back pocket."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it! Works great."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Sometimes has trouble identifying the documents so have to manually hit the button to scan at times but overall scans well for a free app. I like the feature to save scans as a combined document.  I teach and it keeps lesson materials together."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Add the option to let the user scan for the file and not the app automatically scanning the document while the user just waiting for the app to capture it. It's causing the scanned doc to be out of focus and blurred. I hope it gets improved. Add also the option to let the user straighten out the file by manually adjusting the edges of the document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Beautiful interface, works well. Only idea would be for you to be able to edit names and rotate images after you save. Guess that may be the pro-version. Thanks for the great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The previous update was perfect but the new update is force closing the app when I try to change the borders after taking the picture"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Its a really good application. It works wonderfully. The ui is also very handy and simple. Very good application. Sometimes takes a lot of time for detection and sometimes does not detect documents even when present. Things have to be done manually then."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Needs upload to Zoho, Bitrix 24"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"سكانر للمستندات عجيب ومميز جدا"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Greating"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Makes my works easier for scanning any document or paper, thanks . . ."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It gets the job done. But sometimes it's very slow in combining several photos into one in my nexus 5"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I usually took photos of my notes before my exams but the images were cut from sides or either blurry because when I touch the capture button the phone shakes but with Scanbot that's not the issue, it automatically detects the document and automatically captures so no shaky images. And also the file management is good, I can make a single file of my images of each subject, so now I don't have to search in gallery for each pic, I can save the document by name. Love Scanbot!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great, useful app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Lacks basic features, otherwise it is perfect! Seriously, no option to use previous images, no option to turn off magnetic edges = -2 stars for obvious lack of features! Definitely giving it a 5 once these are added in"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best scan app I have used. Many thanks to the devs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Best document scanner so far"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is really a wonderful app. I love the auto edge-detection and document scan all-in-one process. Makes it much easier to just scan a document, have it auto-uploaded and then just move on. Color me a convert from CamScanner (which has gotten clunky and bloated over the last few updates). UPDATE: putting back to 5 stars despite the in-app purchase debacle. The app is just too good after the latest update. But play fairer next time."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Rarely see's the document and this is no different than taking a picture of it with your camera. Pointless!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love how I can point and it takes care of shooting."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app would love a multi Scan. And stitch for closer images my all friends. Us this app good,........"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Could be improved by adding an edit/adjust crop later feature just in case you notice the cropping wasn't perfect afterwards. The apps UI is clean and simple, just how I like it and appears to adhere to the android 5 material design. Overall very promising, keep up the good work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent apo"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Too good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Automatic Document detection,  Brightness editing options, Upload."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Would love a multi scan and stitch for closer images or even a swipe video scan like you would for a panoramic.   Unable to restore pro pack on tablet, says to buy it then tells me I've already purchased it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good luckily"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Cool, very useful...."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does its job perfectly"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"It makes scanning a breeze, the only thing is that I don't always want PDFs and conversion struggle"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The free version is doing nothing. It just takes picture. If you wanna have a real scanner you have to pay $7 . I don't know what they are thinking when there is free scanners with all the capabilities already out there"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Keeps on loading but the saved file doesn't show"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Damnnnnn great..!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Could not install on usb or SD card"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"BEWARE ... Will not refund?!   Hoped it would be helpful for OCR...it was not!; downloads OCR packages only to upload your image to be processed remotely?; slow, doesn't work, doesn't work well at all in the real world.   Hoped I would be able to sign documents...what is offered here is amateur!; only prints a huge touch-drawn signature over the top of your scan; you cannot resize or place it over a document you scanned with the intent to sign perhaps; doesn't offer any digital key signing.  Those two gripes and non-functional features aside. This app is slow and frustrating even to do the basic function of focusing on an image to snap a picture and crop it. It seems no matter what you have to start very far out and work your way in to fill the screen with the document. Bleh...  Not sure what's behind them making a paid app free while also having in-app purchases. Should have bundled it, rather you blundered it, from the beginning. But not giving a refund when I did all this testing in less than 15 minutes is wrong! I would not recommend purchasing it to anyone. I may only recommend they use it for, albeit slow and frustrating, the convenience of autocrop ""scans""."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Perfectly practical, easy to use, and useful."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Superb superb"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Every time I try to scan something, the app takes the picture, but then just sits loading forever. Eventually it ends up at the main screen, but no documents are listed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very nice application"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice and useful APS"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"很好的!!! This app is useful!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice app, it's very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Camera doesn't focus any more, all scans are blurry"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"i've recommended the app to friends who also appreciate the convenience this nifty scanner provides. the quality of my scans is amazing, it's as if i actually used a copier. though my camera may have something to do with this. i just think it isn't fair that they get it for free, while i had to pay for it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, well worth investing in the pro version, extremely flexible. A winner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Better than cam scanner. Good quality"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very good one"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It will automatically find doc..and capture image..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and gives great quality pictures _ using galaxy s5"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Beautiful and simple UI, probably the best-looking scanner app I've ever tried. Price for the pro version is a little steep, not really willing to spend that much if I don't know how well the feature works. Otherwise it is great! Clear results and text enhancements."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and easy to use. Perfect"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Works great and easy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what you expect, quickly and easily. Perfect for quickly storing documents away safely or scanning to share via email, cloud etc"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app to scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It always taking picture before my phone focusing on the object. It is of course the sharpest scanner , but it should taking on a right moment to have that sharp. I have to retaking the picture over and over again. My phone doesn't have a fast camera focus. I'll give it 5 until this taking picture timing problem fixed"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Just what i was looking for"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fast, clear scans, NO ADS, and easy to use."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I have a fairly low quality camera in my phone and that is probably the problem. Very good with small docs but you really need a decent camera on your phone to use this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Just sometimes it wont work"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Amazingly easy way to create PDF document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and the image captured were clear. The most awesome is it doesn't has any ads ."

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good job"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent exact 100 percent"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"One of the better scanning apps"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Wow! What more can one say! Take 5!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Beautiful. My only concern is that you can't set the default directory of the saved documents. You can add it on the next update, or maybe it's already there I just don't know how. :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Its nice experience.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its gudd..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Liked"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"kool"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"loved it!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Would rate less than one star if I could. After a take a picture, app freezes in loading screen and does nothing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Отлично"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"If I haven't used Google drive, it is my favorite took app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great UI and features"

"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Crashes after 2nd scan"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very well."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"ScanBot"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Does what it says very well! Keep up the good work. Getting pro 👍"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simple, accurate, quick. Only possible improvement is that sometimes it won't detect on its own a document."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"App is fast. Auto-Detects the orientation of the paper and crops it. Integration with cloud services is simple. Does not require an expensive subscription like CamScanner. Definitely worth the purchase."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy To Use And Nice UI........"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"خیلی خوب و عالی"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Would give a 4 or 5 stars if I could work out how to 'Rotate'.  I also feel the edit options are very limited.   Add rotate and increase edit options in line with standard pdf readers,  then 5 stars would be my second rating."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The best scanning app I've found so far. This app's ability to locate a document in the view finder and automatically snap the pic is something I've not seen in other apps."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"If you ever find yourself using Google Drive scan or taking pictures of receipts, get this app. You will use it and you will love it. Woah and it can scan QR codes too! But it's having trouble with a white on black QR code."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Phone Camera cam looked completely readable. Completely fuzzed even with flash with this app. Upgraded. Thought that help, now i realize you can't get a refund on in app purchases. Scan bot help me out. Note 2"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good app To download"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The interface and speed are fantastic and I've tried just about everything else out there. I don't need OCR so I'm not sure if the licensed version includes two things I would like: save in a true bw (1 bit CCTTIF tif) pdf format and a setting option to save to an external SD card. I don't want to take apps off to store scans if possible!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great for work taking photos of fuel receipts and invoices to send to the boss!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"2 minutes  of trying  I like it , but could you please add Arabic  to this application. We would  Appreciate it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Purchased the OCR upgrade, downloaded the OCR files, and now the app crashes every time on boot."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"ill give this 5 cozz i saw they giving 5 so..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The best receipt scanning app I've come across, but there are still a few improvements needed. It would be great to merge receipts after taking them, and if you are scanning multiple receipts as a combined document and back out, its unclear how to get back to them or if they were lost. OCR fails pretty badly on failed receipts. Otherwise, great work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not too many features to be bloated, but the ones you need for a great scan with auto upload. Thanks!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It is the best app for who regularly using the documents for scanning"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanbot is an excellent scanning App deserving five stars.  Very clear scanned PDF file even in darkness.  Using flash for low light is an innovation.  Image is cropped to the exact size of the document.  Ability to read bar code and QR code is an addtional advantage.  Unable to find saved documents.  Pl help.  Also unable to find ""document view""    to share PDF document in JPG format."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I love the app was very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Amazing! But I'd like to see text reignition standard. That's where my one star has been left out."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Gooood"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't have autocrop and auto calibration of the photo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Nikku Matharu"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the awesome app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome scanner.. Please optimize it for ART.. Bring in some material design into the app.."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Other companies should learn from you ....  the way you response and reply the user comments ..."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Seems to do what it says on the tin but why does it require access to all those files and what will it do with the access to your cloud storage?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Down load did not complete"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"Why do u need my location?  Thanks for the reply - sounds like you need 2 different apps/packages.  Ill remove SCANBOT and use (the inferior) CAMSCANNER until."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Please upgrade to the better versions"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"For the general public this is probably the best scanner. However, I feel that (1) needs export to jpeg (2) can do a better job at actually scanning. The best app that does this so far is AiO Remote from HP. Scans are crisp and clear even when taken at an angle."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Problems with the perspective and document detection even on excelent document/background contrast and lighting. Keep up the good work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is probably the best camera scanner I've ever had. Takes perfect snapshots. Good for scanning paper bills, payslips, and other stuff. I've gotten rid of all my paperwork and digitized them using this app. UI is great as well. Outputs to PDF and uploads to most cloud services."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"When I try to scan a document the app detects the paper but doesnt focus after scanning the page when I open it I cant read a single line in it.can u plz fix this issue."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Quite productive... I love the cloud storage feature... It simplify sharing"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Pls give support with dropbox"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Traición directa a los early adopters"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The auto-focus and auto-cropping work quite well. I'm glad they've included the option to purchase an OCR add-on. The developer is constantly adding new features. There are other apps that perform similar functions; I've owned a few of them... I use Scanbot daily and it is best in class by far."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Can't even open it since I upgraded to premium."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"For starters, Scanbot is beautifully designed. Its also makes bulk scanning a breeze with its auto recognize feature. Unfortunately, however, it doesn't always  automatically find the borders of my document (and yes, I scan them from a contrasting surface). The quality of the scan also isn't all that great. Some scans appear blurry and other appear very dark even when taken in a well lit environment. If scan quality can improve, then this will definitely be my go-to scanning app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I am very sorry to be forced to award only one star, for I had read a good review in c't magazine before. In the past I had made good experiences with apps by German companies, but not this time. When trying to scan, on my S3 this app only displays a black screen with some circled lines rotating at the page bottom, later replaced by a filled white circle, as if some progress would take place. Reading through the Doo hp I found no system requirements. I'll stick to Intsig's Camscanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This is a great tool, give a tried."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Add fax feature please!!  😏😏"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"...gdrive's integration stops working every time the app closes; reopen it and you'll have to re-authorize gdrive + the configuration is lost."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,".. I loaded it because I'm a big user for Evernote doesn't work just gives a black screen when I wanted to take a picture of a document uninstalled it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Bought this back in April when it was $0.99.  Now they make it to where you have to repurchase through in app purchase.  Now instead of 0.99, they want $4.99.  Those that have purchased now have to repurchase app even they have been loyal and are forced to send in confirmation numbers for both purchases to get the first purchase refunded.  This shows no loyalty to the consumer and people who helped build up the company.  Not only that, but for those of basic knowledge and those that keep every email, it makes it impossible for them to get a refund thus making it where the company stole my investment.  Thank you for showing me the greed of your company, hopefully no one will buy your pro in app purchases."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"How do I get a refund? I paid for this already and now you are charging again for something it should do anyways.  Instead of rewarding really adopters you charged us double?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Einfache Bedienung und gute scan Resultate. Zuschneiden der Seite, mehrere Seiten scannen, hat gut funktioniert bisher. Das OCR addin hat bis jetzt auch gute Resultate geliefert. Überarbeitung ist aber von Vorteil, da gewisse Zeichen zu einem anderen verschmolzen werden. Trotzdem kann ich diese app nur weiter empfehlen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I've tried many of these and so far this one is my favorite."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for app, now with in-app purchases"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Its really worth for professinals regularly moving out of office."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"So early backers paid for the app believing the app will improve overtime, but not at extra expenses to their loyal customers. what we all paid previously has become free to the public and extra features and improvements come at an extra cost as an in-app purchase. REQUESTED FOR A REFUND AND ALL I GOT WAS THE RUN AROUND AND AFTERWARDS, NO RESPONSE AT ALL. THIS IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL. Now they ask me to buy the inapp purchase before they will issue me the refund for initial Purchase. They think we are idiots."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"There is no communication problem, you turned an app that you had to pay for into a free app with in-app purchases for new things. The least you can do is give those who bought it the in-app purchases free. 1 star until something happens about this."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for app and now... Well have to pay more for premium. Not good business model!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app works well, and the UI is slick and modern. Big fan of most of what they're doing -- but unfortunately I too was an early adopter, and I too was taken aback when OCR finally dropped, but only for an additional fee. Like everyone else is saying -- I'm happy to support great devs wherever possible, but that relationship requires trust. By springing previously promised features on pro users as an additional IAP, doo unfortunately ruined theirs with me. A true shame, since I loved their previous effort (Doo Documents). But while $5 may be nothing to some people, it's a ""think first"" purchase for my tax bracket -- and customer service/reliability are a part of that decision. Guess it's back to CamScanner for now.  Two stars because the app DOES work, and the (NOW) free features are good. Just wish I'd know to wait for the real release date."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I liked the doo desktop app so wanted to support them in this app and bought it only to find that the version I bought is now free and we have to pay again for pro features - so loyalty is punished. That is deliberately being offensive to your paying customers you can't blame the play store rules which have been clear from the outset. Paid apps should have upgrades included the better the app the more people will buy it.  But I for one won't spend another penny with doo."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Excellent app! Well thought-out, good UX, attractive, and easy to use. As a software developer love paying for good work, but looking for a bit more pro value proposition to push past my other purchased scanning apps (yes I've purchased 2 others). Cheers."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Sorry to say that like many early adopters I purchased the app and now have to pay again. Terrible business move uninstalling and moving on to a more reputable developer"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"In all my attempts on a Google Samsung Galaxy Nexus the pages came out completely unsharp and unreadable. The app also does not compensate for the usual uneven illumination. Going back to CamScanner, which also has its problems, but at least its results are readable."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"About the same as Google drives scanner but nicer material design ui. Need to be able to rename documents though"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Beautiful app, but shady pricing tactics."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"It's a good app, but I'm disappointed that little to no appreciation has been shown by the developers to the early supporters of this app.  To the developer: From reading the your response about limitations, I have a solution: create a pro unlocker app and give promo codes to the people that supported you from the start! Do the right thing and make it happen."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The best scanner app ever. Unless after reinstall it due to phone factory reset or probably the cannot update itself I have to purchase it. The previous purchase is no more. Sad."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I thought when I bought this app as an early adopter that I would receive all of the pro features. But they go and make it free and charge me for those features again. Now I'm all about paying hard working devs but they should at least give the early adopters something."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for and now is free?! Those that paid previously should get the premium features! Not very customer service saavy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for this app a while ago, as it seemed a promising app. Now I find out that everything I and a lot of others have paid for is available for free (as in beer) for the whole wide world... There are some new features, but if you want them you'll have to pay again?! I guess there's more money in a freemium model... I'll ask for a refund."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"I am saddened that you have spat in the face of your early adopters such as myself. But it's still a great app but I would suggest giving early adopters something to show your appreciation such as swift key did."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Here's my original comment: 4 stars. Very good, great design, OCR will make it excellent!  But come on, I already paid for the app now I'm supposed to pay again because you added new features? Not good at all."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I usually use the camera to take pictures of receipts, but this App makes it so simple. The use of material design is very well thought out and looks spectacular. PDFs are nice, but large. I want to share the scanned items when roaming, for my bad connections that means less than 300kb. Also, I cannot share through Hangouts like I can with the camera."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"First of all the auto scan would snap an image of part of the page. It took several shots to get the whole document in the red box. Once I got the pdf, I tried to send it via email and the file was over 5MB and it was too large for my smart phone to send. I looked to settings to see if I could get the resolution under 1MB and couldn't find anything. I'm glad so many others are having success with this. I wanted it to work. I'll go back to taking pictures of my docs and sending as jpg's."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great alternative to a scanner"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Ok app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Paid for pro, then asked to pay again. Poor business model"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought this several months ago and found this app many times failed to make proper cropping of scan. No categories saving option. And now you want to charge even more for the not so functional scan app. LOL I am back using camscanner since then cause it have more features and works much better. This situation came as SwiftKey case but they did treated their customers more fair. So go give your other paid customers proper scheme for ""pro"" features like you said. I decided to go with camscanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Fascistic app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I tried loads of different scanning apps before settling on ScanBot. Its easy to use, gives good quality scans and connects easily to a broad range of cloud-based storage services. Really well thought through and executed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"The free version comes with unlimited scanning features and supports all clouds. The pro version offers OCR and PDF editing."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Awesome UI."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"the in app purchase of extra features are crap. no way to get refounds. ocr doesn't work."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Not fair to change the price structure after people have paid for the app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I cannot say enough good things about this product. I'm sad that ""the document app"" shut down, but I am thrilled that they were able to turn that into such a success, and use their experience to build such a fantastic solution to the ""receipt problem"".  Touch-less scanning and automatic perspective/cropping blew my socks off. Get this app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"In App purchases in a paid app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"So, I bought the app months ago and everything is great. This morning the app updates with new features, and now I have to pay more to unlock the features? Where does it end? It's like ""pay to win"" but not in a game."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"We pay for the app and then the developer wants more  for ""added"" features? The weaselly tactics a lot of developers are resorting to is getting to be ridiculous."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Dont like to pay extra for an app which I paid for .. and where is the long requested Batch Mode ?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I find it funny and sad when the developer updates the app and leaves out the part that it adds in-app purchase(s). Seen it more than I like. But not surprised by it. Numerous times an app that was looking/working great gets updates that just ruin it in the long run. Charging $5 for the new feature(s) on top of what we already paid seems greedy."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"As a scanner app, it works great. It's ease of use is excellent and multi-cloud service saving rocks! I like the built in QR/Barcode scan function, but it isn't recognized as a capable app in Android intents when you want to use it to scan barcodes from other apps (example: Google Authenticator). OCR works, but seems like a half done add-on since you can only run it on the entire document and then copy the results out to another app. You cannot see or edit it first. Seems like the pictures for the IOS version on the website show highlighting and copying specific text. Maybe this is a plan down the road for Android. Editing is decent with the signature function being the best. The highlighter is not adjustable so it just highlights a large section of text. I would like to see the ability to change the width of the highlighter as well as other colors added. If the barcode scanner was available to other apps and OCR was a little more robust then this app could replace three different ones. Future options I'd like to see: printing, faxing ability, text function in editing for filling scanned forms, and sectional cut-and-paste for clipping into other apps. I still recommend trying it."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"So I buy an app and then they try to charge me again? Please give me my money back, developers. So disappointing for a great app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I have never had a problem or bad experience with this app. Everything comes out really clear."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"it takes a few seconds to take a picture and the resolution is really low (in galaxy s5)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Tried to save a scan but was directed to Play to download the app again. Not very useful if you need to scan AND save docs."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Works great, although has problems with uploading to Google drive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and makes a professional artifact in pdf format"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Better than any other scanner apps I've used."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Simple to use. Does a great job."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good scanner I like the crop tool you guys built in and the option to change the colors. Great work!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Integrates well with Google drive. Would be nice if it had the option to create jpg and gif as well as PDF."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"The quality of the scans is consistently bad, and you can't zoom in and review the scan before saving it. I compared scanning a few documents with another Android scanner app, and the Scanbot scans were all of inferior quality, some of them even illegible, while the other app consistently better results, all of which were legible.   Also sharing scanned pdfs  with Evernote (on the desometimes produced notes without the pdf attached.  Apart from that the app is really nice, usability is great. However, as it does not reliably produce usable scans, it really has not use for me."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I'm claiming a refund for this since the scan quality is insufficient and you can't zoom into the scan before you save it"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Very useful and powerful app, but I hit a weird problem. The saved PDFs are huge, as in the cm length and width of the document. Is there a way to default to normal letter-size output?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Scanned a 60 page doco with ease and the auto feature is brilliant!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Simply easy & in a clean layout design. Thanks Scanbot! :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Good product 5 stars if connect to TresorIT. Not like the nosy Americans to read my scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"As perfect as this app would have been,  the down side is its lack of jpg output. The correct definition of document is not just pdf. We are not asking for too much, at least we paid for the app and we should be able to enjoy what we paid for. You can make pdf the default scanning format but we should be able to change it to jpg if we want. However,  I will still rate it 5 star because its does what it says the best way and it is the best out there."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"An sich nette Idee, auch nicht so schlecht umgesetzt, nach der Aufnahme bei der Bildbearbeitung hängt die App allerdings das Telefon komplett auf (Nexus 4). Kompletter Neustart erforderlich. Lt. Entwicklern liegt das Problem bei Google/Nexus-Geräten. Sorry; aber ich habe keine andere App, die so etwas verursacht, und werde mich sicher nicht an Google wenden - das ist Euer Job! Werde die Review erneuern, falls dieser Bug behoben wird. Derzeit nur 2 Sterne."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I've been using camscanner for a long time, and this blows it away. Its faster, simpler, works better, and doesn't try to sell you a useless cloud service."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is unbelievably good. Seriously, a new king among camscanners."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app is just what I need. I know there are countless others with more options and useless questions. The only thing you are missing is the way it saves. If you take one photo. Saving it as a jpg or any other small photo file would be better and easier to use. PDF is perfect for more than one picture but for one picture makes no sense"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Beautiful piece of software. Nothing less expected from the Germans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Autoscan ist grossartig. Es fehlt eine Möglichkeit, die Scans als Bilder zu speichern, um sie später nochmals abzuändern bzw. den scan nach dem sichern noch zu bearbeiten. Warum wurde neu die Permission ""View and manage the files and documents in your Google Drive"" hinzugefügt? Nur die von Scanbot erzeugten Dateien ist ok, aber ganzer Drive Zugriff? Nein danke."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"It's great! I am always needing to add forms, and don't have access to a printer/scanner/fax machine. This app quickly scans a clear image!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It made quick work of that pile of papers I've been meaning to upload.  It's easy to scan and rename while on the go and allows me to upload once I connect to wifi."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I can see I'll be using this on a daily basis."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very good scanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and does what it says. What more could you want? Also automatically uploads the pdf. Super cool."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app, but I'm missing the possibility to import existing pictures. Please add this, afterwards I'll give 5 stars ;-)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use...High quality scans."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"I tried my best. But nothing is ever scan. The camera would recognize the doc but would then go to a pinwheel spinner and never complete. Someone put a lot of work into it so I gave it 2 stars. But I'm disappointed."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I wanted."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Good features and nice quality. Could do with SFTP uploads to private server"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent quality for music."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent app!! Evernote + Scanbot = amazing experience"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great for scanning receipts. Could use a little tweeking for document scans. Needs to scale images so that all pages are same size. Also need to relocate the rotate button as I'm constantly hit the phones back button"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"I love the way it automatically crop the file. But, if i get options like : importing a file from gallery and saving the scanned copy in jpeg also, then I feel more happy"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"I bought and installed this app today on my Samsung Galaxy S2. When I open the app, I see two buttons on the bottom of the screen. The button on the RHS is for FLASH, which works. The button on the LHS looks like a magnet inside a circle. When I tap it, a large white circle appears between these two buttons. I still don't see the document below the phone. Pressing this button does nothing. I'm still unable to see the document below the phone. Please make the app work ASAP or refund my money!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"And the new addition to export to jpg makes it even better. Would like to see png export next, ability to upload to multiple cloud services, and a tagging feature to upload scans to certain cloud folders for organization."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This app is very very good, but i don't like the realtime camera in the gallery view, also i would like a setting to be able to rename from the preview without pressing menu/rename""  instead rename by directly pressing on the filename. it also crasehs sometimes.  Moto X KitKat"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Still missing some features that were related to the old Doo app that would make things better. Once this is added, I will give it 5 stars."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Great app. Would be even better if could import stuff from gallery ie any previous pictures of documents taken with camera."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"very fast app. to improve functionality such as choosing to save as image scanned doc"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Excellent quality scans. Easy to use. Sleek interface."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"The instant upload feature is great, compared to CamScanner.  While CamScanner will upload to its website automatically, this app's ability to upload automatically to other cloud services (Drive, Dropbox, etc.) Makes it far more convenient.  Quality of the scans are good, and the UI is pretty nice.  OCR would be great, as well as a way of organizing the files in the app (maybe like Camscanner's renaming and tagging system)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"After trying several scanning apps I've decided that Scanbot is the best. It looks superb and functions perfectly. This is proving to be a handy tool in my quest to eliminate paper clutter in my life."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"A small investment in this early product is certainly worthwhile as it is thoughtfully designed and quick to use. Give it a little time to mature and it will certainly become a 5 star app!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"Not all that intuitive. How about including a help file."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Easy to use yet very powerful. One suggestion would be to add the ability to edit scans once they are saved (add or remove pages)."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Love it. Scans automatically, scans look amazing compared to other apps I've used such as 'Camscan'. Auto uploads to my Google drive so I have my scans wherever I need them. I only wish the app had a build in PDF reader."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"This is a great concept with a beautiful UI. It is very useful for scanning my expense receipts, however it lacks the ability to define a destination folder. I use QuickFile.co.uk for accounting and this needs to grab documents from a pre-defined app folder on Dropbox. If this could be added this could be a killer app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"This is the best, easiest way I've found yet to make multiple page PDFs on my phone and get them to the cloud. And Scanbot's support team is very responsive."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Better and cheaper than camscanner."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Very useful, and may even replace my flatbed scanner soon!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Test scan worked surprisingly well. Definitely don't regret buying it and will suggest it to friends :)"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Concerned about other review claiming it froze when scanning. I was able to scan, link accounts and upload a single page photo. If I have issues, will update review! Love the auto crop, would like to see text translation and handwriting to font translation as well. Great app though!!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"So far much better than Cam Scanner. Thank LifeHacker for the bump."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I am wanting to move off of paper, this is a great way to do that for all my bills and receipts. Thank you so much!"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Each time scan only show me circle.  Can refund?"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",3,"This app is just what I was looking for, an easier way to scan items into Evernote.  The only problem is, on my Galaxy S4, the documents focus for a brief moment and then go out of focus almost immediately.  The resulting scan is almost always blurry.  Does anyone know a fix for this?  Also, the ability to autotag a scan in Evernote would be great.  Looking forward to future updates."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"Coming from evernote page scanner... This seems to be miles ahead."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Just installed.   Each time it has scanned the app freezes with a rotating circle symbol over image.  Phone is HTC One running Android 4.1.2"
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",4,"Easy-to-use clean interface. Quality is quite good. Detection could be faster."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",5,"I'm using it to scan invoices and receipts and upload to Google Drive. The most boring part of my accounting is now shorter and sweeter thanks to this app."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",1,"Waste of money! It just takes a picture and simply saves it as a pdf! There is no complex processing of the image to make it look like a scan or anything. Basically all it does convert a jpeg to pdf."
"SwiftScan: Scan PDF Documents","Unknown",2,"The app doesn't work as well as is advertised: it automatically takes a 'scan' of what it thinks you want it to, and this functionality is not very accurate. What is frustrating is that there is no manual mode: why can't I just override the automatic focusing thing and just have it take a scan of what I want?"
