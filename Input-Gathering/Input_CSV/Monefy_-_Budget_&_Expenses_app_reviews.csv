That is to say it almost seems like the code is bugged and interprets my string of letters as a command instead...

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"Very useful app. Needs improvement. Transfers always open with the same two accounts, even when you are editing an existing record, so you have to reselect the accounts. When browsing details, changing between dates and categories, app wont open a single record in a group. Overall, I wont stop using the app, but it needs a better UX design."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"I've been using the app for 5 months now and I am staying because it is easy and useful. However, I will love to have a budget limit per category and when you click on each category, to have conditional color change. For example, green if I've spent less than my 50%, yellow between 50% to 70%, orange between 70% to 100% and light red if I've spent more. I think this shouldn't be too difficult to update, or is it?

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Review after the 2023 updates: The Developer has ruined this app - it becomes unacceptably slow now. My review in 2021 (5 stars): Most expense trackers are stuffed with features and make daily input a headache, e.g. forces you to enter the exact time for each entry. Monefy is a really simple one which allows you to create entries in seconds, yet it provides just enough functions to keep track of your monthly income and expenses. Its interface is also the most intuitive one I've ever tried."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Recently if you add expenses directly from the widget (as I always do/did) it is much slower and also it starts the main app (including loading on the monefy logo).

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"The app looks great, but unfortunately the pop-ups are unbearable and the app isn't useable because of them. I don't want a prompt to buy premium every time I exit out of an option. Ocaasiknal ads are fine, but this is overkill and ruins the app."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"Updating this to drop to two stars. A recent update means anytime you open the app/use the widget, you first have to look at the splash screen for a while, then it loads an add, you close that, and only then is your expense tracked. Expense tracking should be a quick process, how it used to be, but the amount of faff in the way now makes it an insufferable experience. Aside from this, I did really like the app. Simple categories, budget setup (compared to every other app), it was very simple"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"After every expense added I get a 5 second splash screen. Dev mail doesn't work, even tried the ones I googled. I have pro version, but play store shows me a buy button for that, why? Also widget doesn't update the total sum I still have left. Really awful state of the app."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a while, it has a simple ui which very convenient to add expenses quickly I would like few improvements, 1. It would be nice if the Transfers beteen accounts is also listed somewhere 2. Currency conversion is not happening correctly For example, If i am transferring 100 pounds from one account to another ruppee account, it is not converting the pound to ruppee and adding it instead it is just adding 100 rupee to the account"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"The only issue is that the app is opening after an expense is entered via the widget quick input."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app (add free version) for years now. The most great advantage it had was the responseness. Now after the last update each and every time you open the app it takes a very long time to open! Please fix the loading issue!!!"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Excelente"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"Was decent previously, but came with an ad asking for subscription which I must close before using the app's features. This was months ago. Most recent update, there's now an ad before the ad mentioned earlier. I understand that the ad developers need to earn some money, but when it goes to this extent, consumers can easily find an alternative and uninstall."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"It's really awsome and useful app. And also it is easy to use and really wonderful. Thanks for creating the kind of app."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"Have been using for three years and subscribed. But recent update makes it take time to load for 5s to launch the app unlike before, used to open the app and record instantly without loading. The loading time is seriously not friendly."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Loads too slow with latest update. Fix it because it doesn't make sense to wait for 6-7 seconds to make an entry every time!!"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Very slow opening after june update."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"To many adds nowdays, used to be better. Also no editing or adding more categories makes the free version not worth anymore compared to others"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"The app is so good and easy to use despite the absence of currency conversions, and recently, it's taking longer time to open"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Now everytime I add a record, the app will cover the entire screen with a monefy logo for like 10 seconds instead of letting you add more records, so annoying. Widget no longer updates."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Di luar jangkauan bajet"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Was a good app but now it's just broken, the widgets barely work now, and they make you close an ad plus their own ad for every transaction update you make via the app. I'd just avoid it now seems like they'd rather just frustrate you rather than have a functional app"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Used to be a very good app. Now it's getting annoyed by the ads and ""Grab offer for subscriptions"". Even if you pay, the ads and the grab offer page is still popping up. Hence I have to remove my 5 star review and give 1 star now."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"The app open time slowed down drastically since the latest update. It makes it less practical to quickly add my expenses and overalls makes the app way less usable. Initially I thought this was because of ads but the slowdown happens even when using my paid account"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"This app really fits my needs and does exactly what I need it to do. Simple and easy to use. I have been using it for a long time. The was no problem before. But with the recent update it started to pop up an advertisement - special offer. Every time I open the app, the advertisement pops up, which is really annoying :( Please make it not to do that. Thank you."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"This app is fantastic and I use it every day to keep track of what I'm spending. Unfortunately the latest update has introduced two issues which lead me to uninstall and find the previous version: 1. Submitting an expense from the widget was causing the splash screen (where the logo is shown for a few seconds) after every single submission. 2. The message showing the recently added expense was never disappearing. An update that is just ""general improvements"" should not cause this."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"Kiss. Keep it simple stupid. Works exactly the way i wanted it too. Great job making it! I posted that years ago but now having problems with a simple feature like activating budget mode. Not sure why and hoping a Dev can help? Also, please remove the big green screen when opening app. The delay is unnecessary and causing me to like the app less. I know it's monefy, I downloaded it and paid for it.. You don't need to show me the name for 4 seconds when I open the app."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for more than three years. It is a great app for noting down our expenses very easily. The app use to be very fast but after the recent update (june 2023) it became a little slow. It will be great if we could have the feature of setting up budget for each category on monthly basis. Overall this is a great app on the finance section."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"Much slower to open now. What's going on with this latest version? Previous versions of the app would open instantaneously. Now it takes several seconds and takes away from what was a great experience."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"It has become useless since the latest update. It showed an error every time I opened it and when I tried to report it the email doesn't get delivered.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Only feedback is since the 5th June update the loading screen takes twice as long, makes it laggy to quickly add entries at the till."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Hope this gets attention of devs: 1. Your support email does not work 2. I have Pro version of the app but on PlayStore I see a Buy button on it. Does it mean if the app is uninstalled, I would have to buy it again? 3. Reduce the Splash Screen time. It doesn't really have to be 5 seconds long. Please update correct contact email so that we don't have to give negative rating to grab your attention."

For example; I want to limit myself to spending R3 500 a month on a expense catgory and I want a reminder of that budgeting goal. Perhaps im hoping for a bit extra from the app, but, it would be swell to see where im spending within budget and where Im out-of budget.

If you accidentally delete one of the categories on free version, you cant get it back unless you go premium or re install the app. And when you delete all categories, you would only have 1 left and then your stuck with only 1 category unless you go premium or reinstall.

When you set a date for an expense and open the calendar, the app always brings you to the current date. Say for example i'm logging in my expenses for january 2022. For each expense I have to go back to january manually because the app brings me to february. It would be nice if the calendar remembered in which month were you adding expenses.

Why are the accounts displayed at 1/2 of the screen with miniature numbers? Why cant you sort them? This is just a short list. Best thing about this app is that others are worse."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Great app for shared expense tracking. My wife and I both use the app to keep a running tally of how much we've spent each month. Using the DropBox sync feature, we are able to easily keep a combined total of expenditures. I like that you can customize the categories and how you use the app as well. FEATURE REQUEST: provide an option to display an average daily spend for the month so far. E.g. if it's the 10th of the month and you've spent $700 so far, average daily spend would be $70."

Suggestions: --ability to mark bill as ""paid"" and reflect in balance; incase you pay early (THIS WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL) --ability to repeat transactions, since sometimes you split your salary between 2 accounts. Drawbacks: --alerts don't seem to work, but I check my bills all the time anyway. --sometimes it counts a future payment into your current balance."

I cannot initiate a refund and get the function I want. Lesson learnt. NEVER BUY THE MONEFY PRO FROM THE APP. BUY IT FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE."

The other issue is that the balance reflects the totality of the month, if you have a repeating scheduled deposit say on the 20th of the month then it is included in the balance from the 1st of the month so you could go overdrawn before the deposit arrives."

So instead of analyzing 1month(30 or 31 days as per Calender) income-expense, we can analyze income-expense between 2 salary Credits."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"The app is attractive and has some nice features but it suffers from some serious issues. As a budget manager, it fails completely because there is no way to add income to your budget during the month. As an example, say you purchase a shirt and you subtract the cost from your clothing category. Then you decide to return the shirt for a refund. When you try to add those funds back into your clothing budget it doesn't work. The app lets you log the addition and at first glance you might think that it worked properly, but if you check you'll find that your funds remaining for the month does not increase despite the addition. Your remaining funds balance is now incorrect. Every budget app needs to be able to handle funds going both IN and OUT. This one only handles funds going out. The developer seemed disinterested in fixing this issue when contacted. There are other issues as well but this is such a basic budgeting function that if the app doesn't do this properly, it's time to look elsewhere. UPDATE 2021: This developer is now completely unresponsive so be aware that if you have an issue you will be on your own."

If I enter 6 and press x (multiply) without a second operand, it will be added with the value of 36. The same goes for other operations as well‚Ä¶ I have been waiting for that bug to be fixed but I just decided to report it since it took too long to be fixed. Thanks for offering such a great app."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"I buy the Pro version. However, the UI still need to be improved. Could you add the account name when we add new income/outcome? The symbol is too little, especially if I have teens account (same symbol can't be avoided). Also, we don't know what account we used for income/outcome on the report directly, I need to edit it first to know if we filter by all accounts, don't we?"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"I'd rate it a 5 stars, if there was not a big bug affecting the overall balance. Two currency mode is not running right. The app is based on number mode, rather than currency mode. If I'm summing two different currencies - it sums the numbers and doesn't make any exchange. I offer adding at least an option to mention the currency exchange rates manually. This will be a big advantage to your app."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Excellent budgeting app, has a very well thought out workflow. Adding expenses and setting up recurring payments is as easy as 1, 2, 3! Pro version is a cheap one-off payment which enhances app even further, very smart widgets available as well! I love that you are able to create your own intervals to judge your spending within. The only downfall I can find is that you are NOT given the option to link certain expense categories to certain accounts - happy to change to 5 stars once possible :)"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Superb due to its simplicity. I'd recommend anyone purchase the Pro mode since, unlike most budget apps, you can buy a cheap, lifetime licence which adds the useful ""recurring payment"" feature. I would give it 5 stars if it added budgets. You can only have 1 general budget, but it should allow you to set a budget for each category."

I paid for ""full"" fermions, it is not a lot and do not regret it. But this app have to go very long way. Simple excel file way more useful."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I use it as an expense tracker to keep up with the amount of money in my accounts. The problem I have is I keep getting variation between what monefy says and what my actual accounts say. This could be my fault as I forget to add transactions here and there. I think it would be extremely helpful if I could link my bank account with monefy so that my transactions would automatically be loaded onto the app. That way, I can't miss a thing."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Useless!! This app has no feature to add subcategories which I feel should be standard in all financial apps and usually is. I had to pay for the app to discover this as they do not allow you to add custom categories unless u pay for the app. Now Google won't give a refund even though I literally wanted a refund within a few minutes as soon as I discovered this.

I downloaded the app in her phone but there is no way I can sync both. No way more that one person can add the expense in this app. This was the reason I uninstalled this app even after purchases it's pro version. Money gone to waste.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"I bought the Pro version after trying the free version to use the multi currency option. After playing with it a little, found out that there are few things that could get better. For example, please add cryptocurrencies to the app or at least let us add custom currencies. Or another problem I found is that if you add different accounts with different currencies and include all of them into your balance, it will sum all of them into 1 currency instead of showing them separately based on their currency! The other thing is that you cannot set budget for specific categories, for example for groceries, just a general budget which doesn't make any sense."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Great app with some great options and features, but could do with a few more. I would like to be able to set transfers between my accounts to be recurring, since currently I need to manually do my standing orders between my accounts on pay day.

Furthermore, sometimes when I enter specific expense numbers such as 28.8 or 55.5, the actual value registered is somewhat like 1353 and 5324!

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Bought monefy Pro as an iap on one phone. Currently on my new phone and with difficulty was able to get my data transferred, but my monefy Pro was not transferred. Fix that and it can easily be a 5 star rating. Also, sync from gdrive or dropbox can only happen if both monefy are pro versions which is really dumb when the new phone has the base model. Edit: somehow after one day, monefy pro carried over and now I can use monefy pro on my new phone. 5 stars as promised!"

It has simple and easy to use UI, it's very much convenient to add expenses like food, transport, shopping, stationary, rent, recharges etc., and at the end of a month, one can track his spending habit and thus can improve on that. Now there is a serious loophole I'd say which is you can backup and save data but can't restore it from that backup.

And I have over a dozen weekly expenses and a weekly payroll that I do not want to have to individually enter...not to mention the chances of accidentally forgetting one somewhere in the 650 entries it would take to do just that portion of my budget.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever used. Too much nice interface."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP! I know it's only ¬£2 but it adds up. Downloaded it and liked what I saw so I immediately bought it - the type of impulsivity that proves just how much I need budgeting software such as this. However, after about 5 more minutes fiddling around with the app I then found there's a glitch! After you use the calculator (if adding up expenses, for example), it just makes everything go to hell - you can't add income or expenses, rendering the app completely useless. I tried clearing the app's cache, restarting my phone, and all sorts, but nothing worked. I then sent the app's help centre a message to see if they could help me fix the problem and if not, give me a refund. They didn't respond, and the time spent waiting for a response is probably the reason that my request for a refund through Google Play didn't work. So don't buy this app. I don't like writing negative reviews but the makers of this app shouldn't be making money from an app that has such a fundamental flaw. I understand that this could potentially just be an issue with its compatibility with my phone, but the fact that they didn't respond to my message alone speaks volumes. If they don't respond to my polite request for help, they're not gonna respond to you, either, should any issues arise."

Edit - Something else I would REALLY love to see is different kinds of graphs to visualize my spending. It's genuinely fun to me to keep track of and that would just make the experience better in my opinion."

I've really enjoyed using Monefy for the last month or two and have gotten multiple friends to try it out who are enjoying it just as much. I would recommend this app to everyone!  I would like to request the addition of a fortnightly view rather than just Day/Week/Month/Year. My pay, rent, and most of my other bills are all expenses/income that occur fortnightly, and it makes every second week look weirdly lucrative or weirdly expensive when it's not able to be lumped together.   I also wouldn't mind being able to generate a graph of expenditure over X weeks/fortnights/months to easily compare which had been more expensive. Further to that, more specific category views would be cool to be able to compare over X weeks whether I was spending more on one particular thing (e.g. eating out)."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"It's good app, But certain things must be incorporated. 1- Editing should be easier. 2- Credit Accounts / Payable Account must be included to track Debts from ppl. 3- Receivable accounts must also be added, as transferring money between accounts doesn't seem appropriate in case 2 & 3."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Been using this for a month now and I'm quite happy with it. It's got just about everything you need and a lot more with pro features. If there's a reason its not getting five stars it has to do with their color scheme which is kinda dull (just cus im a ui/ux nerd) and editing a record doesnt show the save button until you open the number pad(UX issue). It auto saves per change though so its not a big issue once you understand that. But otherwise best of the bunch I've come across so far! ü§ìüëçüèæ"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"I just downloaded the premium version of the app and it looks good so far, but the reason for 3 stars is that the app doesn't import conversion rates directly. This is something you should think of. I pull rates from Bank of Canada or Xe automatically on an excel spreadsheet, so can you. I would change my rating if the app starts doing that. Also I need 2 main currencies; right now I can only choose 1. My girlfriend should access to the same data since we manage our expenses together."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"To the developer: I purchased the PRO version since i've been using the free version for quite some time. (1) But the exchange rate precision is lacking since it only gives an exchange rate of 100 from it's base currency to the other added currency. (2) And it's exchange rate calculation is incorrect. Eg try to input 0.00952 as exchange rate. Unless these two problems are fixed, I would not recommend you to spend your money on the PRO version."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Ive installed and uninstalled a few financial apps. This one seems to have the easiest and most practical functions so far. Super easy to add income and expenses!

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"Great in a lot of ways. It's a really simple and effective budgeting tool that let's me track travel expenses quickly and easily, but it has some serious flaws. Synchronisation between devices is finnicky and should be a lot quicker and easier. There's also a big problem with how currency conversion is handled: the exchange rate has to be entered manually and for absolutely no good reason it will only accept rates up to to 3 decimal places. This means if you're converting to a currency with a low value you can only put in a rough exchange rate (or none at all, if there are more than 10,000 of that currency to the base currency), meaning spending in that currency won't be accurately converted by the app."

A feature I'd like to see in the future: Looking up one subcategory I named (for instance: Bus Pass) and easily being able to see how much I've spent on that. It would help give the user an insight on just how much they spend on specific things and see if a fix is necessary. Once again, ‚ô•Ô∏è it."

Also, it doesn't show bank transfers between accounts in the expenses overview unless you specifically go into that account despite selecting all accounts.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"I love this app and there's only one more thing I think it needs before it can be perfect. It would be great if I can group my expenses into sub categories. The reason being so I can group them into ""Needs"" ""Wants"" and ""Savings/Investments"". +10 points if it was a drag and drop UI where I drop my category icons into little buckets. This app is great for tracking expenses and that's helped me become conscious of my spending habits. Next I need to make an effective budget and now being able to group my expenses is necessary. The budget mode doesn't go that deep. I'm currently using Sheets to do that but I'd like to not have to copy all my data by hand."

I love, that it supports transfers between the cards/cash/accounts and you can in any time include or exclude your cards from the total ballance.

I bought the pro version and I added my own categories and enjoy the night mode as well. It was worthed. I recomend."

No calendar view. Or even a list view to see all your expenses together. Dashboard seems good but that's all you get for 150 bucks. Andromoney Pro at 190 is way better and feature rich. Doesn't even have a refund option for the money I paid. Andromoney has the refund option too if someone doesn't like what he gets."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Clean, minimal design. It feels intuitive to me. I was just using a list, almost lost my mind to monotony. Might sound childish, but the soft colors makes it feel quiet but lively. Also, only been a week and a half and my urges to shoot my self in the financial foot have been halted. Feel like I won't be borrowing and cash this month. Here's a hint for people who have spend-itis. Make a new catagorey ""Upcoming expenses"". Go ahead and enter whatever you'll be needing to spend money on between now and the next paycheck. Bills, gas, groceries. Deduct how much you want to put into savings (common idea is 10% of your income). Now you know how much you have left over to use however, with much less concern. You only get old if you stress. Now go experience something, you won't regret it. Have a good day. Thank you very much, to the creators of this app. It is simple and perfect for my crazies. :)"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"This app was great a year ago. Then I changed my phone and I could not retrieve my backup data from the sd card, so I stopped using it. Now I wanted ti use it again, but found that it has been significantly maimed in that year of time, regarding what you can do for free. You can't even change an icon for the categories any more and if you delete some categories to add your own, it wont let you. Two stars only because it was kinda good once."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Generally quite good. It has a well designed interface and it's very easy to use. However, it could do with some improvement. An option to set montly recurrent payments and incomes + an option to add payments that occurr only once a year. For example if this month I paid my university fee ¬£1000 and annual travel card ¬£2000 it should average this out over 12 months to show a realistic monthly split up."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"I've bought the full version of the app. It's a nice app that helps me in managing my accounts. First I used to do everything on Excel, but now it's easier with a mobile app. I'm using this app daily and find it nice and useful. However I find a few things missing in the app. 1. The funds transfer between my accounts is not visible under the normal view of 'All accounts'. It is visible only if I filter by specific account. 2. This is the most annoying one. When I export my data to csv or Excel format, then there is no option to select a period. It always exports all the data from day one. There should be an option for selective export. 3. When I see the balances, it shows the list of expenses and incomes, but it does not show against which account it has been made."

cleared. Right now I use it home tab, but when I get the money back I have 
to clear it again and again and it gets a bit tedious. Just that one 
category. Thanks. Fun using this app helped me know where i spent loads of

much I have left before meeting my monthly budget AND how much I have left 
in general in my savings at the same time on the app somewhere."

it, represented with interesting diagram, and its very easy to use"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"Apart from not allowing to change the order of icons which is already 
mentioned by every other person. You must give an option of generating

are easy and the cute icons make it fun for data entry. One thing I really 
like is the graphical breakdown for the categories, so you can easily see 
the percentages of your spending. One thing I can suggest though, is maybe 
add a functionality for recurring expenses, like rent, internet bills, and 
such. Still mulling over getting the premium one as the free version

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Apart from the unfortunate choice of colour palette (dreadful pastel tones 
which deem some text and icons really hard to read) it's a great app that 
leaves other big names eating dust in terms of minor, less flashy (but no 
less important) features, such as the total freedom of setting whichever 
first day for the month or week better suits your particular needs. Get rid 
of the dreadful colour scheme (or let us change it on settings) and you'll 
have a real winner in your hands!"

Interface is great and super easy to use. But, I think what would make this 
app 10x better is if it could be linked to my bank account so that all 
transactions are automatically imported into the app (to save us of the 
manual hassle of inputing everything). Then, we could simply categorise 
each transaction appropriately so that everything can be displayed as 
nicely as it already is. Please find a way to improve on this!"

It would be better if I can use it on the browser. And with  password protection enabled, please don't ask for verifying many times in  the same session ( until manually closing app).   Update: After a day of usage. It suddenly appears some events since 1970. Maybe issue with datetime when the phone is disconnected from internet. Then everything becomes chaotic.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"Paid for the Pro version immediately. Perhaps a mistake?   Good features, however the omissions are simple things (like being able to sort the list of expenses, which currently only sorts itself automatically on the basis of the $ amount)...   Impressively simple User Interface but the faded green colour background with the grey colour text and again, the faded green buttons are a horrible combination (as in, barely visible)... plus, make it a livelier greens, have contrast between different elements! Surely that's not very difficult.  Lack of information on what you get with the Pro version (seems like you have to pay per device, which isn't mentioned anywhere... All the promotion shows is 'Sync with other devices')... and their website is basically nothing. I've contacted their support team, let's see how that goes.  Also, the functionality isn't all there (intuitive button locations not adhered to, need to use the in-app number keypad to enter $ amounts instead of the phone's numerical keyboard being triggered, inconsistent implementation of the 'Back &lt;-'  button... saves the transaction when editing an expense, discards it when adding a new expense)!  But for someone with simple needs, I'd recommend this. I tried 7-8 apps, and while they have a ton more features, they're complex to the point of just using your Online Banking app instead. This is a good alternative. They just need to fix issues, add more features and polish the existing stuff for it to be awesome."

One problem though, might be user error but if I put in a deposit on one day, it would be useful to track the deposit through the week without having to add it manually. Ex: if I put $100 in on monday and spend $20 its $80 but then the next day it starts back out at $0 and I have to input that I have $80. The same with adding. If i get another $100, it won't just calculate it out to $180. There should be a a calculation daily, weekly, and monthly for the amount of money you have left."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"Nice looking app but I was not happy with some things... I had 3 accounts set up including my income account. If I had for example $1200 in my income, $1200 in my spending account (transfer from income account) and $700 in my savings account, when you selected ""all accounts"" it gives you a balance amount of $1.00. I can't even find how this has been calculated. Its really bizarre. There are a few other similar issues too. The balance appears to only be calculated on the first day of the month so any savings added or expenses later that month aren't shown in the balance. At least that's what conclusion I came to.  It's just not quite right and after 6 hours of trying it I uninstalled it."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Nice simple interface, great for tracking low level expenditures such as coffees, lunch, etc which would otherwise fall off the radar. I would like the option to edit the list of previously entered Notes, to remove typos and near duplicates from the auto-complete suggestions.  Having moved from Weekly to Monthly budgeting there are a couple of other improvements it needs. I would like to add recurring payments. Income payments don't get added to the Monthly total but they did get added to the Weekly one. Not sure whether this is a bug or as intended but it makes the Monthly budget option considerably less helpful.  I already have bought the Pro edition but I would pay again to have these things addressed. As it is I may have to look at other apps to see how they handle Monthly budgeting."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"I use this all the time, and would've given it five stars had it not been for some minor inconveniences. The fading animation after adding a transaction seems to disable touch while it's running. So I have to wait a bit if I need to punch in multiple transactions quickly. Also, I wish there was an option to directly set the account balances. Right now, if I enter a value, it assumes that to be the initial balance and applies all the transactions( I think so). Overall, some more attention to human factors in the design would really make this app perfect. Other than that, it's simple to use and does what it's supposed to do, which is great :) Hope future updates will make things even better."

Ideal for a mixture of budgeting and recording expenses at the same time using a combination of accounts and categories, I recommend this app over any others for its shear simplicity of use and also the complexity of money management it's capable of achieving. It's really helpful for keeping track of your savings, money you owe or even money owed to you, budgeting for all time frames and daily expense or income recording. A+ from me, I've tried almost all apps on the play store including ynab and this one appeals to me the most because it doesn't restrict you to a set way of budgeting or money management."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"I'm a contractor and I've been using Monefy, Expensify,  Money Manager, and Spendee, to review them and see which one I will use for quarter tax reports. Monefy is the fastest one and most intuitive (Spendee is a close second, in my opinion).  Sure, it does not have a picture function, but this is why it uses less space on your phone and remains fast. I'll continue testing Monefy with other expense tracking apps, and I will supplement it with a picture-scanning receipt app like Expensify, Evernotes, or something similar in case the tax man comes knocking to my door :)"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"I purchased the pro version and it's great. I've chosen this above all of the others I tried for months. But there's a few things missing for me. 1, would be the ability to set a limit for each category and then see a bar or something that tells me how close I am to overspending. Another (although much less important) would be a darker theme option. You guys have done an amazing job with this app and I'd never look at another budgeting option if these features were available.

From there you can make some financial goals and focus on where your spending habits need to be adjusted. Great Little App."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Easy, simple, colourful!"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Definitely the prettiest finance app and likely the most intuitive, however it really lacks a lot of functionality. If you want a basic spending tracker and don't have very many accounts and don't need lots of graphs and tables, then absolutely grab this app. If you're looking for something more powerful, check out Bluecoins (highly functional, higher price than Monefy) or Wallet (has the most features compared with the many apps I tried, but has an expensive subscription model). In the end, I do recommend giving the Monefy trial a shot, it is good. If the Monefy graphic designers worked with the Bluecoins developers it would be a dream come true..."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"They've tried to keep it simple by using icons, the problem is there are no labels or any way to turn them on so you have to guess what things are. It could be a good app but due to the UX I'm not going to bother finding out."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Great little app, I thought it was worth the ¬£2 to support the developers and add some more customisation.  One missing feature for me would be to set custom periods. I get paid 4-weekly so I can't get the most out of the service as I have to manually change the date each month, which messes with the integrity of the data. Hoping this may be added in the near future."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Hi, great app!!! But  It is missing just one little thing. I have turned on the budget mode and it is showing me the amount I can spend per day. But the problem is that it is also including the one time payments like rent etc in the daily limit and that makes following the daily limit difficult.   If the app can allow to add rent separately and calculate the limit based on other categories that will be great.   Thanks for reading."

I just got my check on the 29th and am not able to skip ahead to January 2018 to add the transaction which is forcing me to do everything on paper again which nullifies the purpose of the app. Fix this issue and the app will be absolutely perfect.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"This app is a thing I have been searching for a long time. It has all you need to keep your finances at hand. My only objection is that it would have been nice not to include the deposits and savings in the display with your salary cause if they are all in one place for you to see it is easier to leap your nose in them. I would have put just the current salary for display and the rest separately in a hidden sector. But still. Great app :)"

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Good App, but missing subcategories/tags and recurring bills/expenses. Also, user interface is not ideal: ""+"" and ""-"" buttons are too big related to the rest of the app interface, and app keyboard design is outdated (it's a decade behind the Toshl, for instance, regarded the overall graphics).  However, it's very intuitive and simple, on the other side.  If Author would tidy up those details, it would be the best Finance app out there. P.S. I am using Pro version (commercial one)."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Used it last year and was great. Had to change my phone and now apparently the update comes with a must-pay for new categories. I'm not saying quality should come free, but I'm tracking my finances because I don't have the money. I will stop using the app as it has no more use for me if I can't customize my expenses, it would have been nice to have a limited number of categories at least. I would understand paying money for statistics and things I cannot easily do myself, but for the very basic thing that the app does... nope. Thanks for last year though."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Couldn't get worse when the free version of the expense tracker app wouldn't even set you to your single preferred currency."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",3,"The app is ok. I give it 3 stars.  I upgraded the app but, unfortunately I didn't  like the new features...   So within 2 first hours I tried to cancel it and ask for the refund, as I have done with other apps... But there was no option. I contacted them via email and no answer...   I suggest DO NOT UPGRADE IT, if you aren't 100% sure or you will waste your money."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Would give it 5 stars but I miss two features which would be pretty good and I would even buy the pro version of the app: the search-ability of the past records (both expenses and incomes) - it would be great to search for groups and substrings. The other I miss is that there is no opportunity to add a recurring item which automatically (mostly monthly or it could be decided manually) would take place in the listing. Although it is still a great app.  Update: exporting doesn't work, it generates an exception."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, brought a pro version. However, few features might be added. When I add money to the savings category, I expect, that food cheques, utility bills will not be substracted from it, because it is something that I want to save for later purchases, so this category should be like a deposit.  Also, the savings money should be able to be substracted from the salary.  One more thing, some income and outcome should have a repeat option: salary, rental, savings."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"more category please"
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"This is the first app with which logging expenses finally worked for me (after another, desktop-based app). It is easy to use (I bought the premium version at once, to be able to use my own categories), stable (!!! - I am not afraid my logs will disappear or get corrupted), and doesn't ask for any unnecessary permissions (which is important for such a private matter as money). It could be improved (e.g. it would be useful to have transfers between accounts (which are included in the balance) to show up somewhere, because if I have made a mistake when logging a transfer, there is nowhere to see HOW MUCH I need to correct it for; also, when I'm behind on logging, I might sometimes not remember whether I've logged a certain transfer‚Äîand there is no record of them). But it is already hugely useful for such an ADHD-addled individual as me. With the widget, every expense is a tap away from being safely stored, and I see my balance at a glance."

I wanted to carry over my information from my old phone to my new one, and so tried the multiple ways this app recommends - transferring through NFC, storing and re-downloading from Google Drive, saving the document as an individual file onto my SD card and then transferring that to my new phone, but nothing worked. It picked up the file downloaded from drive as an option to reload the backup, however, when trying to implement this, the app forced itself closed and then reopened about 30 seconds later, without any of my old info.  I would recommend this app as long as you're not considering getting a new phone in the near future."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Used to be really useful but know has very few categories to select from unless obviously you pay. Really disappointed to redownload and find this the case and will no longer be looking at using this app as you can get far more useful free versions than this."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",2,"The ability to add more than four accounts is attractive. But this app unfortunately cannot compete with my current budget tracking app.  There aren't any extra features, such as shopping lists or debt management. On top of this, the UI is far too finicky when I compare it to Wallet (the competitor made by BudgetBakersl).  I am also dissatisfied with the use of Dropbox as a syncing mechanism and with its implementation. The idea that this function should be charged for is ridiculous.   These elements have left me dissatisfied üòí. If you are seeking a comprehensive money manager, then this reviewer recommends that you move on."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"A very good app for tracking your spending. The budgeting mode is near perfect for my use, although the 'accounts' feature doesn't really work with it. The only thing this app is missing is the ability to view spending over time (week to week, for example) as a graph or table."

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"I have used various expense manager applications but none of them were able to fulfill my needs. Monefy is the one which has fulfilled my most of the needs. It has very simple and nice interface. But still I m giving it 3 star because of it's poor support from team.

"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",1,"Nothing in the way of automation or smart behavior. E.g. you have to type in all your subscriptions every single month. It remembers titles, but not prices. No integration with bank accounts. Whenever a new month rolls around, the shortcuts for adding an expense to your most used categories are reset, which is honestly baffling, because it represents a frustration that would be incredibly easy to fix."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",5,"This app makes it so easy to track my spending,  with just a little personalizing I was able to make it work for me perfectly!

The only thing that I really wish it had was the ability to set recurring payments, I have regular bills that are always the same amount on the same day and inputting them manually is time consuming. Adding a weekly/bi weekly/monthly payment option for this would solve my problem!"

Please get an expert to improve the user interface. Thanks."
"Monefy - Budget & Expenses app","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, I've used it forever. But still, you haven't added the ability to schedule regular transactions like damn near every other financial app. You finally add that, I'll rate 5 stars and get the pro version.
