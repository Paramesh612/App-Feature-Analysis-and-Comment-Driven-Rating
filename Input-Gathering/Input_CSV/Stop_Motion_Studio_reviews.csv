"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So good hope"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a good app. The only problem is I cannot get a remote camera button to work in the app. I have tried a couple of different makes of remote button.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thank you for helping me during my practical exam assignment for school graduation. It's really a very helpful tool for making stop motion, 5 star worthy."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's really good app for stop motion makers like me and I have really smooth animations like if I would have to go in premiere and take pictures on like a camera and like do that and upload it would be hard but with this app I just take a picture move you don't have to really do it in premiere I could just like import it into capcut"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a great app and is very useful, I just wish you could record on the app. There is a couple other problems that I would like to be included in the game such as being able to change the frame rate and background/color theme, but other than a couple preferences I have, it's very useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You can't even erase for cool effects,you can't even set how to make it without having to pay premium,bet you can't even upload without having to pay premium.But it's the thought that counts."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. But I have to say, it doesn't focus close objects on my Xiaomi 13T Pro. Stop motion often requires shooting close objects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is good,however,over the past few days it has not been allowing to take pictures and I do not know why. But I accidently gave this five stars,but because of those problems,-3 stars."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app used to be great, however recently there's a bug that whenever I try to filming the camera always set back to default settings if I left it open for a while and its very annoying if I have to set it right again and again. Can you please fix this problem? Thank you very much."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"To add any imported sounds you have tobuy premium"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"All okay. but export option should be more clear. I tried everything and only then I was able to download my video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It was good. Then the features didn't work."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I whont let my download this app so one star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for all levels of stop motions. There is simply nothing wrong with it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need ""Premium"" to even do what the app is supposed to do."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"fun horse things that you can make"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"EVERYTIME I TRY TO RECORD MY AUDIO IT GOES 5 FRAMES AFTER! FIX THIS OR YOU'RE KEEPING THIS ONE STAR!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Previous version included timer for free but upgrade removes that. At that point, with all critical features requiring pay, it should be a pay app. Don't trick me into downloading and then demand payment. Demand payment up front."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Ok so I really love this app it makes editing my videos really easy which you can watch at @ColdStopStudios on YouTube but yeah the 5.99 PRO pack is TOTALLY worth it it helped a lot too"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The camera is upside down, I think it's only my device but can you please fix it! Otherwise this app is great üëç."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"it works pretty smooth, abit hardto navigate though"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wonderful application! I would very much recommend using it If you're trying to get in to stop-motion animation, it is so useful!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It works alright but so many basic features are behind a paywall - even deleting frames."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Even if you can't afford the paid version this app still has a lot to offer. (I do have the paid version) I mostly use this app to make Lego Stop Motions for my YouTube channel, and I have had no issues so far for the first, coming into second year of making stop motions. There isn't much better than this app as well. Like this is the only singly dedicated app to stop motion. If you guys are looking for somewhere to start making Stop Motion. I would Greatly encourage you to try this app!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app! I just wish it had gun sounds so I can use it for my videos. I'm stuck using music till I find sound. Check out ML Animation Pacific War! ML Animation is my YouTube channel. Please subscribe!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great, but A lot of things are locked behind VIP."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"West"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Horrible, desde cu√°ndo hay que pagar para tener una opci√≥n tan b√°sica como importar una imagen de tu galer√≠a? Hasta hace apenas unos a√±os, en esta app era GRATIS hacer eso y m√°s, lo que hoy ahora es una opci√≥n ""premium"". Si lo que quieren es que su app no la use nadie, lo est√°n consiguiendo. Una verg√ºenza."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I make cool videos with it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid for the 'all features' upgrade for my son but green screen is not available"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It deleted my movie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible paid and got nothing i hope someone sues them!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great and fun I used it for the first time but for art class when we were doing a stop motion with oil based clay."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is the best animation app I have tried yet, and I have been through MANY. Personal issue here,but if I were to buy pro, it would take the money and not give me the features üòÖ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"You can do different things ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice motion app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think this is a good app to use for stopmotion. I've used it for a while, and the only thing that bugs me out is the premium version of the app, but the base app is really all you need to learn what stopmotion is."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good for movie making"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's a great app üëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It has everything you need. Don't know why it's 3.9."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I think it is a fun app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is 100% recommended, and I'm editing a movie that might come out soon! You should install this app! For the people at when this review was sent, Happy new year"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing, though I have the full pro version and a few setting are always bugged. Such as the ""focus"" on the MANUAL setting."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Took 5000 years to install! UGH"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good I like that you only have to pay once to get pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It was working fine but now all of a sudden the audio keeps glitching and playing right at the end of the video instead of where I put it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It is utterly unusable for vertical shots. Keep in mind and don't waste money as I did."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"We need to pay to add pictures from our phone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Phone broke but saved all but this game."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great game! The features are awesome but there's a problem. I accidentally deleted the app so I reinstalled the app but when I went to create my project the screen went black then sent me off the game completely. Please fix as it's still doing it!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's perfect‚ú®"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I guess this app is good for beginners who have just started learning about stop motion, but if you want a convenient advanced stop motion app, this is not for you (unless you're willing to pay money). So many features are locked behind a paywall, like merging frames and intro/outros. A better way to create stop motion on android is to use the app Open Camera to see the onion skin, and use the app Inshot to remove the background, as both of these apps have a smaller/no paywalls"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"So I was making a video for my youtube channel, and I was going to erase my hand off of the images but I have to pay for it, so can you please change that. But is is good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool apps"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"capitalism"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really REALLY GOOD!! I used this to make animations of godzilla for my videos, for a free stop motion app it's pretty good. but I will say on my opinion buying pro is better because you can add openings and credit scenes to your animations for final touches. Overall it's pretty good! Very easy to learn for beginners"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Downloaded and couldn't even upload images without paying for premium subscription to use very misleading I do not recommend installing unless your going to do live recordings because uploading images requires paid subscription."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I use this app to make pacman claymation videos. I love this app. I remade pacman the musical, along with a sequel video I made myself. And I love how the stop motion technology is easy to use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"User data issue, not sure why the user data is always static even after deleting projects and the cache. Takes up way too much space. When last cleared it had 5.7GB. Seems sus."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very fun and easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"terrible app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Having numerous problems with audio recording and I can't erase previous recordings."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's super good, but I gave it 4 stars because you do have to pay for stuff in it, and it's quite confusing some time, but still well done because it's super good!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the E-mail I used for current status"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I have used this app for quite some time now. It's great overall. Recently, a friend of mine lost all of his stop motions. there was no way to recover his 5 years of films. I am strongly hoping that there will eventually be a way to put a sign-in feature in the app, like a password, or a Google sign in feature. there is no way to secure the app, and you cannot login into another device, so if you have the pro version, and you lose your progress, you can't login and recover it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"No way to export. I've spent ages creating something and I cannot for the life of me see how to export the project from the app so it's essentially useless."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I TURN IT ON THEN GO ON TO MY MOVIE AND IT'S ALL BLACK THEN I TRY TO TAKE A PICTURE AND IT FREEZES AND DELETES THE LAST TEN FRAMES!!! PLEASE FIX!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Great overall but it sucks that you have to pay for everything! Can't even flip the camera without a fee!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This app has downs and ups but I feel like there's more downs, it does function pretty well but every single button you press to edit your movie. It's premium only, and I'm a broke boy so I can't afford it. Please add more free editing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Went pro."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its really helpful for making videos to post on YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So cool Game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"jts gool n"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"My kid loves this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"My experience was amazing with this app. Though I assume you see the 4 star rating. I don't think that this app is very useful for editing or something like that. I once wanted to edit my video but it didn't let me. It says that I need stop motion plus. That annoyed me like heck. I couldn't do anything besides make a boring stop motion video. But if you are looking for a app to make perfekt stop motion vids (without edits and stuff) then I recommend it ! But if you want an editing app we'll....."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Devs: I paid for the Stop Motion Studio app but I see a Pro version in the store. How is Stop Motion Studio Pro different? Can you please make the app compatible with Family Library?"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"good app but my phone can't support movie files. please make it so that you can save it as mp4."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app for stop motion. Although a payment is needed to unlock a lot of the features, it's actually a pretty cheap price and it's not even a subscription or anything, it's ONE payment that's around 8 dollars. And considering that you get really good features like being able to erase supports and overlay sound effects and a bunch of other really advanced stuff, I'd say the price is good. And even the free version is good to. It has everything you need for basic stop motion animation."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"bad bc it bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is good, but when I go in to erase my rig for lego stopmotions, the app only blocks out the rig with a shade of white that doesn't even match my background! And when I'm erasing a rig that's in front of my set, the app just erases the prop! I added a masking frame of my set without any figures and selected it, and even still! It continues to annoy me! Edit: Lighting issue. App is great."

Other than that I love this app to make projects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I want to have given this app 10 Stars if it wasn't so ridiculous crazy first off you have to take a picture you can't use a photo because if you want to use a photo you're going to have to pay premium the premium is so high to the point where I can't even pay it you it cost is 25.00 a month the animation is so poorly it's just sad sometimes it doesn't even want to work and sometimes when I put it in one of my videos it's just sloppy to the point where I just deleted and if you want to add music"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"OK, this app is really fun and cool to play with, but the one thing that I really hate is that you have to buy a premium pack to do anything then.Otherwise, it's a really boring app. I do not recommend this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Please fix the camera, it's blurry"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is such a good way to start stop motion everything is incredibly good. If your thinking about buying premium, BUY IT!! ITS SO WORTH IT. There's Only One Complain I have when you have 1-2k frames plus you can't properly see your stop motion, because if you press play the stop motion is laggy. (But it you download it it won't be laggy)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I downloaded this app and I feel like I got scammed because there was an option where I could upgrade to Stop Motion Pro and when I paid nothing changed. I have to download the other app to get it and pay again, but it doesn'thave a log in option either. Also, I can't adjust the images in the order I want"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's cooll but it keeps bugging out"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app! The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because a lot of things in here costs"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing app no problems with taking pictures or adding sound effects. So why the 1 star? You can't edit the sound for some reason anymore. I was working on my movie one day and it was fine. The next when I tried to edit the sound it just froze and that's as far as I get. It's only for that movie too none of my other ones. I can't even import it onto my Google photos anymore. Fix this and it gets a 5 star if not it stays. Also can't even see my movie when I click play. Has been fixed now a 5 star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The new update is terrible! üò°üò° It ruined the entire app and also my stop motion career!!! Because I can't use the timer!!! Please make the timer free. üôèüôèü•∫ü•∫ That's the only problem I have. Everything else is perfect. üëç I would have given this 5 stars if the timer in the app was free."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app I love it! I got the pro version now. One thing that was annoying before I got the pro version was that it looked like I could use some of the pro functions but couldn't actually. Also after the recent update I found the recording function confusing for a while. Great customer service too. Wish I could give this 9 stars instead of 5. It did somehow lose the pro version twice after 2 updates but they were able to fix it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app. my favourite one. I use it for my stop Motion hobby. daily. the one time payment gives you a few extras... if you're doing stop motion, this is the app. edit aug 15. hey guys, what happened to the timer? i paid for this app and this new update took away the timer. not sure what else it did, but can you fix the timer please. dropped from 5 stars to 3."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Who makes someone paid just to put a image on a screen seriously it's horrible do not recommend if you want to edit"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's good but allows more things to do without having to pay any money."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sure, every stop motion animator says its great, but its not. It won't even allow you to use your own camera unless you buy the pro version for 6$ a month! They fix that, and then it great like everyone says, but for now, i cant use my new camera because these greedy owners want people to pay to do anything. My recommendation is to dewnload a different app, because this genuinely sucks at almost everything. Worst stop motion app ever!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst animation app chi"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"An app so good that I didn't even use it as the pro features are what I need and I'm broke so it's useless to me rn. But damn is that Ui clean, it loaded faster than any app I've used and it's got all the features I need (In the pro version lol) I'll buy it eventually and leave a review on the pro version to see if it gets the last star but 4 stars without even being able to use it for what I need is impressive as hell"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It was good at first but when I zoom it for a couple frames I'll zoom back out but it will keep it zoomed in"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Was a tad worried it the app would be difficult to use, because of the number of features it has. But turns out it's super easy to create a video, and move/copy/duplicate frames. Outstanding."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app used to work great on my phone but now it randomly freezes and does not save the stop motions to my gallery when I click save as. üòë"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good, easy to export, and adjustable and toggleable onion layers"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Spent 3 hours of my sweet time on an animation and it never exports. Generally one of the worst experiences I've ever had."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿÆŸàÿ® ÿ®ŸàÿØ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I would rate this app 5 stars but I'm not because you can't use important features like erasing without paying."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"NO! not only does it lot let you import your own file, it also asks for money! Don't download this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"so good. i like it so much, it is so easy to use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"After the update the app has not been working as it was before. For example I can no longer use special effect and play the animation back. When I try to do it my screen freezes and closes the app. This is fustrating."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Normally the app works just fine, we have updated to the pro setting and having lots of fun creating movies in it. But in the past two days app keeps crashing, you can't change things, adding sound affect just freezes the app - it is extremely frustrating and I find it hard to explain to my kid what is happening and what could be done to fix it. So FIX IT!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Ever since the new update I cannot download my projects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"So I was doing a jumping scene and when I needed it to erase the object well you need premium and I think that erasing should be on the free app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"it's SOO good I bought the upgrade pack or whatever it is"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good and all, the only two problems that ive had with this is sometimes my camera goes upside down for no reason. And also, the other annoying thing is that when I play my stop-motion back the bits on which I've recorded with my voice aren't played back to me."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"So this isn't really a review. I give it five star because it's a great plotfrom the start Although I only have one complaint That It's doesn't transfer data over. So let me explain I was making this huge Stop motion movie/video When my old phone broke. I was very sad and unfortunately since my video wasn't fully completed When I re-download the app on my new phone The video I spent 3 months working on was gone. And all of my other videos too I just wish there was a way to save them."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Perfect stopmotion app, best of the best"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app just literally updated yesterday and the project I was currently working on will no longer load play or even allow me to access any special features.... the app was working perfectly before this update now it's full of obvious bugs"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Installed the app but images locked behind paywall. Uninstall"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Works great. I don't bother using the recording and sound affects since I can do that on my editing app. Although it has more sound affect choices. So if it was more affordable to a kid like me that would be nice."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"If I could I would give it 0 stars I spent 1 minutes taking photos on my phone for a stop motion and I have to pay to upload it from storage"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super good but add a Flashlight or Something"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Unhelpful! Too many premiums, Cant even make a movie with this!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Adding images from your photos to your stop motion requires paid upgrade. Instantly deleted."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to animate if your starting out you should definitely get the pro version but overall it's worth it no adds which is a relief for me and you should also get capcut so you can edit the animations that you've made"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"you have to pay to do everything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This it the worst. You have to pay 5 dollars just to unlock sounds and backgrounds and to use photos, so don't download"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Can you pls make so that you can get audio from video in your stop motions"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Really nice app but almost useless without support for external usb cameras. Would gladly give it 5 stars and be ready to buy the pro version for an even higher price if it would support this simple feature. My 7 yo started to play with stop motion but putting the tabled on a tripod and using it as a control surface and a camera at the same time is just painful. Buying a dedicated phone just to act as a camera is not a solution. We already have a very good usb camera."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is useful. I made lots of movies w the app but it does not have a green screen.I think they should add a green screen ASAPüôÅ."

I can't save anything to my drive, and I spent weeks on a project, 5k frames and only saved 5 seconds out of it. I am becoming disappointed in the app more and more. I would like it if they would just stop removing the feature from me."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Spent 6 months recording a video. Saves a 1gb mp4 that cannot be played in anything, including VLC. Saving as animated gif results in only the first 10 seconds being saved. Saving all frames as individual photos in a zip results in them being saved in a multi-part zip & only giving you part 1 that can't be opened. Customer service is also non-existent so this can't be solved."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Noob not working üòï but it is very helpful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Very cool app. But I was trying to save but didn't work at all in to my animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"horrible because there was premium and I'm only a child which I'm 10 how can I afford premium if my parents dont allow me to I want everything free to make smooth and clean animations this app is click bait for premium money dont try if u dont want to."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app for adults and kids!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this to make stop motion but I don't like how you have to get pro to do other stuff like putting sound effects but I just got a editor app but I use this app pretty often so I recommend it."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Salo kamino..jab har chez add krne par premium hai to ye app free download pr kyu lga rkhi hai"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I just used this app for a middle school class project. It worked perfectly! We used the 1 frame per second setting and did cut paper animation. The final length was 3:45 (225 frames), and it exported perfectly! The timer setting on the camera was very helpful as well. We did 15 seconds for scenes that only needed minor adjustments between shots, but we also used the timer at 3-5 seconds even when we did individual shots just to make sure the camera was properly focused before the image saved."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"A bit laggy but ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Boring"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"If you have no spare money. I am not recommended to buy this app. It is VERY strict. You want to chat? Get the 7.27 $ version. Plus, I payed for it and I never got it. So I think it is not recommended. 1 more thing is that almost everything is pay for better. Why does this app exist? When you can delete this and get the other version. Plus, get another app for stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is so easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The project I am doing will require me to do longer videos . Yet the app only does shorts . Not only that, but if your going to add the video to YouTube . It will not show up in your gallery . The video is nice but why pay 5.99 for editing ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Hate it omggggf bruh üòí"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"App is great but you shouldn't have to pay for the useful things. And need a tutorial"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really easy and the pro is cheap best one ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Low rating since you have to pay to add pictures from your gallery to the app? Make's no sense. For a stop motion I 100% disagree with this decision from the devs. If it's such a hard request atleast give users a set amount of pictures imported from the gallery per project..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Didn't work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good app, but I want to export the individual images taken within the app so I can use them elsewhere. Can this be done? If so how?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why is importing images paywalled lmao"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything that is cool on it costs moneyüíµ and u can't do anything fun without the premium!üò°"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I make some videos which are cool stop motion quality a bit"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a fun air bad lots of fun making stop motions"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Not gonna rate it right now because I a bit pissed off at it, I've been working on a prodject for a while now and suddenly it says that in can't find the prodject, this was probably over a thousand pictures for a stopmotion test and several hours of work flushed down the drain. I've tried everything but it won't pull up and the deadline is coming up so I'm pretty much boned."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is cool its really awsome but i wish the earaseer and drawing and other is free cus i think its not very worth it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"So much fun and good for me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty good considering it's free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've been playing this game for years and it's super simple and easy. The sound can be tricky but the stop motion is very nice. üëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super great way to learn stop motion!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best stop motion app ever :) ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great! That's all I can say"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like it but I want to do the credits and title but it's members only."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app is a POS. Paid for Pro, it doesn't work. Can't even upload from my phones camera. No one to contact. Waste of money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"What happened? Why does the pictures I took look stretched? It doesn't look like that the last time I used it few months ago. Now I can seem to make a 2frame vid because it looks weird with the picture being stretched after taking it. Hope for a fix"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I would like for there to be finer editing over larger audio files, as I want to pick one sound out of a large group or sounds and use just that. It would also be nice if there was more sound effects such as reverb or pitch."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing for stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Exceptional. Well, kinda. I really like stop motion, you should like it too. There's just lots dto do and so fun. However, isn't stop motion just moving something with pictures? Well, you can do way more than that, cuz of the edit tool in premium. With that, I am making such good moving art. It's great. Try it."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I love this app it is very good for kids when they're just in a mood to make a short video my only problem is you can't insert your own images you can't do anything and if you want to do something else you either have to buy it in this app or the other app. This is fine but I much rather only pay say $1 to add my own images cuz that's the only thing I like insert backgrounds, I don't want to pay for all this other stuff I'll never use but overall great app especially great for kids."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is good but I had a issue with the pro version I bought the in app purchase one and i switched phones but when I installed the app I lost my premium so I'm pretty sure that if you buy the in app version you will lose it if you switch phones it was really stupid"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good app really good at making stop motions but audio is weird you need premium to edit anything also you cannot have your flashlight on at the time so you cannot record videos In The dark"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"is boring"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I have done a few YouTube videos with this app and it is fun! It's a very clever app because it doesn't take storage when you take the pictures, it keeps it in the app itself, then it puts you animation in your photos app. I've used this app a few times and it works so far so good. üëçüëçüëçüëç"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I own a chromebook)) Most of them time when I entered the app, it glitched out and made all words and images pixelated, not just in the app. I also think it needs a way to import old videos. And, I am having trouble using the tool to magicly remove objects, and changin the backround. Overall, I like it, but also hate it. It even deleted one of my vids!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Het werkt heel goed"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad movieüò° it's need premium I HATE THATüëø"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is best app üòÑü§©ü§©"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The paid version does not provide more than a clumsy erase tool, the effects of which cannot be saved. Practically no editing tools whatsoever. It's a blind man's tool. I definitely regret i paid them."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üëçüòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"so glichy unblevabol I spent 4 hours on so thing and it took 3 sec to finish don't download unless you want to waist your time!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app was my childhood. I LOVED makeing LEGO stop motions and uploading them to YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a great app but I deleted one time and then recently reinstalled it but my pro was no longer there and I cant figure out how to get it back"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good stop motion app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cannot disable feature that automatically changes focus EVERY TIME I take a frame. Wastes so much time. Also, the different focuses I use will change whenever I close the app slide or leave the app for long enough. By this I mean say you have 4 objects in the frame. First you will only be able to focus on objects 1 and 3, but then close the app slide or re-enter after long enough and you can only focus on objects 2 and 4! This ruins anything you try to make if it needs precision! PLEASE fix! >:("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app makes me have the most CREATIVE ideas in the WORLD! This is the best stop motion app EVER!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have to pay to edit! But it is still a good app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So beautiful so"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The onion skin suddenly stopped working about a month ago and nothing I do fixes it. My app is up to date, and I even uninstalled and installed the app again just for the same problem. I have cleared the storage on my phone and restarted my phone, but nothing works. Stop motion is so difficult without onion skin, so I rate this app a 1 out of 5 stars for this very important reason."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It focuses on everything else besides what it needs to focus"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've had this app before and are now using it again, I remember having a blast creating stop motion movies with my figures, the easiest and most fun stop motion app ever(in my opinion)."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I don't like how you have to pay for so many things"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love this app it takes a very long time to do it but the more time you do it the better it is"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Goooooood yo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Not sure if it's good or not. Can't explore needed features without paying first"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Cool and fun in all but there's one serious problem, my premium gets cancelled I've rebought it multiple times but it stops at a point and get this, it says one payment yours forever."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The reason why I gave you 3star almost everything there is bound and lock my child can't do what he wants, work on that"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app i used on my mobile my uncle told me about this"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Audio trimming please fix the size to select how much audio you can select for a video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"At first app was great but with new update trimung audio is now not easy where before you could make the area of audio you wanted small to pick different effect sounds but now its wider so editing audio now is bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"worst app ever!!! kept glitching the photo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ):<"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good i can make animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It works, but for some reason you can't record sounds. You can see it on a timeline, but it is completely silent on highest volume and wgen recording pbviously loud noises."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I hate this app it doesn't work at all I made a video and it cut 3 quatres of the video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I hate how just when ima make a video boom you gotta pay"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Please show me how to log in in this app, but this app is so cool I love it that's why I rate it five stars. I used it when I make stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is the bvest"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app very helpfully for creators"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"ketp asking me for premium but when i click of it apperd a second later"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app does not allow you rotate the screen, so the camera HAS to be positioned at the bottom of the phone rendering use very difficult unless you use the app upside down."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its so good with playing my stickbot ü§ó"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I recommend the app because I think there is no other app with the same use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I loved it it works so well"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app for stopmotion!! You get to have really good stopmotion!! Although you have to pay for the features it's still great!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Sucks you can't rotate it in the app and if you export it and rotate it you have to pay to reinput it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is cool and all but it's too fast And like whenever you talk it doesn't go with the character that you're using."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I used this app 3 times and it is pretty good but I'm downloading it again for youtube."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is great,but, it has a lot of things that you need to pay for. I Would recommend that they at least put the titles and credits for free and KSH 800,That is very expensive,especially during this time of inflationüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüò°üò°üò°"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"A very good system,though I wish you could do more things.i want to be so that premium stuff is normal so people can access it normally.apart from that it's good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great for beginners, and pros alike. If you want a free, smooth , good and/or a good quality stop-motion app, this is the one."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing. It can do almost anything."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is overall great but for some reason now I can't export any files even though it was working perfectly fine until now"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good but I can't fix them because my mom doesn't want to pay"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is the best stopmotion app ever!!! I love it! It is sad though that you have to pay for special effects but I can just use other free apps to edit it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good I've been making stop motion movies for while and when I found this app I couldn't get off it :]"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"So bad it is impossible to draw and delete what I don't want and the face is useless because of it staying close."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Okay, so I have been using this app for years now and have to say it is one of the best animation apps out there. It is truly good for beginers and hobbists alike. It is fairly user freindly and for the five dollars I paid years ago it is truly worth the price."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Fine, no watermark. The 1 thing that makes it a 2 star review is that whenever I'm making a stop motion. There is a 100% chance I'll encounter the problem of when I click the button to take a picture of the frame, it won't take it and make a weird noise and it'll only take it if I'm shaking the phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Top bought premium I advise everyone I like it thank you!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is so fon"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love using the app, but I also think it could have had a few other features. For example if you could pick up a sound byte and just move it to the correct frame if you made a mistake."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"WHY DO I NEED PREMIUM JUST TO MAKE IT A FILE????????"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app. My only complaint is the problem with exporting videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It would be better if you dodnt have to pay to add images but other than that, its good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Still learning and help needed with erase. I am liking many features. Overall - good. I've tried using the 'erase' function but when I rub out the 'rig' holding the flying object, the background colour is slightly off - so the object is followed by a smudge. Would love to develop my grandson's interest and skills but the results with this function are poor - unless someone can explain where I'm going wrong."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I was able to make an hour long thing on this just the flaws are it's premium over all it's awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ü§óü§óü§ó"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"L boxo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It breaks on my ZFold S23"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was amazing and I had so much fun using it and it helped me make so many great animations."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's free and has what I need to make stop motion videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This App is Ledgit Perfect!! I Create all my Stop Motion Picture Video Content on here."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not free app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I loved the stop motion but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because why do you need to buy premium to get sound effects, green screen and other stuff? If I can't buy it, it will be boring for some people."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is so good. I like this app but it have very weird sounds. But this app graphics are very good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I had it on my old phone a while back and remebered it. It has never let me down and... I guess it does it's Job just really well."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's good, but when the video comes out, it's very glitchy and not like I would expect, please fix it and I will use it ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cost money to delete something. I'm deleting"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bro , this app says they're good as they are actually. When I attempt to record a movie , the camera is just blacked out. Even after if i reinstall. You Goobers."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it's the best app in the world"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Such a scam, when I make a video it ruins"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"add photo must premium?! kapitalisasi"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is so useful for stop Motion Studio! I always use ot when im making an animation it's so easy! All you have to do is,prepare your animation,take photos by moving things at 1 step each! Reminder:use the right fps."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very bad quality I hate the new update I like the old version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best stopmotion app u need anything stopmotion studios got it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is great 10/10 totally recommended. But today I tried to edit my project but it said pay for premium! But I did pay for premium 2 years ago! :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Really good app. It's got a few touturials and some good basic settings. You get some preset settings and backdrops and whatnot with the premium. However I had premium and when I got a new phone it said I needed premium again, so I'm back to the basic cause I lost it. It's heavier on the space it takes up, just wish it would have kept my premium and that the features wouldn't heavily rely on it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It was good, but the camera was glitching out on chromebook. not as big a problem on phones or tablets, but still, when im uploading stop motions to my youtube channel, a glitched camera is not all that great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is so easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nylo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I dont like how you have to pay to add effects and backgrounds. Other than that everything is good as it is easy to make stop motions. Best. app for beginners in stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I feel like rotating your cameras shouldn't be a paid thing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cures boredom easily. But takes alot of storage"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it to make movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very useful. Would highly recommend it if you are a beginner or an expert. The only downside is that you can't clear out individual things from the cashe, only everything in the app at the same time. This results in me, who makes many things for youtube on this, stuck with around 25 gigabytes of Cache storage, and the files I'm going to need in a couple of months I can't delete or clear out the cache without Clearing out the whole thing. Still an incredible app, just needs a few quick fixes 8/10"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app perfect for projects and funny movies :) thx u for making this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I can't download it but in my school I play and it's very very fun!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The app is great, but the audio is weird, and it's annoying when I want to edit the video like putting text on it but it says that I need premium for that (I use a different editing app for that). Overall the app is great and I'm giving it 5 stars ( plus the customer service is great.)."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"An amazing app that lets me turn my plain old Lego in to movies. Really recommend this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It sucks it just gives me a blurred camera and i cleaned ny camera like four times and it was still blurred"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The experience has beem good so far. Made some animations and posted on social media Is it possible you you to donate or give me the Pro version?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The most annoying thing is trying to view each image and clicking on a frame and the menu pops up. It annoys me too much and i just installled this app. It would be better if the menu was a long press or double press. I installed on my phone, it takes up half the screen."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"bruh so good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"If you can't export longer videos like GhostlyPearl. Try clicking Share instead of Export."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"cant move frames into places, so if you miss a frame your screwed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Stopped working after 1 week and the pro version is really bad when I tried re installing it didn't give my pro back and it still didn't work"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love this app it really cool and it also fun i give it a five star, you should try it really fun."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is very cool but there is only one problem for some reason it is very laggy when I take pictures with it but who knows it could be the stand so I would love to give it 5 stars but for now I'm going to give it 4 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The worst app i ever see"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's OK, but it's stupid how we have to pay to do anything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I paid for studio pro 2 times !!!!. One time on google play and one time in app and cannot install it !!!!. Developer stolen 12¬£ !!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I filmed 3 videos but when i tried to play it, it wouldn't play and there wasn't any sound and my volume was all the way up, disappointing"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"doesnt focus up close on note20"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I don't even think this app deserves one star, you can't even import pictures that you already have"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It was is amazing app I was happy with how my stop motions turn out so then I bought premium but becuase I didn't buy the other app I couldn't family share.Lots of the premium features are great but I could not for the life of me figure out green screen! It was so confusing and green screen was the main reason I spent 5 dollars on premium! Just to clarify I have a Google pixel phone so that may be why my green screen won't work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"When I play my stop motion film,I cannot hear the audio. Please fix this if possible."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good app but needs some work but good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Goodd"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is great, but I'm giving it four stars because there's too much that's on the paid version. I want an app that can be used to make videos with as many features as possible. This app works, but there's too much you have to pay for. The payment is cheap, though. It's like 3.99 a month. So it's not expensive. There's just not enough on the free version."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good for making stop motions (just visual, physical stuff, and stringing it into a video), but would rather use other video editor for SFX and VFX."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good for beginners. However, something is wrong with the fade tool. If you make it fade in, it autocorrects to no fade, and if you choose fade in AND out, then it corrects to fade out and only out. It's been like this for a few months, and they still haven't fixed it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's overall amazing but some features are not in Samsung galaxy tablet."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for what you get."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Awesome!!! Best stop motion by far!!! üî• PLEASE JUST ADD A FEATURE TO SAVE CAMERA ADJUSTMENTS... It's annoying when I need to film the next day and can't remember what settings I used the previous day."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it helps a lot and it's easy to use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Needs to pay to make a film from already existing photos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty good but I don't know why it exist"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Unrefined and clunky. A deadbeat money grab at best."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I just can't dawnload this thing and I can dawnload other apps"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app just we have to pay for a lot of stuff and I sadly can't afford the pro version can you guys please make more things free"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When i tried this now it just offs the app so it is so bad i have a chrome book so it makes i guess sense"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very simple although annoying you have to pay for the sound affects"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like it but I wish you could be able to erase stuff without spending üí∞ so pls just make it so you can do that without spending money pls or I might just look for a new stop motion app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"3 stars it's because of the freakin premium it's always a premium because every single step tells me like drawing over or making face animations or all that stuff it's always premium there's nothing I'm gonna pay that for"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad App"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love stop motion studio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Make a stop motion of cars 3 teaser trailer"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Neat and all, but when you hit the shutter release it doesn't instantly take the pic. For some reason in 90% of the frames my hand is in the pic adjusting the model - the same hand that is pressing the shutter release on the other side of the tablet!! How? Stop motion is slow enough, I don't need to wait extra seconds at every exposure."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"rubbish..waste of money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a great app, but the only real problem with it is that the exposure is a little touchy."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's not a 5 cuz you can't get your account back :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Awsome app i love it its so fun its so cool how you can chose your back ground and you can also make sound effects and it works with green screen to so much easier to make animations play it now"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The ap is fine but customer service sucks. I had to order twice to get on right phone and asked for one refund of 5.99 that I never used and they said no. Despite me having a million problems trying to get it in the right child's device. Really disappointed they can't simply refund because of issues with devices. Not going to recommend them to anyone if that can't follow simple customer service decency."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Best Stop motion app out there...... And premium version is also worth it.... But sometimes sound doesn't syncs well with your animation."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really like this app. It's allowed me to get back into the hobby of animation again with the flexibility of using my phones superior camera. I also like that I can import images into it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a meh cant turn the camera around on mobile"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Is so good if you doing stop motion on your phone"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Beautuful. My first video was so smooth, and the app is easy to use. If I could, I'd rate 500 stars just to show how fun & easy it is! As a Youtuber, this really comes in handy!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Beilliant!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like this app but after some animation i.cant see the full animation if that problem is solved then this is the best stop motion animation making app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its simple and works well. I made a lego steve walking 1 stud and then falling, it was very fun and easy. If your looking for something simple but works well this is great! Also no ads is a chefs kiss to this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like it. Definitely the best stop motion app on phone I've seen. However, the green screen feature, editing out rigging and many other features (that I was never even told was premium until I try to use them!) are premium! Is there any way of transferring the premium onto another device you have? If so, I will purchase premium. Overall, a decent app, but very basic without the premium."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"App worked 1 time, then it was straight garbage. Couldnt see where my camera was pointing on the screen, and it wouldnt let me review the motion. 100% Junk"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üëçüèΩ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I downloaded to make stop motion if my microscope. Already taken pictures can't be used without premium, so I couldn't import the image from the microscope. Useless unless you want to take pictures on the spot."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"But bro why there's no edit color????"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I HATE THIS SO MUCH! I can't record on my phone while seeing the actual video. I try to send it to my computer, and it doesn't send. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. 1 STAR."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It used to work really well. The today we made a stop motion video and when we went to play it, the video won't play. Every time we try it just says Working and the blue line repeatedly fills but it won't stop"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I loved this app, but soon after I bought pro, I realized that there is no option to turn the camera vertically. üò≠ I use this to time-lapse record my art, and the only option to make it at the dimensions of a phone screen is to take 1/4 of the horizontal camera, which makes the resolution absolute TRASH even in 4k. Pleeeaaaassee fix this, if you do, this will be the app of my dreams."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Hey guys. I don't know why but I gave this a 5 star, You know, I didn't buy the new update. I like it without it, bye."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this game! Graphics are so good and it's so easy to make your films! (most of the time) And my school even let us play this game to record cool stop-motion movies! In my opinion, using a mobile might be the best way to record each movie you make! I prefer this game because the other stop-motion games aren't as good as this game! Some things I hate are - sometimes it doesn't let me see my movies -my movies sometimes get deleted when I press on them Hope this helps!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"EVERY THING COSTS MONEY EVEN ROTATING YOUR CAMARA"

I accidentally do something wrong and go to fix it but, nope! I have to redo it all over again! 2) This ones' just a suggestion that would REALLY help me out. If I can move my drawings that I do in the edit section, why can't I shrink them? It'd be annoying to have to make one of my drawings smaller and identical. 3) Sound. The sound effects play twice and you can't fade sound. Fix it."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Shite"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I just love it I can do it for anything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I bought several features a long time ago and when I switched phones, they are not there anymore, nor are my movies. I have the same Google account on both phones. The app does not function well"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This game is excellent, but I do feel like some feature such as green/blue screen should be in the not only included in the premium version cause they are very simple things and they should be accessible. Now here is the things I felt impressed with. 1 Compared to other stop motion apps the quality is superior. 2 It is really easy to make cause it's just a matter of a few clicks to make a masterpiece. 3 This may be biased but this might be the best stopmotion app in playstore"

So I deleted it to see if would do anything it kinda worked but still kept acten up so I will give Stop Motion Studio one more try"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The only issue is that the focus doesn't seem to work super well on the S10+, but all it takes is to boot up the camera app, let that do the focus, then go back to this app, and it'll be focused."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good sometime burly"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like the animation in this app because it has way more than other stop Motion apps. This app is worth it even if you don't have the pro version because it's still the same animation. The pro version is for sound and higher quality."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app! But it takes a lot of time to download but it's still a perfect and awesome app! I love it so much üí™üëçüëä‚úåÔ∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"really bad. cant take picture because it puts lines through camera. it is not because camera needs fixing because i have fixed it and cleaned it, dont reccomend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Takes up 1GB thats a bit much on a phone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's a good app and it's free and is great! Most of the time. But... sometimes (a lot recently in particular) I'll be making a stop motion and at some point it just randomly gets blurry and I have no clue how to fix it, I try clicking on the character I'm mainly focusing on, hoping the picture quality will improve but it stays blurry, Even if I change the lighting in my room. Once it even started blurry from the first picture I took and through to the end of the whole stop motion!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The Best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I dont have words to sayabout this amazing app its wonderful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"How do you post it to YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Useless. As a kid im good at this by training, but its a problem for paying for backrounds. Also clips?, make up your mind. Theres a lot of people who are good at it but also broke, what will happen?, happiness?,this is not good for your other. App. Also called stop motion pro also costs money."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I can make stop motion's super easy I can make my own background and let's make a movie üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The reason why I use this app it's a post videos why do you make it so complicated I can't find it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"An option to be able to go back to the original when using the editing and erasing option would be much appreciated... Every time I accidentally leave the erasing or editing screen, i cannot undo any changes I've done. It's very frustrating to have to duplicate the whole video incase stuff like this happens. PLEASE add a colour picker in the editing option"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like this app but its annoying to me that there is a pro version.Its because when i want to erase something in the film i have to have the pro version to do it but in other Countries that there currency isint dollars it could be more expencive so im just saying just take some things out of the pro version and put them in the normal version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Please fix the app, the new update is terrible, the camera quality gets too blurry even when you try to focus on something, the green & blue screen is even much worse, it's too bright and distracting."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sucks app all need to buy like erase nneed to buy to erase is so Important"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good for filming. Great interface and menus. Pro isn't worth it though, editing the videos later is much easier and free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Why I am giving it 4 stars is because when I had just renamed my project and tapped on it and tried playing it it did not work it said it was working but it just did that forever and did not stop. I don't know if it is just happening to me or if it is happening to anyone but yeah. After that the app is a great use and a awesome stop motion thing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app does have good logistics and onion skin camera, but the picture quality is absoutley horrible! My camera quality was 10x better than the picture that showed up, and i can get better quality from just using the camera app. Would not reccomend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"this is the best! I just wish we didn't need to pay for sound effects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I made my first animation and it looked good though it did keep my stumped for a bit."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love the app I only which that some effects where Free."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This is a very good app. I make stop motion all the time and have always used this app. I do highly recommend it. Unfortunately, I had to give the app 3 stars, because of the new update. The app used to run smoothly and work very well, but ever since this update, the app is slower than a snail. This slowness causes many problems with the app and it is very annoying. It wasn't an update, it was a downgrade. I will change my review back to 5 stars once the slowness is fixed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Hello, I assume u have come to reas the reviews to see what it's like. I have not used it yet so keep looking"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I feel annoyed right now, as this is the app I have been using for my short films for a year. Today I realized there was an update, and I was having fun until I was implementing my sound. For some reason like many other reviewers, my quality is absolutely horrible when it comes to implementing effects and music. I tried absolutely everything I could think of, and no attempt restored my audio quality. I feel turned away from stop motion for now. I hope this gets fixed in a new update."

Can't file the program file path anywhere on android to do a file restore. Customer service is slow to respond and the help page has no insights or information. Very frustrated right now."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Got this a year or so ago. It worked perfectly. I opened the app today and selected New Movie and there is an aquarium filter in the background and I've been through it all and i cant remove it. I went in to play store to see if it needs updating and I see a lot of people suggesting the same thing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"An amazing stop motion app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app was Amazing untill they updated it and now force you to buy if you want to download your own video in 4k where before it was free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great Animation we will start youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"After the recent update, I find myself completely unable to export movies. I have over 50 stop motion videos on my YouTube channel made with this very app, and I exported all of them flawlessly in the past, but now I can't anymore. I keep getting some ""unknown error occurred"" message every time I try. I'm very upset, making stop motions was one of my favorite hobbies, but now I have to look elsewhere it seems if I want to continue."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Yep this app is great.I have up to 7 videosüò∏üòèstill working but one thingüòì you might need to know that sometimes you have to pay for the most simplest stuff.But it's good anywaysüòº"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I think this is an amazing app but when I try to load into to see my stop motions all it does is buffers it never plays I hope there is a way to fix that because like I said I love this app just hate that one flaw like I literally cannot watch any video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"IM STARTING TO HATE THIS!!! I use stop motions for horror videos and i made matipule vids and after i make a cople of them they say ""LODING...."" Every time i wach my videos! What in trying to say is you cant wach your videos after a wile. I WHANT YOU TO COMMET ON THIS STOP MOTIONS AND TELL MY WHAT MY PROBLEM OR IF I CANT FIX IT YOU FIX IT!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is good but I can't get the the photos to go through, and the app glitches."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Supa fun bru..."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it. I make dino stop motions with my dino collection."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is really effective for making stop-motion videos but has a problem. If deleted, a video can never be brought back. When i accidentally deleted my video, I couldn't get it back and i had to remake the entire thing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is amazing i like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I use it for my claymations and it soooooooo good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great just the right thing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great for beginners and professionals if you have ever watched stop motion this is what they use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is truly the best stop animation app I've used. It might be useful to know that it is not a drawing app. Otherwise, it is easy to use clay, dolls, and other props to make a nice little video! I suggest this app for all the photographers out there who need a good, free, and helpful app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bahut hi kharab app hai . Fraud hai"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good as a beginner stop motion app but I would buy the pro version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app is not resonding and there is no troubleshooting option. I've been trying to make a video, and the camera does not capture more than one image. This error has been encountered recently. I dialed in the required settings for the picture and also set a timer to automatically click the shutter, but it doesn't work. I cannot capture even a single frame."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'm a noob at stop motion but this app is making it easy to get better"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing egg (I mean it)"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worest app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think it's pretty all right if you like doing stop motions but it does lock some features behind to pay well so you want to use those then that will cost you $6 I think"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Everything is fine with it except being able to upload my YouTube videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Incredible app, i recommend if youre making stop motions on your phone."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app I use it all the time. But I don't like how it keeps recordings for 24 hours can we change it to were we can chose if we want to delete the recording"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like the app but I don't see a reason for it to have a premium version of the app when u get the same app but just a couples of added features but I dont even think they will listen but what ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I know it is bad but like lowkey cant make a stop animation app so"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Is cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its a good app for making only simple stuff because when it gets to faster stuff it just delets some frames and you cant fix it because you cant add frame in the middle the stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's so gooooooooooood!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good stop motions i have made with this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Epic game bro"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best animation app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Vary good app for stop motion it has good quality settings and sounds and 5 bucks is worth it for the pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app but I have to pay nearly for everything I have to pay for the title and the credits and I'm just a little kid so how will I get that type of money this app is wonderful though for like stop motion or recording videos but I'll leave it at five stars since it's good but why do credit and title so much money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i have a so much funny video with my brother and it was so funny how it looked me and him died in laughther."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Ivs been using for so long, but today I tried exporting my new video, and it'll only save as an audio file???"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is very nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"look i like the app but why do i need to always uninstall something just to export my films? im just trying to make films and try new things[EDIT] okay so i cleaned my phone up and got rid of what i dont need, but im planning a big stopmotion but the things i need are behind a paywall, and i font wanna install a new app just for that"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Need to unlock more stuff on this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Seems to work great! Very simple and intuitive"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I spent an hour making my first test animation. All the features worked pretty well. Then came adding the all important sound effects. But the app's sound dialogue box covers over half the screen. So you can't see what your trying to add sound effects to in real time. Ridiculous. Made the whole thing a waste of time! Plus, you can't download the app to your PC even though the description says the app is 'compatible with all my devices' and shows the icon of a pc next to a phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like this app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice App"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Just wow!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have purchased the app but it does not allow me to use the pro features. It shows an error that I have already purchased the app.. and asks me to purchase again.. and when I click on the Purchase icon it comes up with the error.. pls fix the issue.."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not free at all"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Goofy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's really good for making stop motion I recommend this but the only problem is that every like special feature cost you the pro app so your limited to a tiny amount of features that are free. But I sill highly recommend this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"If you want this app to try get your email then this is the perfect app for you"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing for filming a great qpp"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I used this a couple of times when I was an animation student. Does what it says on the box."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Criative"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool but I hate this app is cool but I hate ads and I do not like games with ads because then you can't really like enjoy it as much so get rid of your ads"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"To his is not stall in my phone .. I have problem for istallation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"AAAAAAAAAAA MY IS HACKED THIS APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everytime I try to make a video the screen stays so bright can't change it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"oky but both functions are locked"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"New video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is great! It is easy to use and fun to see your creations. For $5, you could be able to add music and use green screen! This app is good for people at all levels! Great app, really recommend it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its horrible! I bought premium then it deleted everything, including premium! Dont get thit app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Everything is alright except imported photos are reversed 180 degrees, how can i fix them. I dont want to rotate them one by one, there are 220 photos ü•≤ Help pls"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Mau import via galery aja harus bayar, pathetic"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is very good but when i make a movie it will not play most of the time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great!! I use it for my horror stop motion and they look amazing with my collection of Severed hands and that Chucky doll it looks great I made it look like there were so many dolls but please make more editing options to those who don't have premium but otherwise, this is great!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Great app for beginners if you don't want to spend money, but there is the problem with video quality, super grainy and you have to get the lighting just right for it to look any good..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"deleted all of my videos stop doing my special effects and killed my computer do NOT get this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Its mess up"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awsome stop motion app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"All together really fun to use I got the premium and it was worth it now I have many different animations and I'm very happy how good this app worked out Just add updates more"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is epic"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's ok but you run out of space fast"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I dont like that i have to pay for a better vesone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You literally have to pay for everything and I try to share it to a video editor but It didn't work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice App. I love it. Just for my Stop Motion Videos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòéüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòéüòéüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòéüëçüëçüòéüòéüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good app but there are some issues with it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This was for my youtube channel and would not go into gallerie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I don't have any ideas to make a video but I could use this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good but just one problem, idk if this is just the device im using but, EVERY PICTURE HAS DIFFERENT BRIGHTNESS. i tried getting a ton of light shining on my lego minecraft stop motion film i took forever setting up, and as the picture is getting taken the brightness changes like wth. IT RUINS THE WHOLE POINT IN THE APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"GREAT app. It makes making a Stop Motion SO easy. I just have one probelem -- Sometimes, when I record audio, I go through and watch the video later, and it has random silent parts that appear? I don't know why. Anyway, this is an overall easy-to-use app and is self explanatory. But I'd also like the option to make sound music that I use fade out into the background? I don't really like the part where I would have to just cut it off abbruptly, unless that's the thing I'm aiming for."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its good üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thanks for giving me a great childhood."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its good for stop motions but there's no point of getting this one basicly everything is premium u can't even remove the things u don't want in the motion and that was one of the reasons i got this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Of i could give half a star i would all the useful features like uploading photos cost $5"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible it won't let me upload because my Google account blocked it this is the experience ruiner as that is what I downloaded"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Eh, I think it's a bit over rated, because every thing is locked, like the title."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is fun to make stop motions, but with a lack of features, I can't do everything I want to do (without paying of course)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"AWESOME"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing like no man's business ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòò"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty nice,but sometimes it gets blurred and other times it glitches,but for the most part,its all good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"LIES"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything in this app is premium nothing is free.."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"IT's Good just when you delete it doesnt save any progress"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Why only landscape mode? Why?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This App Is propaly the best app i hace ever downloaded Great for lego, time travels, hot wheels and stuff like that. Also my brothers been hiding this app from me and just to say im happy i found it and i dunno i did tell him ""the devoper prop wants peaple to dwnload it"" so yeah good app tho. üòÑ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Really liked the app. Purchased the PRO version for the kids to use. When installed on new phone the pruchase didn't transfer and it keeps trying to charge me again. I would like the PRO version again but am not willing to repurchase everytime I change phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The app is ""okay"". There were a few things that could be changed. FIRSTLY, after recording, the speed is fast which makes one unable to see anything that has been changed. SECONDLY, once you put music in the background it doesn't save. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, when putting the background features, it takes long to download and also doesn't save. Thank you!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is the worst thing in the world you gotta pay just to do simple stuff like add pictures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"So i want to upload a stopmotion to youtube but every time i try it says thati cant and that google is blocking it and i dont know how to turn that off"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is just all around bad I don't recommend this..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sadly you can't import pics on the free version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for Lego and clay it's worth the 5 dollars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best animation app I have ever used."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Everything needs to be paid for but this is an amazing app Please make more free stuff"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app, best stop motion app that I know of. Pro is worth it if ya wanna get even better at stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Very disappointed with this. In every move it offers for you to pay. I'm sick of this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's stop motion which is coooooooooool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üòÜüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is for my channel now i never use cameras now"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice for stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Useless and frustrating. Hours of animation, and most of the clips export corrupted! Do not recommend, I'm very disappointed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Great for stop motion animation but when I try to export my movie to YouTube it blocked access"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"love this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have never downloaded any app ever this üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I used this app for many years and it brought me a lot of joy. I made my videos by taking pictures on a camera and then uploading to the computer (I had this app on the computer). Then I upgraded my computer and I find that I can only install on phones, and it is extremely hard to use on phones, and is really frustrating for someone who loved the app so much. I will love the day an app like this will be available for PC."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is awesome it has everything!! I enjoy it alot I make lego stop Motion!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its great but there's some things that need to change. There's no way to transfer your purchased item to another device. Please fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is fun and grows your imagination. I like the payed side effects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very well made, easy to navigate, and not pay-to-use. While there is a purchasable premium, it's not at all required, and every feature needed for a good stop motion is there. The premium is also very cheap."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Some Great Featured (Paid Version) I did quite a bit of stop motion animation a few year's ago, but the laptop I used to use gave up on me. My 8yr old granddaughter has recently become interested and this app gives us pretty much everything we need for a range of projects. It's lovely to see her bringing her stories to life, have fun & learn without even realising it. I'd love to see an addition to turn text into mouth shapes for lip syncing, but that probably a whole other project."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it best app to do stop motion animation trust a YouTuber channel is called grolar the polar bye"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good for what it is made for and I've used it to make some very neet stop motion film's"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Honestly great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's okay but sometimes the quality is really low so PLEASE work on that"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is very smooth"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"cool app, but what the difference between feature pack and pro version?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I would give this 5 stars but do some reason the option for manual camera settings just doesn't appear and I can't make good stop motion without the manual settings"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Spent 25 minutes while the kids destroyed the place waiting to be able to get past the glitchy remote camera app! So frustrated, I packed the whole thing up and haven't used it properly yet! This does not sync well with Apple iOS, back camera is so temperamental and barely ever works. Please fix."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"There's a problem with the newest version. The old one doesn't cut off the entire playback with the audio. Usually I scroll back and forth but everything seems out of place unless I play it from the very beginning. Even so, some of the audio kinda pauses for a split second and sounds horrible. Could you please fix this in the next update? If so, thanks!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DO NOT TRY TO UPGRADE IN APP TO PRO!!! It will not work. They will take your money, and then tell you go to Play Store. You will end up paying twice and neither company will refund one of the payments. App is okay, but I feel cheated."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good for making simple stuff, but almost everything is premium. You cant even draw stuff without buying premium. Even the plus button on the side of the screen can't be used without premium. Sometimes it taunts you by showing quick tutorials and when you try to do them, it makes you buy premium. Good app though I like to use it for making LEGO stopmotions."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good job on this work L love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best stop motion ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This is a rlly great app. I have made lots of vidoes but the audio could use some work when I played my videos all I could hear was static because the audio was terrible I hope you can make some changes. but otherwise this is a really great app and I love using it and I'll continue to use it to make more movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Petyfon iv ya like sopp modin"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Generally a good app, nice features. But I'm having trouble sending the video over to my editing app (Capcut) and it just won't send, no idea why. Smae thing is happening when I try and send my app to my camera roll or files, it just won't send. I've troubleshooted and tried everything."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its nice but it needs few improvements it sometimes dosen't save the project last time my project got corrupt and I wasn't able to open it now I have been deleated it but it would be nice if you check it once"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great but if i was going to put it as a full use without a monthly allowance or without any money It's super limited like atleast let me get stuff out of the background that would make it 5.5/5"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app is okay but the eraser tool used to be free now you just want money i could not find an app at all that had an eraser for free now I have to find other ways to get money and I'm a child"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's my favorite app on the Google play store. I love making movies"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is so coooooooool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I am a beginner, so I just want to see if I can make a short video with this app the pictures I already took. This freaking app didn't even allow me to upload the images without paying lol, crazy Uninstalled immediately, sorry. You didn't even let me try üòÇüòÇ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very fun and easy to useüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"An excellent app for video making, but it could use a lot of work. One massive issue I've had recently is the audio quality. For some reason, adding in sounds and music of my own sound awful quality-wise, and I'm not sure what changed. I've always been able to add my own stuff and it sounded just fine, but recently it has just not worked out for me. Really hope this gets fixed soon; if it does I'll return my better review"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to pay before you play/create I thought it was free :("

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Stop motion studios is a really good app. It is really good without pro but having pro makes it better. If you dont have enogh money to get pro you still get a good expirence off it. It does get laggy sometimes but i love stop motion studios. Inf/10"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app ever I can make stip motion videos for my action figs. If u are a fan of stop motion u should get the app. My rate would be 9/10 because I wish I could do green screen and erase but that costs $$$"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"There isnt anything really wrong with it but i just can't rate it five stars for some reason"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's what I use to make my lego animations and its really helpful :D"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This game is genuinely terrible at first it was amazing I was making projects for about a year now and the app suddenly deleted itself off my Samsung tablet I thought nothing of it and re installed it and 40+ hours of work is gone I am not happy unless this ""deleting itself"" gets fixed I'm leaving 1 star could do 0 if I could so I am not happy"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I love this app, I do have one little problem. Sadly I made a film with 120 slides and it wouldn't play. I am up north at my Cabin as I'm leaving a review. So possibly it's the poor wifi. But I am a little disappointed that I can't show my family. So if you fix that up, it would mean a lot to me and others having this issue. Thank you!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's so so cool and amazing esteshuly with beney boos I'm a big fan of beney boos you nede to chry them that are so cool üòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this great for making epic lego videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is very good with making stop motion videos however I do have a problem with it. I think that if more options were for free like importing images or a file from your gallery to the app, people would have more fun as it would be easier for me and other people to access."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"AMAZING üëçüòçü§©"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is a nice way to start stop motion video's"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Have to buy most of the tools to make my movies intresting. Good for silent movies with zero titles, sound, and absolutely no speech bubbles. Buy the pro version not this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i have been waiting weeks but it keeps saying pending so i do not reccomend this app it also takes up alot of space"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"When I make something more then 20 minutes it skips frames and messes up the audio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I hate it first of all you can't even export it and all the credits cost money this app sucks and I am deleting immediatly"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is awesome.But can you please add the erase feature in this app for free?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Meant for children? This Is a pay to use app and shouldn't be approved, almost everything is not free, super low quality even if said ""High definition"" Very confusing to use and expensive."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't do ANYTHING but just take photos! Everything costs money, I'm not allowed to draw unless I pay. Everything is locked until you buy it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love making stopmotions"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I really like this app it is very good for recording stop motion videos but one thing I would like you to do Is ban the Google use called A GOOGLE user he is spamming reviews like crazy so yea there is nothing bad with the app it's just the reviews aren't accurate."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is so fun i have fun playing on it no problems yet"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is the best Stop motion app that I have ever used. You dont even need the extra features that this app offers, when i downloaded this app for the first time It was so easy to use and super easy to start out with doing any kind of stop motion. All you need is a tablet or phone (it can be outdated), any stop motion app, and some clay, legos, etc. I have had no problems with this app, although I havent exported any videos yet, I will figure out how to get the videos to my computer."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"One star because every single little edit that you want to do you have to pay $5 a month just to have drawing and sounds and what it exports to places it doesn't even export it goes straight back to animated app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is great! But I have a suggestion for me and some people who did this as well, can you make a feature where lost movies can be restored? Because I accidentally deleted the app while cleaning out my storage and I was working on nascar, for like an hour and poof! It's gone and I forgot to save it. If you would kindly add that feature, it would be appreciated. Thanks."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very creative!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best apps for stop motion üëçüèº.But I stay wait the new update in 2022 üòî."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why just why. I can't even upload videos because this app tries to get google account details what a scam delete the app. |:("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's tricky to control, and the final videos are blurry."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it sucks i hit allow and it will not let me use it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Won't let me upload this so I can't give it 5 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Cost"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a decent movie maker. The only problems I have are with the sounds and the fact that theres no delete button. There aren't many sounds and when I tried to record my voice. It didn't work and cut half of my recording. But all in all, this is high quality."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great! you can erase about anything."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It cost money to do stuff"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Y√≥uhave to pay to add photos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app for lego animation but premier verson is best than this alots of graphics"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really fun. My teacher used this once even to"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Could use a ton more features like being able to draw on them because the front picture would have given the wrong idea and needs a way to export the videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice appsü•∞"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"A great app, but ever since yesterday any new movie i made wouldn't load at all, i eventually deleted and reinstalled the app but all that did was delete all my movies. Please fix!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This sucks. First, none of my projects would play. I tried everything to make it work, but it didn't. I backed them all up and deleted and reinstalled the app. I imported my projects, and tons of frames are missing. All of my projects gone, over one stupid glitch. All of that time spent filming, wasted."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"üëç it work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I cant even fricing download it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"great app me and my family makes funny vidieos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I would only recommend this for people who are willing to spend money. Without money there's a limited selection. No sound effects, no music abs no intro. Only video and photo importer."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good, it worked really when I made a giant movie but when I finished all the pictures got deleted with the text ""Media not found"" and a giant question mark over where the pictures should have been. It works well but I have mixed fellings now that my hard work was deleted. If anyone knows how to get the files back please reply."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It has downloaded perfectly."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is terrible for stop motion anamating. It does not have like a clearish cover when using camera of previous frame. There is no way to tell where the objects should be if my phone gets moved or bumped. It keeps asking me to pay for pro and there is no way to tell it to stop asking you. I really don't want to pay for pro and to get almost all features you have to pay for pro. It takes forever to upload videos if they have a lot of frames and sometimes it doesn't even upload. It a bad app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I love this app but the reason I rated it a three star was because I can't add backgrounds just because I didn't buy the premium! Second was 50 percent of the editing tools are premium. 2 years ago I used it. And now that I am older I want to make it more higher qualoty so please fix it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing to use. I made multiple of lego films and they look so cool. Perfect app for animation videos. üòä"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Importing photos is paid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a great app I am having fun with it by putting in My YouTube channel called Flurypury. We bought the editing parts so we could put I audio and specially effects. The only problem with some of the audio it is some thing like the dinosaurs don't sound like dinosaurs at all, but at least you can make your own dinosaur sounds by recording it which is cool this app is good for creative minds."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"When I first got this app it was amazing and I can post on to YouTube but then sometime later google had to block the app all because they said the app tried to access sensitive info and I don know what to do"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"great app, but I wish I didn't have to pay to add files/images for the scenes."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"esta aplicacion es muy buena 5"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's a very good aap I like it but please make a updat on this aap üôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§î"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Done so many great things from this app for marketing purpose. üòÅüëçüëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"My app didn't come with manual mode setting in either the free or paided version. For a photograph based application it is 100% essential. It's listed as a feature. Custom support was not helpful at all. Very disappointing experience overall."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"There is not voice feature to take shots. That makes self stop motion impossible, and stop motion video may be shaky."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I learn more about animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"IM I A JOKE TO YOU?! I litterly can't send any project for my YT like seriously what's this Trash People said too its trash but for other reasons it horrible"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very good. If you have any large files it may lag"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything you have to buy! üò° I installed the app because I thought I would get to have fun and not buy anything. Please have it so at least the background\green screen is free!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good. But kinda limeted. It requires that you buy pro for the cool stuff."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Very good but i got a new phone and it erased all my old stop motions which really made me feel bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Dont use it the creator of the app is dumb and should not exist"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I would give this zero stars of I could. No way to do voiceovers, slow down speed, or do anything really cool. DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to pay. Its not free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Alright,not the best. Cant export well, it is so buggy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great goated simple it helps a lot plus great"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best app to start stop motion for beginners.üòÄüòç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This maybe fun to use but I didn't that everyone has to pay $4.99 for inserting background picture from your gallery app and that's why I can't make my own stop motion videos and I wanted to make a YouTube video with it and I'll find something else to make my own stop motion videos on YouTube or post it on TikTok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why does it not let me sign in pls fix the ishu i will come back if i rebember to download it pls PLS update"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's super fun and recommend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but the audio when I record it sounds awful And the green screen shouldn't cost money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Is the worst I don't even understand it I'm guessing it one star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"We can't even use this app as the add for the pro version pops up and we can't close it. Absolutely useless! We will be uninstalling this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You can't move back slides or rearrange them. There are other stop motion apps that offer more to it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Superb app, I am making stop motion movies with this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"For the longest time I thought I had bad camera quality but I've realized my pictures become extremely blurry when Im playing the video but when its not being played, the pictures look crystal clear."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love stop motion studios it's so easy to work with and 0 adds not too many bugs as well. I love to get clay and just start editing my movies or making new movies. This is a great app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Disgusting........"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I would rate 10/10 who makes progress between each animation you make and it shows how much progress you make each stop motion like your first one to your last one it was so progress"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I don't even know what to say, stop motion is one of my favorite things to do. It's fun to make videos, and it's fun to watch the videos to. I'm so glad I found stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a great stop motion app until there's something wrong.While making my stop motion,there's a bug where you can't see the stop motion video.so all of my work for NOTHING. And if you think you can upload a bugged video.You can't and instead,They give you an error that can't be fixed. So many bugs and errors that haven't been for almost a year. AWFUL.not recommend for stop motion fans"

And i hope your company will be the smalles company forever and banned you company and i hope all of you die if you don't remove it i will give you 1 years to fix it if you don't i will curse you all."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is AWSOME it is the best app for animation without having to do all the complicated stuff. I also like how it comes with its own editor and you don‚Äôt need an extra app to do it for you. My only complaint is that I wish it had a larger and better sound track."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You can't quite do everything on this app because all the backgrounds and titles and everything is on a seperate subscription. However, it does allow you to do some photos and put it all together to make a movie. It isn't the best stop motion app out there and there are other apps like this that you don't have to pay a subscription to have the backgrounds and the text. There is one more thing that I have to say which is I like the short video to get you started. =)"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like the app but the only issue is the audio. For instance I want to put in something so that my animation isn't boring but I have to pay and for some people they can't pay for certain things that they want to use.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really useful to make stop motions..."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good for beginners to use. Cheap dlc. I did some stop motion. Just check out godzilla vs warpath. I did that."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I've used the premium version on our tablet wich was fine, only it was low on storage so I installed the non-premium one on my phone and it doesn't allow you to add text music and more, pretty poor to be honest wouldn't recommend installing this one but premium is OK except its a bit expensive, but ti's probably the best one if you're a serious stopmotioner.

But I really didn't like how to imput your own green screen backrounds you had to buy it. I mean it's so DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMB! If you want people to actully use this to it's full potential you better put only the things that appsolutely need to be bought. Also, YOU LIEDD!!!!!!! About it being at a low price. 5 DOLLARS IS NOT LOW!!! So if yor're planning on using thi app don't get your hopes upp onAREALLYGOODMOOV."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Fuzzy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Stop motion is a really good app in my opinion. I've had it for a week now and I've made several animations using stop motion. You can make animations by taking photos, it is also good for making videos so I'll give it a 5‚òÜ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"There are no words to describe the pain I'm in right now with this app. All I can say is make the Samsung version identical to the apple one. Pinch zoom. Full zoom. Extra features, everything. Yes I have pro. Every day I learn a thing samsung dosnt get. And it makes me regret getting a samsung just because of this app. I've tried so hard and I almost want to give up. Update your dang app cateator, theres nothing I can do. But hope you listen."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Made a stop motion video within 5 minutes of opening the app. It will never win any awards but I'm amazed at how easy it is to make a good stop motion video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app is easy to use but there are too many premium things. I wasted 1 hour on this app just to see that I can't import/download the video. Please fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst app I can't even acess my files for free üò°"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Easy to use..Good apps for making stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's very good, but I recommend pro because it's easier and has much more stuff."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Once downloaded my movies will not load at all"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good, but doesn't save movies if you offload the app, unless you post them online."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and basically perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Hi. I have been using this app for over 3 years now and it's great overall with a few bugs here and there but this one problem has came up that the green screen just overlays on EVERYTHING even though it should only appear on green objects. This is extremely annoying and I hope you fix this soon as this has made me lose interest in the pro version for awhile now."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's good for some time but then it asks you to charge"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I need to pay money for everything not fair. Made by poopoo beggers üí©üí©."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"OK you can't sand it to youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"If I could give it 0 stars I would, but this is as close as I can get. When I try playing one of my movies the whole thing just takes 50 minutes to load. I tried deleting pictures but then that didn't work, I can't even do the free voice acting. Do not install."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing I never found an app better then this one"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The stop motions are good but I had to buy a new phone because I got the app and after I did my phone couldn't charge anymore and it took all of my space."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I don't know how to save it and it is literally impossible to take the picture in the right place"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Well, I was gonna use this, but the thing is, I had already made one earlier. I only needed to make it a ""video""-but I couldn't add my pictures. So I didn't use it. Besides that, it's great!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Omg this is the keeey!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is good to do things but it has to many adds so I would give it five but it was just the adds so three it is."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"What's the difference between in-app purchase of this and the stop motion pro version? I should have bought the pro version of this, instead of paying the same price but not pro version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's bad. It asked for my opinion for the app to access my photos. I pressed only using this app. And I click cancel on the payment. And it wouldn't go away. It sucked."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"fun app but could not do alot of things with out pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Literally amazing. I can do stopmotions super easily and adjust the speed. Animation is doable still without premium which I appreciate. Love it!üëçüíñ"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its really fun to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome for making your own videos if you don't want to show your hands . Almost better than video games. End of story"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You can't use already taken photos. What's the point?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's fun and all I use it for Lego and dolls(I'm 11)you have to pay though kinda Annoying...but makes awesome movies hope you enjoy the app."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app its very helpful for me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very nice animation making app...but everything i wanted to add its not free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Why is it that you have to pay for drawing effect and other stuff and in uss"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app is so good my son makes stop motion stuff all day :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Says it's free but it's actually paid. Stop motion = being able to add your own pictures. The app conveniently waits until you've downloaded it to let you know that adding pictures from your own gallery is a paid feature. Absolute waste of my time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Has worked seamlessly for over a year yet now its glitching I can't play any of the animations I have created I got the stop motion Pro app and its not working aswell but apart from this its a great app could do with a few more sound effects"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good quality and fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"you need to pay for alot of things you can't erase without paying for it which is the most needed for a stop motion and before downloading the i made alot of photos just to find out you have to pay for. using them 0 stars i would do but i have to choose at least one change it! lowest rating i ever gave"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is cool but just 1 issue... I can't export my project I tried everything like Hold on the project thumbnail>Share>Export Movie>Save as And when I checked on the gallery, there was nothing! And Kinemaster says it's an unsupported file format.. Cateater, pls fix this issue.. it's really buggy.."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Really would be good if you didn't have to pay for almost everything."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love this app and I love to read the comments like the one where she gave 1 star because they didn't have here video a YEAR later I think Facebook is like that too I don't think that the program keeps your stuff for a NON ACTIVE person"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good, but one time I had the Uninstall and install again so I can stop a blurry camera"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Day 3 it's still not downloaded bru"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"In response to the review about the app deleting videos: you need to save them from the app to your phone or other storage. This is done from the main screen. If you don't do that, they will disappear if you freed up space on your phone recently, which sounds like might have happened."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Es muy simple de usar para lograr algo r√°pidamente."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. I did my first stop motion animation a about 20 years ago and have a degree in this field. This program does everything you need to make a stopmotion animation. It gives you the option to change the frame rate and has onion skin layers, so its perfect for any budding animator. The negitive reviews are directed at the ¬£4.50 you will have to spend to unlock 4k and some novelty backgounds. We can't expect these developers to create programs for free...so ¬£4.50 is peanuts !"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Was a good app, got the $5 extension a while ago and re installed it today and I don't even have it anymore and it wants me to pay again."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it so much it do cool!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great fun to make Lego stop motion videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"If you are bored then use this appüòÅ,I have been using this from a month and it's great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app. I have it on ipad too. I wish it has feature parity with ansroid For example, on old ipad the focus slider work smoothly and changes live, while here on my s20 the focus slider seems not to work at all.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Thought this was a good app, worked well enough to make a number of stop motion videos with the kids last year. Go to look at the videos today, only to realize they're all gone! Why would an app delete all my videos?! Time to delete the app!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It's great for beginners."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"After using for a few minutes and find out all the good things are locked behind a pay wall. Can't record audio. No built in background. If you just want to take pictures and do stop motion that way there are far better free options. Especially if you have access to a PC"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"IT...WAS...AWESOME"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I will give 1 star this app because my videos have no edits because all edits have to be paid very ugly by this appüò°"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a great app I love animating with photos but the only problem is that you can use photos from your camera roll. If you want an app that let's you add photos from your camera roll I recommend Capcut. Bye I hope this review is helpful!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is easy to make a Lego video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The reason I give one star is because you have to pay 5 euros to use it and film things. So bad in my opinion."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I really like this app but you have to have nothing but time to make these mini movies but it is a fun app and there is almost no adds as long as I played the game to put in prespect 30 minutes of moving objects and non stop camra clicking is about a 1 minute of a mini movie but that 1 minute is very enjoying if you did a good job on the movie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good because it's better than other stop motion apps that I've tried in the past.Although there is a pay wall to get better tools but, I do think it's still cool if you want to do a quick stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Love the app I hope you can make green screen free plz I love the app so much plz do it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a great stop motion app I use it for my figures and it looks great!

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"ive been searching for a while to find the perfect stop motion app. ithis app is so simple!! but really, who wants to pay 5 bucks for something that is on all other editin apps for free lol"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Works pretty well as a free stop motion app. It lacks all the complicated features that professional stop motion uses. I needed it for a project at school, but now that I'm finished, this app isn't sophisticated enough to keep."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was nice but did find a few errors for my students"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not free. Have to pay $5 to import images"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This stupid program only let's you do TEN FRAMES of film."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its brilliant. Easy to use, clear and practical! I wish it had more backgrounds without paying however."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything is for money!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good! Please insert portrait videos feature! It will be great."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's very great I love it. But I don't like how you have to buy it to get the editing options."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it because I can create my own story's!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Dear Sir Or Madam im writing this letter as this is one of my favourite apps, but now i have ran into an issue which is making me very sad and confused. The issue is i have a great time with the app, but then im finished using it, so i close the app,(i have non-premium version)i have ads on the app, but the ads now somehow also come on the home screen, thats the problem, this app without permission uses it's ads on the home screen! im hoping for a quick reply now, thank you. your downloader,"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"No masking, or vfx in the free version. But good app for beginners. Odd glitch where some of the frames turn blue for me."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The fil s would occasionally delete itself when I wouldn't even touch it. So much time and effort lost."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"UwU"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When I downloaded this app Google told me this, ""we have blocked the app because it was trying to find sensitive information that the creators should not know."" When I read this I was shocked. I deleted the app as fast as I can. DOWNLOAD THIS APP AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't really do much without paying, 90 percent sure that it has 10mil downloads because of school ipads"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app super easy to use and fun, I would recommend to use it for school projects or just for fun as it isn't best quality unless you purchase pro.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but I cant figure out how to upload my video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I loved it! maybe you can add a free title and credit screen because you have to pay for most stuff. It is really easy to use. Make a few things free at least."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"App is great over all but I just hope the premium stuff were free because they were VERY crucial to most stop motion projects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app and everything is amazing except the green screen being a little glitchy, but the reason I'm putting 4 instead of 5 stars is because I have a problem with it, I bought the pro version through this app and it was amazing but here recently I've had to change phones and when I transferred everything over to my new phone for some reason it tells me that I haven't bought the pro version even though I have and I've tried everything to fix this so I would like this fixed or my moneyback"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn, easy to use, and so much fun."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Once you add the $5 upgrade option, this app is sly!!! Love it!!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Idk why u have to pay to write text but I hate that and its annoying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good app! I have had so much fun making little funny animations 10/10 app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I sprung some money for the paid version. Its pretty good. Though i suggest a more high end pro version ...maybe in the region of $20 to give even more studio and pro editing features. The $5 version understandably is limited in terms of offering."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"‡¶π‡ßá‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶™‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"You can use easily and make fun but I there is 1 thing i dont like and it's when mess up and you dont know where your were at. Plus: I use this for doll stop motion and it turned out good but sometimes it can look blurry Ps:I'm only 9 but started when was 8 so I think if your under 7 you might need someone who is older to help and when it's your first try I suggest you have help or watch a tutorial online. Overall it's great definitly recommend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"pog"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very bad user experience"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a good app except for the fact that almost every feature in the app requires the pro version."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"All the good things cost money like the eraser"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"We have been trying this app for 2 days and almost all is great and simple. But today, after I paid the unrestricted version, I found out there is an issue with sound effects. Both sound effects and recorded audio added don't sound well ... we added e.g. 2 second long Race car effects and in video, it skips like 0.2 seconds of that effect in the middle. It is very annoying. I will try some restarts, reinstalls etc. and if it stays like this, I will refund my money back"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You literally have to get premium to do anything on it. Please sort that out"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Can you please add free Lego Ninjago sound"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I liked it but I did get very blurry and I had to keep tapping it but otherwise it was good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"the filming experience is fun, and easy to use for someone like me, however I wish more of the editing options were usable without premium. Still that's only a nitpick."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Hi I'm Angela's daughter and I'm mad when I play the stop motion it's playing to fast and I can't slow it down please fix and I will rate you five stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"in da goody mart"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it's a really good app for its price,the only issue I have with it is the fact that U can't edit it much like if it holding a Lego person with blutack and U want to get rid of it but otherwise it's good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've done something like this in year 5 and yet I'm a pro and I want to show people on YouTube my video and yet I'm a pro on stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I just love this app there is nothing wrong with it but if there is for you i dont know whats happning with you phone,ipab ect but this app is a good one."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Stop Motion Studio is really great for a free app. One minor issue I have with the app is that sometimes when I'm playing an animation with a voice over I added, it tends to cut out a tiny bit of the audio, which sounds annoying. Other than that, it's a really great app for making animations for free!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app sucks I need to buy the premium to upload a file"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Coooooooool"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Why does android not have a manual mode?? Why would you limit it only for ios users?? What's the point??"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Only Horrible can describe the dysfunctional limitations and utterly Uselessness of this app. Google photos does better than this junk. If y]ou are going to make an animation app please research the topic a little more and note it takes more than ten pictures to create any thing more than a one second animation. How about not limiting it ten. You must have found the code to write this app in a cracker jack box. What a joke"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I have to buy everything to make it cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've made some pretty cool stop motions but what's keeping me from rating a 5 star is that you can't zoom on the camera. Idk why you can't but right now I can't get close ups because my camera can't focus, but if I could zoom, then I would have focus. So please just add a zooming in feature, that would complete this app for me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Fine"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Lol I'm bad at Stop motion XD"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I enjoy it a lot. It's made a lot of stopmotions for me and it's even helped me make a school project!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is a pretty good app. It just depends on what device you record on, because the quality is different. But all on all this app is really good!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very easy to use but whenever I try to open an old movie of mine, what shows up is a black screen for exactly a second. Why?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"so easy to use <3"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"How do you save??"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is great but my only problem is that you can't zoom in"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"stop motion studio pro is blocked cuz it harmful in device üò†üò†"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its a pretty good recording app ive seen better apps but i still use this one idk why but i do, i use this app to do lego stop motion it does a very good job!

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it you can make videos with the appüòÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER! üòçüòçüòç 10000 STARS"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't use it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"First of all, there is a huge quality issue and it has terrible resolution. The zoom feature is different because now you have to open up the movie settings and change it, whereas, before you could literally zoom with your fingers. It now also will focus automatically and change the lighting, which makes your stop motion look choppy. I honestly don't understand why I'm writing this review, because the developers don't respond to suggestions or change anything. I would not recommend to anyone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It always want you to go into Premium to add music."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app I would recommend playing this a specially with a brother or sister"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I will change the review if its works well"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It looks awesome but it's just a little bit too hard to play üôÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wow I was so excited to see This!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The app is great, but the options are limited, and I couldn't find a way to add in effects. Also, please fix the audio. Half the time it doesn't play, and when it does, it's at the wrong time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"One star because I can't really use it. Everytime I set up a scene, it resets every time I leave and then get back on, sometimes it just suddenly resets, and yes I'm using manual mode. I can't figure out what's wrong."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"THIS APP ALWAYS WANTS MONEY TO ADD OTHER EFFECTS AND STUFF!!!!! THAT'S WHY IT GETS 1 STAR! FIX THIS, THEN IT WILL GET 5 STARS!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love doing stop motion"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This game is cool I don't care what other people think"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Because you have to buy the stuff and that's not free"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Good app, although minus one star for not being able to add/import custom images to the ending credits in movies (even when images CAN be added/imported to other parts of movies, which makes it even more puzzling?!), and minus another star for not being able to fade in/fade out audio that is added from imported audio files (only cutting it off abruptly is possible). Please fix this and it will be five stars!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"What's the difference between this one and the Pro?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice first"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Having to get pro for sounds? no thanks i'll stick to kinemaster for sounds Oh, whats this? pro for greenscreen? Nah kinemaster really its limited for normal version other than that, its good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I already bought the pro version but why I still have this version though all features are unlocked, but how can I get the pro version? I can't see my purchase on my email..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I was reafing through the critical rewiews and people are saying they cant pur text or anything on the videos it costs $4 all you need to do to fix that is download capcut and expirt the stopmotion onto your own camera roll open capvut and u can edit it however you want! In my opionion this is a great app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Have to pay for lots."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"**READ THIS REVIEW** This review is based off of the facts of this app. This app is very easy to use after you get the hang of it. This app is awesome and worth every cent for the paid version. Most people don't understand the effort put into this awesome app, and give it a one star because they don't want to pay for the extra features. Most people that give it 1-3 stars don't know how to use this app at all. This app is the best stop motion app on any app store. I definitely recommend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëåüÜíÔ∏è great game. Totally recommend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love this app it works amazing üëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a amazing app to use for stopmotions and there's no adds for me and you can use green screen and it works perfectly, you should download this app and I've posted stopmotions from this app to YouTube, AMAZING APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like this App a lot but I just hate how you have to pay for the better stuff"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is so good. But plz try to add eraser in free version of this app...."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Can you make the backrounds and text free and the walking animation please but this game is good 4-1"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great! This is how I kickstarted my YouTube channel"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is great. Very easy to use, but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I've recently had a really bad issue with this app. For a while, I could make stop motions as long as I wanted, until recently, where now, if I make a stop motion more than 200 frames, it just will not load when I go to play the stop motion. So, that's why this gets 2 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really good but if you want to add some of your custom audio files it's 5 bucks. Overall really good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This website is awesome. Everything is good and yeah. I do reccomend it. I've make 30 stopmotion videos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great I tried it and it's so cool you should give it a go I would like like if you could have more features without the pro version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, no nit picks from me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good and fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It was good at taking photos but there were no gun sound affects which I needed for my war stop motion and u can't add any stickers by which I mean no muzzle flare no explosions etc."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is great its so easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Ok it walks but sometimes"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I only wish we could set the brightness and focus entirely manually. I want to adjust my environment to constant camera settings, I don't want the camera to adjust itself to the environment I made for it EDIT: WE CAN, It's just a bit hidden"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It gets stuck if I have a long stop motion video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I really like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Every thing is awesome in this but I have rated 4 for 5 because it asks evry thing for money üí∞ and I can afford that much for animating silli things so that it's only fit for money payers but it still good to have it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's so good, I highly recommend it if you're a beginner animater. It's easy to use and gives good results. I think you should get the 5$ upgrade, because it's cheap and gives a ton of features."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"App is beautiful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Well I like the app it is very usefull and handy for making stop motion buy there are some sound effects that I do not like ESPECIALLY THE PUNCH instead of a punsh it does a whoosh I HATE THIS please fix it üò°üò†üò†"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I made some lego videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it's honestly great however the fact that people have to pay 5 pounds just to edit your own work makes worthy of one star, editing is something that people can now do on their galleries for FREE why are you charging us for?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this stop motion studio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"its amzing oly reason why its 4 stars instead of 5 is because it isnt very clear on how to export your videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's really useful in all ways"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Realy i like this app i want to say one only thanks for give this app i play store and many app to downlad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Cool App for making Stop Motion videos! The collection of backgrounds, foregrounds/frames, sound clips are good. Overall, very easy to use. Choosing 4 start for a reason - The tutorial describes that, image can be imported inside frame/image editor. But I am not seeing it even after upgrading :( Please add this feature (adding more images along with texts, shapes etc. in a frame). I'm ready to pay $10 more for this üôè."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The only and the main disadvantage is, you have to pay to make a video with pre-clicked pictures from gallery üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best app i made some plushie ones"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's so much fun to make stop motion movies! The plus version is a good deal for All the extra stuff for life."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So awesome for filming"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Why should I have to pay to do what I love"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Was really excited to use this till I opened it and basically it wanted money to do anything. I understand developing apps costs money but I'm not paying for what doesn't work. Thank you reviews."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVE MAKING STOP MOTION MOVIES I JUST MADE ONE!!!üòäüòÄ thanks for this game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"If you're searching for a good app for stop motion then I suggest you stop here. This is the best one I've seen so far and it provides great capabilities for animating. While there could be quite a few improvements to be suggested, such as giving an actual lip sync option, (like the one in flipaclip), I think you should definitely check it out."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"ITS THE WORST 115.00 JUST TO DRAW ON IT"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"One of the best stop motion apps I have ever used, I wish I knew how to get rid of the background and hide props holding up the characters and how to animate the characters face's to show expressions. But I am glad that there was no ad's in this app really helpful."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"To much money I wish it was all free but I done a project with it for school and I got a 100 and I like the"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I worked very hard on a Lego Minecraft video, but afterwards it refused to load. I have to manually scroll through my videos. Does anyone know how to fix this?"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Simple, clean interface"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Amazing app. Right up until you try to edit it in any way at all. you have to pay for the features IN THE VIDEO which doesnt even tell you that you need to pay for the features. Oh and you cant even export But atleast that makes sense because if you could export you wouldnt need to pay to edit a stop motion Just stick to using your phones camera because atleast you dont have to pay for that."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"They could have given you more or removed the random adds otherwise it's a good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'm James I'm 9 years old I'm so so happy for this my friend say with me I'm pro on stop motions"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"For a basic feature like adding images, if you are asking for paid membership, then you better put this app on paid section. Telling people it's free and a basic feature costs, that's a lie."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Alright..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It so awesome I think every one should have this amazing it's magic"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is so good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good just there is a bug where some frames turn black but this app is really good for animations 9/10"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Pretty lame that you have to pay to add images"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SAVE THE VIDEO I do NOT recommend. Horrible."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best app ever cuz you can do stop motion the only one problem you have to get to pay and credits and theme to have to pay like $4.99 and that's how much you have to pay for for the stop motion down to do it in credits"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its stop motion i guess"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Can you do it an update in this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this application, it's really good for stop motion (the best one there is) but I have it 4 stars instead of 5 because they should really make each user create an account. I have changed phones twice and every time I download this app I can't find my old work from previous devices, which makes it really annoying. So I strongly recommend to the makers of this app to make each user create their own account"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Man I thought this was the most best stop motion creator until I wanted to put an explosion sound effect to my cannon but no... It said u had to pay $5 for everything!?! I was so mad at this why can't it be free? I mean come on no one wants to pay money if things were, then maybe more people would be installing this app... So plz make it free..."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I hate the fact I have to pay to erase stuff I don't want in my videos. If this wasn't the case, I would be happy with the app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This stop motion app was easy to use and great to make videos with until awhile ago. Now each respective picture comes out as either really dark or really light so when you play the video it looks like someone is flashing a light on and off in the background. It is very inconvenient and is the biggest reason I no longer use this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I use it all the time but when I want to use sound effects and the music you have to pay everything and it's soooooooo annoying I do like how I can use it without wifi but please fix this problem but anyway what a good app to use(‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good easy to use I already made muitible videos without a trouble"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is just perfect for Lego stop motion but the only problem is you need to buy the features and I know that they want to make money and some times life is hard without money so keep it up guys maybe one day you will create a new best app for stop motion don't loose hope üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Deez buys of the studio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I got this for my son to use. He likes making stop-motion Lego movies. He's 8, and he can use it pretty independently. It's very user friendly and simple. Works on Galaxy S8 with no problem. I have it on my S21 but haven't used it yet. The app comes with a small collection of sound effects and music which is fun to use. You can record your own sounds too. Fun app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I'll give it 3 stars if it's sure or works"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I have bought the thing were you get more features but now it doesn't let me do the stuff I bought I am a YOUTUBER and this doesn't help me please fix this great app though"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its awesome. Kids enjoy it and I love it. I rate it a 5"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"A brilliant app but currently the manual focus function does not work for me. Everything is set at the closest focus level and despite changing the focus value, it remains the same."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is a amazing app get it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app and if like Transformers go on my channel called Transformer Master"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Be Warned ‚ö†Ô∏è it all depends on what type of camera u have. If it has good resolution quality then your videos will come out amazing. Lower camera quality then not so good videos. My only complaint is u can't really do long videos because it will lag. That can be fixed if you use higher fps besides that amazing app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't even import images. That's such an important thing and it's a premium feature. Such greedieness."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like The app its Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"We cant do anything in this without paying money. it is useless without those options . We cant even make stop motion without those options"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I love the app but the only thing i hate about this app is that you need to pay"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best mobile stop motion app. I use it just to create a video and then I edit it on the pc. Well, i paid to unlock the export feature but it's very cheap."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is very nice...But Pls remove all paid versions to free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I gave 3 stars cause I wanted to add pictures and that's why I downloaded this app as it is not allowing me to maybe you could only open that one feature"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love using this gor my stop motion videos. Ive done so many amazing things with this app and the coupple bucks to acess everything is totlay worth it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Overall, really great. I have been making NASCAR Stop Motion Races on YouTube and noticed that the frame rate was uneven. Also, I would like a feature where I can make certain parts of the movie a different frame rate than the rest."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"As of July 2021 there is a bug where you export something and it just won't export, it will appear in the files but you can view it or anything, it's very annoying and you have to clear storage and cache to Download then do it again please fix this bug as I'm a YouTuber and this makes my schedule even more hell"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think this app is decent, sure the paid version is better but if you don't wanna spend ¬£5 on it, then this is a good alternative. I've been able to make a lot of good stop motions on it. But my one problem is the audio. You have to pay for preset audio, I mean you can record audio but it's a bit more limiting for sounds, like a car."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It help me make video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helped me do something I've once dreamed about doing and that's stop motion. Thank you, Stop Motion Studios."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app so much great performance great stuff but u can only rtake pics and add sound like mic to just even add sound effects you need to pay for stupid things mabye make the audio files or others instead of making it for money I fell like the people who made this only want money we need an update."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the Best app for STOP MOTION I love this app.. I don't know why ppl rate it 3 or 2 I mean like Famous ytbers Use this app All the Best to this app we are with you..üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Overall the app is good but the export time takes too long or something times the file gets lost. Other than that it's fine."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Im amazed"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"nice app to make video and share your video and we can do your own video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's good I have made cartoons for my company"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very very very good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for my YouTube channel and it great! TheAwesomeKingLink is my YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing app I use it all the time and I am inlove with it Though i has one request If you were to add a video from your gallery the audio doesn't follow through aswell Please please PLEASE add this as for so many stop motions I have wanted to due I have been restricted due to not being able to use audio from my gallery"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is only ok, and that's it. You cant make very long videos using this because it becomes too laggy. You also sometimes can't play your short video back and all that will show is a flashing bar that won't load and after it becomes repetitive, it becomes frustrating. Even when I restarted my phone, the app still didn't work properly. My other complaint is adding sound effects. You can only add a voice recording for free, the other stuff has to be paid for. Good for beginners, that's all."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is fun and easy also it can be funny when you watch it over if there is eny mistakes you will never be bored üòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It went moo"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"IT'S SO COOL MY SON USES IT ALL THE TIME."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the best stop motion app but stop motion pro is much better and expensive many of the good features are in stop motion pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I don't like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like its animations so mush l like it very much"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Need to by it not a great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Please work on the focusing and it needs to be more I like the I can animate app were you can see the previous picture while taking pics"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love stop motion studio! This app is very easy to edit with and great for beginners. The upgraded version is definitely worth the price. It has many different features and is worth the $5. I mean you're not going to lose those features. The normal version kinda sucks."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's really great for plain stop motions, but there are too many in app purchases and today i added onto a stopmotion and I couldent watch it or do anything besides taking pictures."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"They should make the extras like credits free and more people will keep the app. Other than that five stars I love making long films!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The stop motion app is a very good app to make toy videos without using your hands."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"TRASH GARBAGE USELESS GIT GUD KID HA HA HA"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"In order to use this app, you have to BUY PRO! You can do ABSOLUTELY nothing without it. At least make some features available to free users other than being able to take photos!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Just wanna start to insert image. And need to pay. Waste of time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The free version is fun and just perfect, but the upgrade option inside the application, worth it!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really really nice app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app but how do I export videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cannot import photos in the free version. Pointless. Uninstall straight away."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is great I figure out how to use it but I wish stop motion pro was free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"VERY GOOD. But has a big thing that lowered me 4 stars. And it is payments. I absolutely have them."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't use my own pictures it just wants me to pay I would rather use Inshot"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great, even without the prenium futures it still make a great movie"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Do B"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is completely useless, trust me. Whenever I replay my lego stop motion videos it just keeps buffereing. The same problem goes with inserting audio downloads. It works for the first 70 frames then it just stops working. This app really knows how to WASTE your hardworking skill, time and patience."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's fun and all but there's only two things that are wrong with it first of all I don't want to pay money and second of all can you please add a YouTube button so you can actually put it on YouTube and you can post it to YouTube you know what I mean so yeah that's what I want to do with this app instead of paying money and not putting it on to YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Dude I ain't paying $5 just to import a photo."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool you can make stop motion use it now"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I teach kids stop motion using this app. The free version isn't riddled with adds and allows you to create a great stop motion from start to finish. The upgrade is only really required if you wanted to get a little more serious. And they seem to have a bunch of great new features!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a good app but not the best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing! I make mega construx stop motions for my YouTube channel - PaperClip Studios I brought the pro upgrade and its amazing! Only problem, no visual effects! That would really help as I'm on android so I can't use imovie."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I had to use this for my art class. The experience is better on IOS than android. The camera keeps reseting and never focuses, most the time blurry.

Out of all the stop motion apps I installed this one is the best."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app is so good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"In the middle of animating when played it was a bit slow and choppy, but fortunately when Importing it worked fine and the video wasn't bad."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cheating. I paid money but not yet updated to pro."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Now it is a good app ive made some cool stuff with it, i just have one question, WHY DOES MY STUFF DELETE EVERYTIME I SHUT MY PHONE OFF. (Like full shut off) It never saves my work and i just loose 15 hours of work.... Explain this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing. This is on levels of professonal stop motions."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable, IT DOESNT LET ME INSTALL! üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The reason why I only gave us a four-star review because well first of all I really like the app second of all I bought the green screen when everything was $1 and now since they updated it I have to buy it again"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When i want to make movie and when i create a new movie the camera does not work but my camera is good u need to fix this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"How come every time I have a song in the video, it cuts out after 30 seconds?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I dident download for 20 minutes but when it did It always was on an add"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I like the features and all but when its time to export the movie, it suddenly crashes... so all the work Ive done is futile"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it because it makes a object move and storytime and movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I bet this is a great app, but the fact that I have to pay in order to import my own images that I already took to make a movie is a little frustrating. I took over 400 Pictures for a class of mine and I can't import any of them because I don't have that money. (I'm a high schooler.) However, the options seem nice so I'm sure the people that can buy it love the app and can make amazing things."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cuz,it is üòé cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"If i put the camera in manual mode i can not take picture anymore! how to fix this? i bought the full version of it but i am very disappointed! i need the camera to be manual so it wont auto focus!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"üí© poop"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't export my movie. Says it doest recognize file format."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Terrible, u have to buy legit EVERYTHING to actuallake a good animation. Remote picture BUY good camera work BUY audio BUY half of the option for a frame BUY u have to but everything to do a good animation, dont get it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing app great for starters, the only down part for the starter is you have to pay 4.99$ at least its not higher ‚ò∫. For me I only made 3 movies and I don't have any more space but maybe that's just me. But overall its a very great app. But be aware you can only film, adjust lighting and change frame rate."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ITS SO REALLY NICE!!! BUT I CANT UPDATE MY SOUND BG ETC..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Overall creation of animation is fine. The only downside is that the file isn't exported as a file that can be used by my phone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really nice app I've been making lot of army men videos. But something is not good, if you want to text or draw I Need to pay 4,99 dollars!!! I mean my Mom does not pay for a APP!! I hope one day everything in stop motion Will be free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a very good app but 1 thing that could be improved that there should be a option to cut copy the charecters image and paste it somewhere else like in those frames that need something flying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Does the job as a beginner"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great! Lots of nostalgia... When i was really little I used to play with this app with my cousin... We made awful stop motions but my experience led me to using it now. I love this app, the musics, the us, everything... JUST WHY DID THEY REMOVE THE LITTLE CLIPS YOU COULD WATCH"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"godddddddddd"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Usless app i can not even select images from my folder"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It wants your account"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The graph doesnt work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love the app am so good at stop motion this is a good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"just good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Garbage garbage and nonsense maybe try adding some better features and sound"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app was great, now, it isn't. You literally cannot do ANYTHING except... Film. Not text, no music, nothing. I remember these were free. Now, you are required to buy just so you can use the app. You are not gaining anything because people are eventually going to edit it with other apps."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Okok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Doesnt even let you import pictures without paying."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app of stop motion ive made plentey of movies!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is such a dissapointment. I spent 3 hours on an animation and it has put a black screen ontop of almost every ten photos I have taken. On each of the black screens its has in bold white letters media not found. Making the video I spent hours working on a complete waste of my time. If I were you I would think twice before getting this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The inability to delete or inset slides and the hilarious number of very basic features restricted to the premium version make this app an honest waste of time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"worst app ever when i try to make a new movie a ad pops up and i cant get rid of it fix it plese"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This experience of stop motion videos led me to make more and more stop motion videos and yet it is really fun, though when I bought the one week editing it still wouldn't let me edit and yet I bought it multiple time and it still didnt work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like it but I want the green screen for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think this is a very good app it doesn't take much data what I love and it is offline the only thing I don't like is that it costs money to have pictures from your camera roll In."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is trash you have to pay to do something I do not suggest to get this app if you don't want to spend money on a trash app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I made purchase of ‚Çπ420 and haven't got the features ...my money is deducted i need my money back right now ...this is fraud ...you guys need to answer me !!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°√â √©c JUV√Å!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Subscribe time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good for animation! I make stick bot films with It!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"There is no way for me swap the position of frames, such as if you wanted to swap a set of frames with other frames (like a scene you may have recorded). So, be careful as if you forgot to record a certain thing and you already have a ton on frames in front of the section you want to record, you'd have to delete them if you want to record a new thing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Meh ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This help meh"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like it but, I have a problem. The whole app works fine, but I'm mad. There used to be a section where you could watch other little stop motions. It was something for me to do when I was bored. After an update tho, that was removed. Please add it back. If you do ill change my review."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This is a very good app but I cant make things jump! I know how to but the app says you have to pay to import. THATS THE STUPIDEST THING EVER! I just want a good free stop motion app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was a bruh moment"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is so good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its garbage takes way to long to download. I live on the streets so 1g sucks. Donate 1 pound a day."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I bought this a couple of years ago and now it's saying I have to pay 4.99 to use it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a great app but I wish you could unlock the full app and all are great things we can create the best animated videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Works well enough and I love the transparency for lining up pics. But if I try to export the images it tells me it's done so but there's nothing there, whether downloading or sharing via email..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why do stop motion apps never let you use screenshots, so useless"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I used this before on a another phone and i love it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Most of the important features are locked"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its all good except you need to pay to add audio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Fun to do movies but for visual effects we have to pay...And now the app keeps crashing"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I loved this app I had many videos on it I had made and also had paid for some of the in app purchases but u deleted it for space but when I re-downloaded it was all gone. I hope there is a way you can help me to get my stuff back."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and it makes making stop motion so much easier I'm a stop motion fan. I was inspired to do stop motion cause of a YouTube channel. Called popsicles4fun so pleas go and her out she does alot of stop motion."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"can i even select photos i take from my camera not in this app if you do change it (just put a selection and do not remove the camera probably people use it) i will change my stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I want to export my video but I can't plzz fix it so I rate it 4 star but this app is great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I wanted to do this but I couldn't take photos because I have the Samsung galaxy S10+ so the capture button wasn't available so I took the photos on my camera and now I have to pay to import the photos. Other than the fact that you have to pay for most features, this is pretty good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like this but ALMOST ALL THIS STUFF you need to pay for also when you record voice half of the screen is gone and its hard to see so can you make it a bit thiner plz :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Hey that's Not Bad! I dont have to take pictures and waste space!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice i like it i can make animation in stop motion i like it i can stop making with this app so much."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This has got to be the best. Ideal for on the fly animation and much more. I was bowled over by just what a powerful app it is. It's been great for action figure animations on holidays"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This app is full of problems, even the paid version. If you want to record you're own audio, you're going to have a big headache. Most of the time, the audio won't even work. It will just load and load. Some functions work one day and the next they don't. If everything worked well, I would recomend this to you but because they don't, I definitely don't recomend getting this. Also, the video quality is all over the place. It's blurry no matter what setting I do."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"A lot better and more features than other stop motion apps, and even if you don't buy the pack your not missing any key features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's nice, I like it."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Lego Toys ActionFigures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"WORST!!! app ever I can't save my project in my gallery worst app don't download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good app, harder than I expected, app doesn't have everything though. You have to pay $5.00 to get extra effects"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Won't let me export the movie I made"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app really inspired me! I love making scenes with my lego minifigures, and this made those scenes come to life!!! If you are planning on getting pro, I would recomend it. On thing is that when you're on chromebook, it won't let you export it on to any gallery apps. If you want to see what I made, I have a few movies on YouTube (Under this google account if you're intrested). Overall awesome app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"app does not let u film only pictures and most features are premium only i hate ig"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a good stop motion app, me and my brother use it to make playmobil movies.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I liked it! I found it easy to control and good to use. I dont think that you need the pro version since this is perfect to use. Dont waste money on the pro one when you can film lol suprise stop motions of the free version!!‚ò∫"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is SUPER good but I wish they would add transformation sounds."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app! Recommending it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I would like to at least make the erasing feature in the normal version and it would make my animations easy to make with no problems"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"After trying several stop animation type apps on the store I have found this the best and easiest to use with my daughter. I am impressed with the UI and its functions. I would love there to be a community type feature to see others animations and learn from the community. Fully recommend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing and can be useful for those who wish to create some unique videos or to show creativity through their videos...100/100 for this app! Splendid work by the teamüëèüèªüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I couldn't use it without paying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The reviews looked good, so I thought I'd try it. Other ones I've tried failed, so I thought this would be good. It is, but you have to pay to use simple features. I totally thought that the green screen would be nicer, and adding sound that actually plays at the appointed time, but like I said, you have to pay to use those features."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have use it from years .very cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"No support. Please don't pay for this! They refused to refund purchase after app clearly not functioning correctly and that was within one hour of purchase. Total scam."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app but it took up a lot of my storage would recommend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad quality and you have to pay 5 bucks if you want to import images made from device"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You have to pay to get backgrounds and titles and the app is easy to work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why can't I get this appüòîüòî"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best animation application ever! You should pay for the 5 dollar pack to get all the features. I like doing Lego stop motion animation, I've been doing it for years, and I've tried many apps for animating, and this is by far the best animation app I've ever seen! All Lego animators should get this!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"At first the app was awesome but after a few days of having this the video would only play the last 5 frames this is very annoying and there's no way of fixing it in the settings so I can't even properly make any videos anymore so I'm uninstalling this app. So all in all NOT a good app.üò†üò†üò§"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Great features but when you save it it comes out glitchy. Took me so long to make a stop motion for Instagram and it was all for nothing sigh."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty good. I've used it for at least a year. It works pretty well and it has a good interface. And it's REALLY easy and simple to use. I only have 1 problem with it. It doesn't have the best sound fx. They are kinda cheesy. I wish there were more sound fx and better sound fx. Other than that, it's a really great app. And speaking of sound fx, they won't work! I don't know why but it just won't play sound fx and it's really annoying because I need them for a video I'm making."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåü"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is amazing apart from the fact that I don't know how to put it onto the 
theatre yet"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing app dis is"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"its good but i cant save the video i really want to put it on youtube since i have a youtube channel but i cant so yeah its great but i cant save it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Every time I make a stop motion video the app freezez and it takes me out of the app. Then, when I try to go back to the app my stop motion video is deleted. Forcing me to start all over again."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It so AWSOM"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not good has had update now it won't work on my phone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I do want tto give it 5 but there a problem with the loading i mean you can still dk stop motion but when you try to play the video it just keeps replaying the load over and over even when voice acting it well do the samething pls fix this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Hi it the b0mb"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I Like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this for stop motion no ads but some fees but none are hidden its like sonic mania"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app I adore it I make so many videos with it and my family loves it and it's amazing I recommend you to get this 100% I guess that's amazing there's no glitches and it's a fun app to play when your bored you do not need internet for and that's an amazing thing cars that go in road trips so just get the app and make me happy."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is fun to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üòûüò¢üôè it not work it didn't install üò≠üò≠"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its the best because you can make your own funny cartoons thats cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I DON'T reccomend buying it. If you want to add a photo from your computer, you have to but premium for $5. This app is horribile because I don't take pictures and only use the ones in my computer. I WAS exited untill I found out how BAD it was. Again, I DON'T reccomend buying it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"WHY DOES EVERYTHING COST"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is stupid it gliched"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Yeah, its a good app to animate But does not deserve 5 star rating"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Waaaw"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app worked fine until about a week ago. Then it started to slowly get worse. I can't watch my videos when I am in them (I can only watch when I'm in home) And I cannot editusic and sound effects. Please fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Dis is a veri good ""stop motion studio""!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app is decent but it's not letting me click more than 29 frames. Can someone help with that?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I rate this a 5 star cause it is very fun to make cute animations with clay playdoh or dolls! I recomend it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Would recommend, the free version allows you to make great stop motion videos without watermarks. Has nice and user friendly design and I feel the amount of features behind the one time purchase is about right, because the app is absolutely usable without it (there aren't even ads). The best free stop motion android app I have found."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I lot of the pro things in the app are a lot than pic pac you should add some things for free from the pro but i dont want to buy things"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's just like any ordinary stop motion app, nothing special."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its an great app no add and also easy to make video I gave full rate to this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Good set up but can not use manual"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's easy to use. However, files frequently become unusable and crash the app upon opening, and uploading to YouTube results in sloppy, stuttering video. I can see this being great for some fun during quarantine, but for a polished, finished piece, these issues are bad signs."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I use it for my nascar stopmotions (mdcs stopmotions) and it works amazingly with no watermark and hd quality. I had a problem exporting my video and I sent an email and they got back within 15 minutes with a website for help and it worked and so I know they really care about their users and that is just amazing so definitely download this. I have tried lifelapse, pic pac, and more and none of them come close to this one! üëçüëåüíØ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it. It has everything which I need to use like making cars movies and lego movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"hardly any free fetures..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It works well and cool for youtube üòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"No lo he probado aun pero tengo esperazas a que es mi problema resueltoüê∂üç≠‚ú®‚ö´‚ö™ :-)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this app can make movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Only because most apps allow audio for free, and you don't even get to get audio for an ad, now I won't be able to do most of the animations I was going to do"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Post"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the best app ever! This is so easy to use and you can take the pictures directly and is so cool."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Epic I love stop motion studio I upload to YT and get so many views"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I was rated 3 because I need music in this stop motion for free I'm just bored of cartoons that no music so pls make it free just music only I will rate you 5 stars soon üòÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everytime i play it kept on starting at the end"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't even get even one thing free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Hey I love the app but recently all the images I take or upload to the app are really low quality even when it on 4k mode, I'm not having this problem with any other apps, how do I fix this?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I was a little bit confused at first but after looking up a tutorial on YouTube this app is amazing and can do a lot of things you can do on a high-tech tablet or laptop and has amazing features an amazing thing to use for beginners with only a phone definitely recommend to everyone and super easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing !!! but I wish more stuff was for free that is why I gave it 4 stars."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It was a 5 stars before the latest update, but then I have to turn it into a 2 because I was used to download the pics from my gallery rather than making it straight away from the app itself. It was all good but now when I try to download the pics they let me do in the wrong way rather then it supposed to be. So I hope they gonna find out what is goin on and fix it thanks !"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's is very unique and good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"piano"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to import image from gallery this app is suck"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very fun demolition download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"A nice app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I was just trying to find an app that could turn all my photos into a stop motion video. But in order for you to import your photos you have to pay five dollars like wow. Great job guys"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This stopmotion app is üëå. The only reason i give em a 4‚≠ê instead of a 5‚≠ê is cause sometimes i hav to üëÄ for like everything and i dont like spending my day looking for a special feature to my stopmotions. Also i cant really find my way out of the stopmotione page where u take pics so i can post my awesome stopmotions on youtube or text my friends so they can watch my stopmotions. i reccomend this app. When u start, it may be confusing but u can get used to after a while using stopmotion studio."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty good"

Not sure what's the problem is. I gave 3 stars because of the review that others made. I hope I get to hve this interesting app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Had to get this for a school project thought I could take pictures from my phone then import them to the app and I have to pay. Why should people have to pay to import photos they took from their phone. But honestly otherwise works great, just that pay to import, I'd rather watch ads before and after making a project, just saying."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its going to be a awesome videoüëçüëçüëç"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"My dad bought the cool stuff but it did not worküòÖ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Used this app for my art club and it makes stop motion so fun! Highly reccomend. I love that you can use existing pictures in your camera roll (incase you took the pictures before having an app) or take them right then and there."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I purchased the pro version. My account is debited but I'm still unable to use it. The app shows a purchase again despite already paying for it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible because I just started it and EVERYTHING was not loading. I couldn't even do 1 video or stop motion picture"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its great! I've used this for making YouTube videos, which have been quite successful for me. Its a really fun hobby to make stopmotion and soon im going to get the Pro version! Really recommend it for begginers as its easy to use! Just make a new movie, take the photos for it, export it then BAM! You got your stopmotion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible, you can't do anything without having to pay money. If you don't intend on paying money, DO NOT use this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app, out of all the stop motion making apps i have ever tried, this is the best one but i wish we could get free erasing permission without pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"What a game"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'm gonna try it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It helps me make lego stop motion videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like this app to make movies and stuff, but it asks me to upgrade for $5. I already upgraded, but before it was laggy. Great still."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was So GOOD i cant beleive it .... It help me in my YOUTUBE Channel And now i can do better with Stop Motion Pro... i highly recommend that you download this peice of art üòÉ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I deleted 3 things for this app but still it isn't getting downloaded and now I am not able to download the 3 things again üòÇüòÇ Oo bete moj kardi wah bahi wah"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why you make need to buy or you sracry"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use, looks good, and best of all, I can export my projects directly to YouTube. If you're looking for the perfect stop motion app, stop looking, you found it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!! I use it to create stop motions and it is very useful and easy to use. The only thing that annoys me is that so many cool features are only for paying users, but I get that they need that to make money. Here is a tip for anybody who wants to make cool stop motions but not pay for premium: After you make and save the stop motion, import it into a video editing app (I use and recommend YouCut). That way you can have it edited for free. Overall great app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Works so well better than anyother app for it although there are a few to any ads"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good stopmotion app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app but it said you can make any coler you want to be your green screen also blue picks up black gray white as blue and green white and black plees fix this and I'll give you üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü also could you add a rain setting because it would be hard to draw on each frame loads of blog lines also can only use blue screen ther is no opting for color"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When it started there was immediately a pop up saying we had to pay which couldn't be closed"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This could really need an update. Pro version is great. But it really needs something to make it amazing. Like maybe visual effects. They would work wonders for most users. An update that isnt a bug fix and is something much needed. Is an upgrade for the utilities in the software. Sometimes it bugs out and doesnt let you save a file. I've never had to re shoot. It was all still there but you need to just give it another go. It may take some time to load up the app if you have lots of projects."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"What a trash app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"GOBSHITE! CANT EVEN GET TO THE STOP MOTION PART WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE GOD DAMN PRO VIRSION! HOW? YOU MAY ASK!? WELL. WHEN THE PRO BUYING THING COMES UP AND YOU CLICK OFF IT. THE THING SHOWS UP AGAIN! 0/10!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è job"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Well I love this app I have no problems! Maybe 1 you can make that much pictures. But you can make videos and stuff like that! I love this app but make it have more pictures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't download, I wanted to make and animation for the intro of my youtube videos but it wouldn't download it would just go in a loop of downloading and as soon as it finished it would restart the whole prosses.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Accidentally purchased the full upgrade after having also bought the Pro and I am being tod that they wont refund it. RIDICULOUS POLICY AND WAY TO IRRITATE A NEW CUSTOMER"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"(I'd give this app a 4 or 5 stars, except recently I've had a problem with uploading projects to photos or google drive. It may be connected to the latest samsung/android update. Without being able to upload my files the app is useless.) Nevermind, they fixed the problem. Five stars here"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good app! But you have to pay for the actual features i was planning pn makong a hot wheels animation but the thing you have to pay but its still a amazing app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I paid the ¬£4.99 to update the features , how do I use the features and is this a once off payment as it did not state it was a monthly payment? How would I know if I can use the features or not?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app but it does not give us the music for free we have to pay for the music but still it is a very good app you should also downlode very good for biginersüëçüëçüëçü§ØüíØüíØ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüò∫üò∫"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I paid 5 dollars to get the full application and features, but as soon as I paid, the app started crashing! No fix for it! I want my 5 dollars back!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Personally people need to make more stuff like that thanks man and mannet sorry. Thanks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I stubed my toe hit my head got bit by my dog then went outside to be hit by this brands truck"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Actual garbage"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very good i love this app but you cant use any of the credits or stuff like that unless you pay for it if i didnt have to pay for those things i would give a 5 star rating."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its awesome I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I dont know how to use it its very confusing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"i would love if it was free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I've made lots of movies using the free version of the app and it works very good but the only things you can do with the free version is take the pics do voice over and export ( it takes quite a while to export) But on the upside you get all of the features forever for only 5 bucks. So my only complaints are make more features free and make some kind of way to sign in because when I delete the app or try to get it on a new device all of my movies get deleted unless I save them"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like the app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It is not downloading"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"All the basic and advanced features are in the paid version, it isn't worth downloading this app if you were looking for a free complete experience"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Aap not working and so many changes for cheap features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the best so far, I like it, made me feel like i was really animating, lol"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"this app suck it does not work and you have to pay for so much of it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Considering importing photos a premium paid feature is an instant install/uninstall in my book. Too bad, was looking forward to using the app a lot."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Woooow"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"i love this it has cool stuff"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"A lot of inapp purchases"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really cool app! I love doing stop motion animation with this app and I am enjoying it very much, though I do think that we shouldn't have to pay for the sound effects, but I know that I'm not uninstalling this app any time soon!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very very very bad app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have my students use this app every year for a stop motion project. The free version does everything they need, including voice-over. They can submit to Canvas directly from the app and it is pretty intuitive for them to use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's okay"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best Stop Motion App"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Because I don't have a 200$ for the editing"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"love this app. works exactly as expected. never have I ever seen a non premium version of an app this good. good job devs. i will probably buy the full version later in life when I'll have more money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its so easy to use but my camera is falling bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app but what bugs me is that we have to buy the features which we easily get for free in albums app. But, it's AMAZING üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Makes good video clips but severely undermines the audio quality. I paid 5 dollars to put in a decent audio clip of my own creation and it came out sounding horrible."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It didn't give me the manual option but other than that it's a good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"One of the better animation app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Really bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It graet"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The quality of the images is way worse then when I just take a photo."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Jjjjj Gooooood"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything you have to be VIP to do I'm kinda annoyed I deleted the app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing good quality"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great for movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is very useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is a very buggy app which I don't like at all....and also no offense, but this app is not at all user friendly!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice üëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The features in this app are really good, until you get a new phone, where the pro version that you pay for does not pass on to the new phone, despite the fact it was downloaded with the same account. There is no way to reclaim the pro version,you have to pay again, which I'm not going to. But when I had the pro version it was good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It has great option to inhance stop motion but not free‚òπÔ∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,". ????"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"As I tought is not fully Free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is probably the best and great quality app for stop motion you can start of by and example and move to simple and easy steps and watch you creation!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing for free animation software. Really quite versatile and seems good quality."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is epic it can make eneything move! You should totally install it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool aap, it's so easy to use.This aap has cool features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is amazing app. I really like it.üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app ever seen for stop motion animation I like it and made a animated movie with my friends and it was awesome me and my friends liked the app. Thanks Stop motion studio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice aap"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Before I bought the version which probably included an update I was able to see the whole video while recording sound but now half of the screen is covered making it harder to sync voice with video. Please fix this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very laggy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is very great i can change the frame rate and most apps i see dont have that i suggest if you are new a low speed if you dont like it change it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"very best superb app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app is ok but when I do my stop motion it takes pictures really slow"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Superb app Imade my first stop motion video. Best app that's it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing!! Must have app!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"3 stars nothing to say"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Not good on android... Frame capture is too slow......................."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Pretty good üòéüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good but I will give 4 stars because some times it go and come why is that happening its is my phone problem?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is just what I was looking for, however I want to use the button on my earphones as shutter Rather than bluetooth remote. It works in my stock camera app but not with this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This is one of the apps that shows your hands when using you can make a video back when I used to use it for whatever it's a little annoying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love, love, LOVE this app!! Lots of really nice features like the 'ghost' image for you to line a shot up with the previous one. The free version has enough features to make fab little movies. My son (8) has made some great movies by himself, and I'm addicted too! We've bought the full app which has more great features. What's not to love?!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid up for upgrade but unable to upgrade whilst funds currently in pending on account."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to be able to add images"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I say this is great... I have been using this for very long... My only problems is that when you are recording audio the big RECORDING is taking up the whole screen so you cannot time it right, and finally, i had to install screen recorder to be able to download it because you cannot do it on there... But i recomend it for anybody who is bored in the house."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It does not start when I click play."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Is it me or everytime I make a stop motion and then I get done with it every time i want to watch it it take for every to load???"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wow im really happy on stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its a great app üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"verrryyy good chickenuggets quack quack chicken noises"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wow! , what a app! Not bad for 94 MB! i did not need to pay for downloading even though we can make movies with photos! And also i wanted to share but i couldnt! So i didnt! I thought this app should be upto 1.3 GB! But no! 94 MB! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! I MADE more than 67 movies without no data needed ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good bug one thing make a a share feature please I would love that thz"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I was saving a video and literally DAYS of work just wasted it just froze when I tried to edit it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible on android, almost completely washes out the colour of your camera and makes it impossible to do any type of green screen. Very bad."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing very fast load times very good pictures and really really good system"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I would recomend to find another app unless anyone wants to pay everything before you could do anything on this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Increable the best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app, its easy to use, the editing and buyable features a a pretty good deal as well, and it jas helped me build my brickfilm channel, ""SH4DO Studios"". However there is one feature I really wish this app had. A project recovery option. When you delete a project from the home menu,(by accident or purposely) it is gone FOREVER! This is annoying because i now have to start all over when I do it on accident. If Catear reads this review, please add a feature that allows video recovery."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I would put zero stars if I could it's great and all but after a while it's stops working"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"YOU CAN MAKE REAL VIDS AND ITS THE BEST APP EVER DOWNLOAD THIS INSTINT. P.S. don't make bad vids."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Not able to share videos made on it. When share, it shows file not supported. This problem faced today by me, earlier it was working fine."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app. It is very easy to use and it has many features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its great to play around but I do wish I could use sound effects for free bc I can pay for pro but it good fot school projects just maybe free sound effects would be good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing because the app are really realistic in video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"App crashes on Export... Cannot export /share via. any app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its very good all you need to do is put 20 frames per second it might tqke a while but its fine"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its fun, but i try to buy the features, it wont let me and the screen just turns black, other than that, its amazing!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horible ble"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app. It would be quite useful having access to turning the phone flash/light on and have some control of reducing the intensity. perhaps? Other wise. Great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The photographing process worked well but when it came to sharing the video it just wouldnt export, and downloading it as a gif made it incredibly low quality. Also couldn't find an option to make the video loop which was annoying because I was working on a walk cycle. Would probably be 4 stars (for a free app) if my video would export at full quality :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is good but does need an update, if they added things like visule effects it would greatly improve the app. It would also be good if everything was not primium and a bit more of it was free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Not the best, I would not recommend this since it is really slow to take pictures and so it can often get your hands in the way because it processes the picture for about 4 seconds before saving it and also it quite often pops up saying that I should buy the pro version which I don't want"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Great app overall... The only reason it gets a one star is because when I am done making my vids, I can't export them to anything. Complete waste of time. If I was able to export, then no doubt, I would easily give this 5 stars."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This game is amazing!!! The only thing I dislike about it is that you need to pay money for audio:/"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good app üëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice appüòÄüòÄ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is so fun and uses a lot of teamwork"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its good but its laggy plzz help"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Excellent first experience, my friends loved my first animated movie. Some issues on my Vivo phone, like occasional crashing but work is automatically saved, so no big deal. Brilliant app. Five 5‚É£ stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DONT GET THIS APP, IT MAY BE FREE TO GET BUT TO DO ANYTHING TH AT ISNT TAKING PICTURES, YOU HAVE TO PAY!!!!!!!!! WORST APP EVER!!!!! EVEN IF I WANT A TITLE, IT BRING UP A SCREEN TELLONG ME I HAVE TO PAY!!! TRUST ME, SAVE YOUR TIME, IT DOESNT EVEN SAVE THEM SO I CANT UPLOAD IT TO MY PC!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The Best!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It works great and it makes it so easy to make a stop motion video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. I would say 3 stars, but there's probably no better free stopmotion app out there. Speaking of free, I wish some of the features didn't require premium. Basically all you can do is take photos and make a video out of them, no extra features."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing app,its easy to use etc, but I bought the premium thing and it still didn't let me,idk if its a bug but other than that its Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is such a good app i rate it 5 stars it is such creative app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Ops This Is A Good App üëç But There Is Every Thing to Buyyyy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This does noyhing but its simple to do i did a video with my lego man"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Lol importing images requires paid app. Literally this can all be done by google photos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Lame, can't add photos already taken outside the app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it is smooth"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why cant i record anymore >:("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like this app but this is what pisses me of the app just won't let me see my sonic film because it freesed üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°but it's a good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think it is good without premium because I bought premium and it didn't really make it better so it was a waste of money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"With litterlaly everything you need to buy to have it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"omg this app is gREATTT"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"well i would like to changethe camra"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is easy to use. But it doesn't work on Android. I can't save my project on my phone. üëé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"What happen to stop motion??? It sucks now! i can't even upload!! Jeez, Stop motion app sucks now."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So much fun easy to use 5 star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Only used this for a school project and I had to download multiple times into photos because it wouldn't let me add it to my drive. Then a couple days later when i went to my gallery to show my mom a picture, i just see many pages of the animation i did and had to delete alot of pictures. I dont know if thats what happens when you add it to the gallery but it's annoying."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Just a great animation app, the best one i've ever used."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Using free version and so far it's fine. Needed it for a simple stopmotion animation, no green screen, rotoscoping or 4K. Just simple animation. Not sure if I'd buy in-app upgrade instead of full featured app though."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This game is fun and easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Stucked after selecting images ....it shows select image size that's it nothing works"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"App simply does not work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I wish you cloud do more with out sending $5.00"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Same problem here, just paid ¬£5 for this app and the features, which are actually for the pro version, which i need to pay separately, false advertising! Apart from this , i was enjoying the app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is used to do my special animating videos this is so cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I had some experience in this app I am telling this is good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Dont install this!!! You have to buy evrything for it to work and you cant do special efeects without money . DONT BUY THIS!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Works perfect and the free version has more features than I expected."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app people having problems is maybe there are something wrong with there phone or something like that but I wish the graphics on everyone phone were excellent"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app I got 100 subscribers through this app on YouTube!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is great to make my lego stop motions. Recommend 17/10 absolutely fantastic for beginners. Even recommend for above 9 yrs age great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Charge me almost $7 and it doesn't work? My kid Try to upload photos and there are two 'options' to choose a format that don't exist!? I want a refund, Thanks.. OH AND edit just to warn perants they want me to pay AGAIN to upload the app to my phone now to test if this is the same issue on my phone too, even though I've already paid for it on my account ? I have Samsung note20 ULTRA & my kids got Samsung galaxy s9+ so really there is no excuse for it to be an issues on our end"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It take a little bit to get used to but it didn't say stopmotion would be easy I see reviews on how bad this is but its not the app stopmotion is hard to figure out so don't hate on this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It glitches out when I try to export to Google Photos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app üëå you can make a great stop motion animation with this app üòÄ only one this to say about this app is Superb üòÜ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like it but it would be better if we can turn the face upside down then i would give it 5 star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bought to make a video and tried to upload pictures for it. The images didnt show and when I clicked on them anyway I got stuck in the choose a version menu."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good I started my own stop motion/claymation youtube channel using this app and its great my channel name is SuperDudeProductions"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Its good but i bought pro version on the same google play account on my old phone and it wont transfere the pro version to my new phone. It just says i have to buy it again. Save the money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I cant import photos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is just what I need :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to buy pro version to import photos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I don't upload picture in my galery. And if i want upload i must paid it. -,-"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Import pictures only if you pay 5eur."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It would be five stars but I recently installed this app again and all of the cool old features are now having toe be payed for but all in all its a good app..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Is this a scam or what? After making payment, I selected a picture and to the next, no image format is selecting....what am I supposed to do. It's annoying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I just hate that you have to pay for simple things its like ea all over again"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I agree with everyone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really good app but u have to pay to use tools and I'm a kid so I dont have money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I havent try it yet but i think it is nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"So, great app. Highly recommend but its very anoying how the last photo you took doesnt ghost over your camera. thats all."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"IT SUCKS"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I'm highly disappointed. The app completely disabled everything and only wants money to unlock every feature. This clearly the worst app for making a stop motion school project. Dear students, if you're using this app, DELETE IT NOW! Also dear owners of the app, please make everything for free NOW! I'm a kid, and I want you to unlock every feature of this app. I will never use my mom's wallet to pay for your features, I want these feature FOR FREE AND RIGHT NOW üëø!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Im not sure"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Super app. Very pleasant experience so far."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"At first I had plenty of issues with the app but after plenty of updates and fixes from the creators this app has become a staple in my everyday life"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is great and awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was super fun 5 stars for shure"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't uplaod things from your deviece"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is a very bad app because in 2020 i could get on and make a movie but now if i try to, it keeps pulling up purchases if you want to see for reals go my my youtube channle called ""Koster Parker"". thanks and dont download this, if i could give this app a 0 star review i would."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is actually amazing for YouTubers but it completely doesn't have a single feature free . We can't even import our own photos, if you are a person who doesn't want to pay soooo much money on every single feature like me please don't install this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a good app for stop motions it's easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I think editing should be free but yeah my yt vids are getting somewhere"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is amazing dude you don't even have to pay i love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love making stop motion with this app i will never delete this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's really good for a stop motion app but the free version just seems slightly hollow. You can animate and add sounds but most of the other stuff is locked behind a paid app. But for $5 for the premium. It's probably worth it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sucks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Muy √∫til!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's kinda of DUMB!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded the app and payed to use it. But I can't even even upload the images. It's stuck where it asks to choose a format."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid for premium and wont show me photos just shows me grey squares"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It takes up a lot of storage and it's a lot of work, bit over all great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's horrible and not real it's just a scam and soooo many adds...i hate it soooi much üòëüíîüôÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"App is junk. I bought the pro version to make a stop motion movie using image files but it glitches during the import steps. No images appear when selecting which to import, just grey squares. Even after choosing them the app freezes at the next step to choose image format - just two black rectangles with no way to choose anything. Save your $5."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"MONEY GRABBING is the only Motion going on here. I have contacted Googleplay who directed me to the owners of the app. I paid for the pro version and it does not work yet when I have asked for a refund, three times now, I have been fobbed off. My requests keep falling on deaf ears, do not waste you money, there are other apps that will do the job properly and for free. I will be complaining to the highest order as that's the only way I will be getting what I am due for this rubbish."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's dope"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't even import your own audio or anything without paying. What's the point"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So good....üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great but needs you to be able to use a green screen for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is just perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Please enable the erasing tool then I can give 5 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Yeah, it's great for making stop motions. I love this app a whole bunch and I personally think that paying the $5 is worth it for all the features!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Well I love this but It doesn't show how do I make the erase button actually erase not add üòêüò¢üò≠üò°"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Requested a refund as all my photos were blank grey squares when I tried to import them. Looks like it would be a good app if it actually worked. Very disappointing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This game work!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You must atleast add 5 free features. And we even can not add pictures from the gallery"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app even though u have to pay for pro u can do so much without it! I love how this app works and what i can do with it im giving it 5üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Fun, and a big help, but I don't want to pay for a premium, and that kinda feels hollow. I also sometimes don't get to add audio to my video, even though it's only 10 seconds long. So please fix that. But over that, it's a very good app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Paid for the pro version, does not work. Refund requested. Avoid."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this thinking I was going to make a spectacular Lego stop motion video .... I was dead wrong. Every take come out fuzzy, the audio won't match the same speed as the photos. And they think that by adding a promo video (Big Fish) that it would help people understand it better. News flash it doesn't."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid for it and it just showsme a black screen. Wish I could get my money back. Big scam"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Good but you can't put it on social media at all ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its okay, it just takes too much space."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a really good app, but you need premium to do pretty much everything,all I can really do without premium is just take pictures and put them together, which I can do with a normal editor."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"¬£5 to import from gallery, abdolute trash"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Hate this, you can not put your own photos in your own animation without paying 5 dollars, also you can't get better picture quality without paying 5 dollars either, so I delt with horrible quality pictures, so don't get this, unless you want to pay 5 dollars to have premium a month."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"5 stars can't wait till I get pro version."

The only thing I would like is the ability to have an overlay ghost image of the previous frame over the current camera view. This would help with aligning the frames and making smoother adjustments/movements. Hope you can add this in a future update!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is probably the best stop motion app. I recommend it for beginners."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love it specifically the ghost tool, really nice for stop motions but there is a weird glitch. When I'm taking photos, sometimes in the camera appears a weird flash. I know it's not my camera. Please fix this"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this app so much i have now a subscriber because of my videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a very good app but the reason I gave it 4 stars is you can't turn the camera the other way, so it's hard to pose my camera. But still it's my favorite animation app of all."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"this app is great its free,fun to make videos with and you can timelapse to but the downside is some of the tools is not available so you need to pay some of the tools"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Great but too expensive, it needs to be free, $4.99 is too much for the features, therefore, 1 star."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It i easy to get use to and really useful to make projects üôÇ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Brilliant! Loving using this app. Definitely worth paying for it as you then get the option to add sound, titles & credits. Perfect for my needs. There's a couple of things I'd like to see, but they don't detract from the quality of the app. I'd like to be able to create and save titles and credits as templates so I don't have to keep typing them. I'd like to see new tracks added occasionally. The included music is good, but more are needed. Works perfectly on my Galaxy S20+5G."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is pretty fun and good except for the stupid part of the have to pay for extra editing! It's stupid because I got the app for the being able to add on to my videos. But anyways I enjoy its simplicity."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I have made some good movies with this app, but the thing is, if the movie is too long, it takes so long to load. Other than that, great app, but I think you need to make pro version free for people with real talent, but not enough money. I know you probably won't listen, so I'm ending it here. Great app you got..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app. If you want to make stop motions get this! Its great. You can buy one extra thing that let's you have a lot more in the app. As I'm writing this I'm doing a lego star wars stop motion. BEST stop motion maker ever!"

It is good for beginners, but it doesn't have a lot of options for more complicated things so if you are a begginer at stop motion, this is great!! If you have been doing stop motion for a while, it's not bad, but maybe not the best for you."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to do anything and there are to many ads dont download"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a really really good app, it is 5th on the list for best stop motion technology but you cant tell how much storage it takes. when your storage is full you cant do eny stop motions eny more and you have to delete some of your stop motions. I was in the middle of one and and I could not finish it. now I cant do eny more its the worst fealing ever. besides that it just stops in the middle of the stop motion its really really good app."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Why won't it let me delete recording"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I could not export until I paid for the app, which was frustrating. After paying, it was really hard to find features. I had to watch a youtuber's tutorial to figure out a lot of the main features. Otherwise, an amazing app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Fantastic app, but what did I pay for? I paid to upgrade to pro, but I don't have access to the sound clips or adding a background as advertised. Erase tool is also more of a blur tool. It would be helpful to have a guide or instructions."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and I am giving it a 4/10 because it is really easy to use but it's just not what I am looking for literally everything costs money üí∞üëé even just backgrounds I recommend a better app like iMovie or something I think you should go check that out I hope this helps you umm so yeah xxoo from ME"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's pretty funny if you have the right equipment Personally l rate 4/4 it is pretty fun if you do have to write equipment but you can use construction paper like South Park"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Is good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Useless software If you don't pay. I got this thinking I could use it, but without the paid version you can't import the photos you want to work with, so they have to be taken in the app, but there's no in app editing either meaning you are basically making a glorified slideshow without any control."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Wrost app in my life I am enjoying my I can anymate app.please don't download it will waste your time and data both...."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app no promblopsüòéüòéüôå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Es buena, el problema es q hay q pagar para poner im√°genes, audio, texto, etc"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its a paid app, dsnt allow yu to try even.. you should give a try only after yu pay 500 rs"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is very cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't use any photos you've already taken or edit photos without paying. For my purposes this makes it completely useless"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It is a fun app, but i can not export my project as a video to my phone,it says that my phone does not suport that video format. There is no way for me to export the project anywhere and that is the reason i give it 1 star. Hope they fix this..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT! Now I can finally make stop motion videos with my Godzilla toys."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I make really clean stop motions now! Thank you :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The video upload process is realy finicky and takes a while but it works"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Worked fine at first but then after editing, it uploads only half of my frames!?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is really good and super easy to make but there is one problem, that most of the things are for money . This app is really good and I won a video contest because of this app üíü"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the best app ever I love stopmotion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Once you pay the 5 dollars for all the in app features it's well worth it. The controls are so easy to learn and the editing is a dream."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Eventhough add image is for buyüòë"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It sucked"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Remember using this liked it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's very good to use because it is not confusing and there is a button that tells you what everything does."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Was very straightforward to make a little test animation. Unfortunately none of the export options actually successfully export a file, so the rest of the app performance is irrelevant."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is a really good app but i feel like you shouldent have to pay to have green screen.but other than that its a good app 4 out of 5 stars 9 out of 10."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this amazing app on my phone, and it works amazing! Love this app, its so easy to use. 5 stars!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When i make a new project i pres on every buttons but nothing happens"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is greatly outstandingly amazing! I used it to make stop motion videos for my YouTube channel, and it has the ability to make things fly without wires! iMuy exellente! Edit: I cant upload my video! Why is it not working?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"5 steren"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You can't use filters, or add credits, or basically do anything without paying money. You can do stop motions, but the camera quality is pretty bad, and I don't want to pay money to do get filters and make it look good. This app is pretty inconvenient."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app for beginners or pros!! It is the best app to use!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice and very easy."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"For backgrounds you have to pay but it is a very fun app i recomennd"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"So bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing I started my own youtube channel with this app and got a lot of good ideas. Check my channel it's stop motion animashion"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I can make lego stop motion films"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love stop motion studios"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I made a movie of big fat cat from this app it is really great my parents said excellent I'm excited to make more movies from this app whoohooooo! ü§©ü§©ü•∞üòäüòá"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Pues que quieres que te diga, la aplicacion en si es bastante buena, la interfaz es un poco incomoda y para corregir un error hay que hacer todo un proceso, eso le quita una estrella. Y lo otro es que cada vez que voy a exportar el video sale da√±ado y eso molesta mucho, eso le quita su otra estrella"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is the best stop motion a app i scene"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"never mid this is the best app now i just buight the features they are the best thank you i (obiously have a youtube chanel and i made movies and posted them"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Disappointed.. U must buy everything!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"A good app to learn and create stop motion animation videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't even import pictures. Asks to pay to even do that. Wasted my time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Honestly u shouldn't need pro to do the other stuff it should just be one big thing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Is ok but there should be resources available without asking for money and free backrounds please!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was pretty good but do you think you could make sound free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't add audio and I can't play back my movie when I'm done this app used to be great now it suckssss."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome get this now everyone its great all i need now is playdo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"VERY GOOD useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This makes me sadüñï"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I bought the pro version and I am very happy with it. The one thing I'll say is the erase tool needs to have a softness slider. It's really difficult (mostly impossible) to make shadows look good when erasing. Also it would be so much easier in general to erase things and have it look good if the brush was softer."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"So I do love the app but it would be cool if it was if you could add one more but then it is like an erased button so like you can make people jump without the pro version overall I think it's a good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very good app! I made a while bunch of stop motion vids and they turned out great! The app is very fun to use and works very well. But my one problem is that when I try to share one of my videos ot does not worküòï. Other than that, I love this app and I can't wait to make more stop motion videos!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I'm so sorry to say this but it's not cool Idk Know the controls (lol why did I say that?) Important thing is that idk and that's all to Say.. :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is the best stop motion app you can make a Stop motion video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"No es √∫til para importar archivos, a menos que pagues 99 pesos, no es una app que saque de apuros"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great for people who want to use this for basically any stop motion art but if u want all the good things then u should get the pro version 5 dollars after taxes but even if u dont get pro version it is still an add mazing app it is not a waste of timeüëåüëåüòâ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I paid for the extra options, and it's definitely worth it. There are more options than it seems like at first. I don't know why there is also a ""Pro"" version that's nearly identical, but offering those features as an IAP with this would be nice so I could just have one app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app and its free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You literally have to pay for doodles on your animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is amazing :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its so fun to use."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I HATE THIS APP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING I CANT TSKE IT ANYMORE"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I bought this in June and worked fine then and now it won't let me do anything."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was amazing I made videos of my dolls it was great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's fun I like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bought the premuim features then the app un-installed itself and i lost my work and the feature's very dissapointing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The worst i cant even flip the camera around this sucks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! I have been an animator for years and this app is an animator's haven. Surprisingly, everything that a beginner would need is free! I have a YouTube channel on which I post Lego stop motion videos, (as my name suggests!) and I use this app for that, and have to say, it is fabulous! I have bought the pro version! Definitely worth it! And the price is low too! Everyone can try the free version and buy the paid one of they need it! Kudos to the development team at cateater!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"A really cool app! I began my journey in the stop motion animation world and I am pleased with the result. And it's worth to pay in order to have the premium version of the app üòÉ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I could not name my projects"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its lagy and the quality makes the video look blurry"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The app is great. I see a lot of 1 star reviews saying that you can't send the movie anywhere. You have to click the share button and then click ""save as"". Then you name it and it is in your gallery. Now you can share it. I hope this helps."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It so beutiful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It gives you tutorials I can't even do. I wanted to do a transition or add an image, it needs you to pay. If they change the features you have to pay to do to no pay to do, I will change this to 5 stars. For now, I wait."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Awful app. They just think they can get away with lying through their teeth about the export functions. It is impossible to attach anything to an email , upload to youtube or end through messenger. This would be ok by me if the app didnt insist on lying about what it can do. Dont download this app it has wasted so much of my time with its lies."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, amazing for free, but well worth a fiver for upgrading to the extra features of ""Pro"". Top tip: just make sure you have a good support (eg tripod mount) for your phone/tablet for any stop motion/time-lapse app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love stopmotion some much i did it every day never stop"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I paid for the app my money is been deducted from my account even I got a message regarding the transaction still not getting upgraded"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I used this app a lot. But when today i want to make a mini stop motion movie I go to the filming section and want to start filming it shows an icon that says the cammera is locked. Tell me why? And please fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The app is probably the best stop motion app but does have a lot of bugs. You can't really download the video to your phone cause then in the middle of the video it just stops to work and that means you can't send the video to anyone. Once the end of a video that took four and a half hours to make was just deleted automatically. I think they just want to get money cause all the good features are in the pro version of the app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I can not download but i had it before and loved it on my old phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is what I need Thanks for making this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good üôÇ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Seriously horrible. Have to pay $6+ just for this?? What a scam. Just looking for a good platform to make stop motion videos on, is that too hard? Have you heard of something called ads? Perhaps include SOME ads and remove this trash premium service?"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its great for stop motion but they ate some down falls"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is great so i would give it a 5 star rating but ive found a bug that ruins the experience. For some reason when i try to name my work and try to play it afterwards, it just sorta flickers for a while and doesn't work after all. My friend found a technique to play it but it be really cool if you could actually play it in the actual app, for now i will rate it 4 stars, fix this bug, and i will rate it 5 stars."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"That app is amazing and you can't find better than stop motion studio . It helps me alot with my Lego movie . Thank you stop motion ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Awful. Litteraly everything costs money, I am trying to make stop-motion videos on YT. And this app is not good. You have to pay money for even adding in pictures or videos! This is awful. Don't install a waste of storage. EVERYTHING costs money!! If you want to make your videos with having to pay anything, I don't recommend. I've been trying to install apps that would be good. I recommend Mymovie, they have a lot of great free features, but they do have in-app purchases. This app sucks. >:("

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app with amazing user experience. With my kids, we're having a blast with it. My gratitude goes to the authors, thank you!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The reason why i give this 3 stars is because when i saw my stop motion video it was to fast and didnt look great like the other stop motions on youtube so im gonna try to take more time on my video to see if its still fast or not And also i cant even export it so pls fix it if you can"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You have to pay 5 bucks to be able to import photos from gallery"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really good, but unssuported in most of the hardware I was trying using."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing I really enjoyed it and it was so fun making my movies"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I really enjoyed the app, but I could use some help. I got a new phone, and on my old phone, I had a really big movie, with about 2000 frames in it. When I transferred it to my new phone, it became a video, and everytime I try to upload it to this app, it says it doesn't recognize the format"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible!!! It wont let me download the video to my video files"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for people that dream to be a movie director and it's great! There's only one thing that is wrong with the app. When I finished making my movie I tried spamming the ‚ñ∂ button and then it was glitched, now it's just loading endlessly and when I try to go back it only made it worst. If you respond to this it will be very greatful if you fix it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I would give five stars if no pro or cheaper pro but until then 3 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I first i thought it was free I was making a video and then I was going to add a photo and stuff and I realized it's not free you know I'm only 10 right I can't buy anything?!?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"My son uses my phone alot and once he found out about stop motion he keeps buging me so I got the app and now i can have peace but overall the app is great for keeping kids occupied"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Because its useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I was not able to add photos in earleir project. Since photos could not be sorted by ""name"". In the ""import photos"" from phone storage option if I get an option to sort photos by date, name and size I would give 5 stars."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"At first, I would've given a 5 star review. It used to be amazing. Keyword: ""used"". My brother played for all the premium effects (which are amazing btw buy them) and now I have a new tab A. So, I assumed that the google family sharing would work, like my phone, but now it doesn't. I'm not sure if I'm complaining to the app, or Google. I. Reinstalling it now. Hope it works."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app. I bought the pro version but I'm not sure if it is attached to my account or not. Furthermore, it'll be even greater if there is 1 more button ""previous frame"" while editing each frame. Now it's just ""next frame"" the only option. #update There's a bug in ""erase"" feature. The app wouldn't allow me to reach to the bottom of each frame when i try to erase because of the black bar. Please fix it!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid for upgrade but app not updated to pro version and now asking for payment again for pro upgrade"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very NOICE"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"A while back this would have been a 5 . However like some of the other reviews the last update has screwed things up. I too can't transfer or export projects . And when it does, it takes an age but then jumps and misses out frames when you go to watch it. Please guys try and sort these matters out. Thanks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Stupid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS APP! You will not be able to export to a device or the internet. Waste of money. They'll draw you in with pretty videos and promises, but you will not be able to export any video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really good for stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"No onion layer. I need it to even do SM animation."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a REALLY great app, I recommend it to anyone who wants to make progressional movies! Someone already said how to save it to your device, so If you're wondering how to delete it here's how: go to the homepage where all the vids are, press and hold the one you want to delete then click the trashcan icon. Hope this helps!‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I just wanted to answer some people's questions. So someone gave it one star because they didn't know how to save it to their device. Here's how: go to the homepage where all the vids are at, and press and hold the one you want to save. There's gonna be a share button (looks like a little v) click that. It's gonna say export movie, press that. Then click ""save as."" It will export the vid. Then it'll take you to downloads, click download. Now it's in your gallery! Hope this helped!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This a an AMAZING app! Take it from an AG (American girl YouTuber, channel is called Hcneybear) this is great! I make a lot of stop motion videos for my channel, and this app is the only app I need. Favorite part is, it has it's own personal camera. So I don't need to waste storage space taking photos, I can take them on the app and save them without them going to my gallery and taking up space. It has SO many professional tools like voice over, add photos, and more. 10/10 recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app perfect for lego stop motions. Only downfall is that you have to pay for better stuff"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can set frames per second upto 30 which is good. However Cant transfer project to any device. Saves only in the app. Sending thru Bluetooth did not work, email did not work, messenger did not work. I dont know how you can create a stopmotion project with this app if you cant share the project. 0 star for me. Uninstalling now."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I Was Trying To Make A Beanie Boo Stopmotion It Took Me 3 Day's And I Could Not Upload It I Tried Hours To See What Was The Problom Then All Most Fixed It And BOOM It Said You Need Pro To Use This App For ‚Ç¨4.99 You Will Love It And I Was Mad Dont Download This App........"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"But how to add music is iron horse"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I bought a few things which cost about $4.00 and since the new update has came out, it deleted all of my purchases. Otherwise, I like this app because it is easy to make videos."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app l first discovered it at my school and now got it on my ipad making a lot of cool animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It seems like a somewhat acceptable app, but it's absurd to me that I cannot import pictures without paying, when that's one of the most basic things you should be able to do."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its beautiful made everything but my problem is i cannot share it its so sad... üò£üò£üò£"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I've used this app since app since 4th grade and so far it works pretty well"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like the app it's great but the reason I gave 4 stars is because users have to pay to get all of the credits and sound and green screen but good app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was amazingüòÉ"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really good I recommend!!.üòÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great for Short stuff olny"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a good app whenever i am bored i use this to make my busy it is good it may be harder than animation because of camera position and focusing it may get bad but is not everytime bad it is a good app it can help small youtubers but whenever i record my voice in it or add song it does'tn work please do something"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The reason why i gave this a 2 star is that 1.it is easy to use and other is the money asking pls fix i will not be happy at all"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Because this app dosen't download I have kept it downloading for one hour and also my network is good then also üò°it is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very bad app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Reeeally disapointed you can't even import your own photos without paying 5$. It seemed like a great app, but the quality of the camera of taking pictures isn't the best so I had pre-taken pictures then it told me to pay up. I wish this was a free feature. Maybe I'll consider buying it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It freezes the download at 52"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its the best app. I use this app for my YouTube Videos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great. Just great. It is easy for begginers and i love all the features on the full version. C :"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Buggy as F. Won't focus where you want, fixed focus/exposure is broken and switches back to autofocus at its own will. Some on screen controls appear to do nothing and the help menu does not explain all features, just the ones on that screen. Basically unusable on new Redmi Note 8 pro, even more broken on old tablet (crashes it)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I'm a noob at this but it is really easy to learn."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I think it is the best stop motion app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I is going app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a good game but took 3 hours to install and membership is a little to expensive for me but other than that it is great (edited :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is awesome but the controls are difficult to under stand but it is good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this game. But what keeps me from putting in five stars is that you cannot save your clip if you fix this I will put in five stars"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's not bad and also I'll sacrifice my own life for Pakista"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app! It just needs a bit more tools such as a motion blur or bloom otherwise great! It'd be great if there were a real focus part for when you take photos, because it's really annoying to try and focus by pressing the screen 40 times to get nowhere."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"There are too many options and it is super confusing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Woe"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY...NOT WORTH IT AND THEY WILL NOT REFUND. The green screen and the blue screen, which is why I bought it, are very glitchy and did not work well for me on my google chrome. Don't make the mistake i did and buy the ""premium"". Developer has no interest in customer service as I raised my concerns with them and they denied me a refund. Save your money for a program that works better."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I am giving it 4 rating as you have to buy pack but otherwise it is very nice , easy to use , lot's of operations to make animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is amazing üëç i am telling you you have to download it to make amazing stop-motion videos you just have to practice to make the video smooth and the camera quality is excellent"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Impossible to understand"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good for you"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Blurs or reduces picture size way too much. Google photos has an anamation feature that's better than the paid version of this app. Kinda a bummer. Wish I hadn't bought it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"If everything is for buying many people won't download your app they will think waste of time so if you remove the buying option and you will keep for free Trillions of people will download do this work soon"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"My sis show me the video and it was amazing and very cute ...... And the video was perfectly fine so I don't know what you mean the video quality is not good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great but what's keeping me from putting 5 Stars is that whenever I try to download a video it lags and doesn't properly download them and the video lags so much."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Guys this is worth it go download tjis super cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good I made many animations"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"LET ME INSTALL THEN I WILL GIVE REVIEW"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I don't like this app because you have to buy everything and sometimes to get a movie movie right when you do your own movie it goes on fast mood üò©ü§îüòîüò§"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to buy everything! So ANNOYING! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a very fun app to play on, because you can make mini movies. üòçüòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Fantastic ty"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Good app, but atleast music should be free.why even basic things u need to buy?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Better make this as premium apps so people who have downloaded not disappoint, this app don't even have a demo, use basic feature at first time is not available & must purchase first."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is great but to have control of my account. But it works"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is so ugly its make me angry pls fix this app i have an space to my phone but that app said idont have an space plsss fix this and i will change my rate"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good but takes a lot of space"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The app is good for stopmotion. But it's missing some features that the apple version had. There was a feature to modify your voice inputs and add effects to them. But this version doesn't have that? If some features were added I would give it a better rating."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Have to PAY to buy EVERYTHING üò≠üòûüòî"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Ok? I gueess it could be cheaper"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You shoudl makeb it free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It deserves way more stars than it has. I'm buying pro soon, but even the free version is great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because half the time when you click on something that doesnt have any sign of being a Pro feature, it brings you up to that screen. Ignoring that detail, I definitely recommend this as your stop motion app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Movie Stop motion"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Back then, you didn't have to pay money to put your voice in it or to add effects. I dont know why they changed it to this but it needs to go back to being free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"When first using this app, it was a tad confusing, but once you get the hang of it your good to go!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"better appüëçüëç"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Looks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good üëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is cool but you litrally have to buy everything! I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE FREE"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Please let it be able to record audio into and don't delete anything after updating"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It saves as mpeg 4 but doesn't open in most softwares. Can't do anything in the free version. Waste of time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Some features should be made free...no clips are available for free... it's disappointing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible I have to pay 5 euro just to use my own camera ? Lol can't even tap the button to take a photo on this apps camera without it showing my finger ???? ( Which my camera doesn't do )"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I would give this app 4 stars but there is this one infuriating glitch where when I try to play a stop motion, the loading bar just keeps flashing and it never loads. Please fix this in the next update and then I will bump this up to 4 or 5 stars."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good app there is everything i wanted but photos i take to make stop motion they apper in my garelly so they get in the storage? But other stop motion app does not do that... And pls make the packs free"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"When I add an audio clip it distorts during the video. And I don't know how to resolve this. Also, when I change the Frimes/Second lets say from 8 to 6 and then back from 6 to 8, it increases or decreases the length of the video. If it was a 30 second clip on 6FPS, changing it from 6 to 8 and then back to 6FPS, will make it a 40 seconds clip..."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it wont install"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like this, because it's really easy to understand. The only problems that there are is that when you put text in (for the five pound extras) it only exists for that frame, and there doesn't seem to be any way to make if last for more time without moving it. I also found it hard at first to export it to YouTube."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is good but when the stop motions don't let you do anything when it is one minute long"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Inside there's an option to buy so you can use many features. but turns out this app is a scam. because it's beta. I want my money back and get the stop motion pro!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Goods. 1. reliable 2. Voice recording when film is shown. 3. Camera quality is great compared to the rest. 4. Amazing editing techniques. 5. Other things I can't fit. Not so goods. 1. In app purchases are worse than on score creator, but at least they didn't overprice it. 2. Nothing else. I don't care about advanced editing, since there's softwares like kinemaster and videoleap. But there are things that those softwares don't have, so. Overall, great app that makes your films stunning. 10/10."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app became terrible since the last update. The fact that the audio has been set premium disappoints me. It's giving me lots of trouble to export a movie. The photo quality is horrible even if it's set on HD. Also why is the Remote Camera option premium, BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO PAY TO TAKE A PHOTO FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE? Too bad. It was the most useful app for Stop Motion Animation."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to pay in order to use photos from your gallery."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Kenapa mau impor foto dari galeri ke app saja mesti bayar"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Aplikasi yang sangat bagus, sangat mudah membuat stop motion video dengan ini, namun saya mengalami kendala dengan remote bluetooth / tombol headset tidak bisa berfungsi sebagai tombol capture. Saya menggunakan aplikasi yang sudah saya bayar dengan gadget oppo F11. Saya akan memberi bintang 5 apabila bisa mengambil foto dengan tombol headset / remote bluetooth."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"One of the best stop animation apps.. Makes animation really easy .."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"We have to.pay to add images"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Brilliant! The interface is simple and easy to get a grip of, making it easy to make stop motion! My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to have ""onion skinning"", which helps you see where the last frame was."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! But I found a bug where sometimes a soundbite will get choppy for no reason at certain intervals in the stop motion movie"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Well everytime I try sharing it the file my email says ""Unable to attach file."",And the same thing happened with the others"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I HAVE TO PAY FOR PHOTO ADDING?! THIS IS SUCH A CRAPPY GAME I WILL RIP YOUR LIMBS OFF."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Just randomly deleted over 30 minutes of hard work would not recommend"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I wish you didn't have to pay for some of the things"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app and use it for all my stop motions but it would be better if this app was an account so you could log into your stop motions from any phone, and stop motions could be saved on the cloud. Also it would be better if with green screen and blue screen you could just edit the frame and add the backround instead of having it in frame. Great app, but it could be better."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When I make a video/ movie I can't upload it on YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"What the,i cant say it in words"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Perfect for making lego stop motions as the lego movie 2 stop motion app is having a bug. The other thing is that when you move some thing it won,t leave a shadow behind can the people who make this app add that please, also it takes so long for the camera to shoot, and also the app keeps telling me stuff I already know"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"it was an incredible app. But i cant donwload my videos. I dont know what button will I press to sacr my own first video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's an excellent, affordable app which has transformed my teaching! I love it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The whole reason why I wanted this app is simply because I wanted to animate images (screen shots) but it's very hard to do that when you have to pay for a simple feture, witch made it completely useless. I don't recamend this, I think it's a better idea to make a simple feture free, and i think that it's just trying to take your information, since most apps don't have it this cheep, they often have it more than a dollar, please make it free, or don't take people's information. Don't get this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is trash"

This can be a problem when making a video. Please fix it. Update: I have found a small way around this glitch and that is to play the video at the one frame ahead of the beginning and if you export the video the glitch is gone. I would still recommend getting this app because it is still a good app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"No matter how far or close I go in im trying to add more quality but it keeps going blurry. I'm trying to make a good video! But your blurry camera is stopping me. And dont tell me to clean my camera I DID and NOTHING HAPPENED"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cannot install,always rejects me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Simple but professional... üëç Not yet tried the paid ver though."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I wanted to use this app to create a video with pictures I took on a different device, but to import pictures, you have to pay a fee."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"A good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Dowloaded the app and purchased audio feature but songs aren't playing well at all not worth it at all"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a great first app for making stop motion videos. The free features are just what a young child needs to have fun exploring video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Well..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Looks promising but everytime we tried to create a movie the camera was just black. Occasionally it worked (not sure how or why) but then if we tried to remove a shot and carry on again the camera wouldn't work again. Disappointing!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I BOUGHT THE ""unlock >ALL< features"" AND I CANT F...ING ERASE. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When I use this aap, I saw most of the things are primium...üíµ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Never use this app it takes money for everything I is a *glitch"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for my video!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty cool i guess but it totaly bummed me out when it said you have to pay 22 pounds for special efects and when you take pictures and then watch your skit it plays much to fast my eyes can't even follow the pictures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app from expierience is terrible. I dont recommend the app to anyone looking to make a good stop motion. The camera that you take photos with switches of half way through and isnt fixable. I'd been working on a stop motion for days and was devasted when the camera had switched of. I was so upset i clicked everything to see if i could fix it and i couldnt. It came to the point where my only option was to uninstall the app and lose all of my stop motions. I very sadly unistalled it. AlexaDawe"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Buena esta la aplicaci√≥n"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good so fun I made lots of YT videos with this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it's a very good app to use if you want film!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"No ability to crop the photo. No ability to reset frame edits. No ability to even export taken photos, so you have to shot again to switch to another app. Don't waste your time on this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"YOU NEED TO PAY ‚Ç¨1 TO INPORT PHOTOS FROM YOUR GALLERY DO NOT INSTALL"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love your app, thanks! Recently I purchased a few additional actions and found a little drawback in ""add images"" action - when I add a 9:16 photo with a portrait orientation the app adjusts it to the frame size and crops the top and the bottom of the image. It would be suoer nice and handy to have the ability to place such photos without changing their aspect ratios ü§îüôÑ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Simply like made from EA company. You totally need to pay for use this app. Only 20% are free in this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Eh it's alright üòÇü§£üòÖüòêüòê"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Okay"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really fun, but everytime I try to export what I make the file exports as text and not a video unless I try and export it 10 times in a row."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is the same review written as the last person Alexa Dawe. ( Just on a different device ) part 2 - after I reinstalled the app I clicked on it to start a brand new stop motion and the exact same thing happened I couldn't make pictures or videos the camera was turned off and you couldn't turn it back on.So I deleted the app and then installed it again. The same thing happened. And again and again. Very upsetting.I can't use the app anymore and now I have to find a brand new app. DONT GET APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"My children and I adore this app! Makes creating stop motion Lego videos very easy! I DON'T agree with other reviewers about the ""pay for"" features... They are NOT too much, and can all be purchased in a bundle for a low cost. Individually bought they would, but u can see the benefit of this if u only wanted one. We used the free version of the app for almost a year, as that is feature rich in itself. Bought the pro package once I realized my kids were using it. Mighty worth it in my mind!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I really like this game it's fun and it's easy but you need a lot of patience to get through it all the one complete I have is I don't know how to share it on text or how to post it on YouTube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I've download this app and it's a good app just it takes a long time to download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I installed this app on one plus 7pro but there is no click button icons which comes on the right side of the screen, i re installed it multiple times but still the some, how can i solve this problem?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The audio editing aspect of the app is an absolute joke."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app for my daughter school project paid the extra $4.99 so we could import images, not user friendly at all with no directions as to how to fully use the app. It downloads the images out of the way the you are downloading. piece of junk"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Hello, I recently just deleted a project of mine, is there any way I could recover it?? Thanks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Waiting for it to download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I found it good so far... Could have been better if it's focus is not all over the place"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I've used this app a long time back and it was fine. I installed this again today, however I can't see any option to add or take photos. It's a complete waste if I can't even take a photo!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The pictures are always blurry"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is easy to use and i like the loop timer for the pictures because you can jump at the perfect time and make it look like you are floating"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Dirty"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I lost a file... is there any way I can retrieve it?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is osum"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app is great the best i have seem for stop m Motion I've been using this since 2018 or early 2019 and I've loved it and there's nothing wrong with it a lot of people features you do have to pay for it but the actual stop motion part you don't so it's super nice Sorry if this is long"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You should give errase option or any one option free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"EVERYTHING IS PREMIUM!! THEY RUINED AN APP WITH SO MUCH POTENTIAL!! I CANT ADD MY OWN AUDIO OR PICTURES!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOUR WILLING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY USEFUL. THIS IS AIMED PRIMARILY AT THE DEVELOPERS, WHO I HOPE ARE READING THIS. YOUR APP IS GREAT, BUT YOU CARE MORE ABOUT PROFIT THAN APP INTEGRITY. DISGRACEFUL!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this app. I've always wanted to be a movie maker and now I've entered my first steps to become one. Thanks cateater !!!!!!!!!!üòÜüòÉüòÜüòÉüòÜüòÉüòÜüòÉüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüé¨üé¨üé¨üé¨üé¨üé•üé•üé•üé•üé•üé•üëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"it really good but you can't share to tik tok and youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"it ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's great but it would have been better if the older features such as name details and the feature to see other people's work. I miss those features."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Its not so good the controls are hard, the camera is bad and if you need features you have to pay."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"So it was working well until for some reason a random animation wouldn't load. I have no idea how this happened but I wish to have my animation back."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's a good app and I liked it alot it had great functions and I worked on a stop motion for my little sister for a couple of days only when I went on it later in the evening every thing was fine in the morning every single stop motion had been deleted I did not do anything and no one has access to any of this I am absolutely heart broken and the help section didn't even help"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great fun, I haven't paid for anything as what you can do is good enough for me, have made funny videos with my kids and you can add voice overs. Ideal and easy for beginners."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Broken AF The app is super laggy, and the screen is extremely dark and blurry. And whenever you hit a button, the screen freezes for 5 secs. And sometimes the option to take a photo outright dosen't work. And even if you don't hit a button, the screen still freezes regularly."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. Mr Four loves making stop motion movies!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Not a bad app overall. Very ideal for simple projects, but need tk.pay for more features to make more professional-like stop motion video which is a bummer. The worst part is that everytime I try to export my video, it either does not show up or does not get converted to an mp4 file. Please fix this!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"There is one problem for me. When ever you delete all the frames it makes the screen plain black"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Too many things are pay to use! I can't even upload outside images"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Easy to use, but the exported mp4 is unplayable on my chromebook. I can't play it in drive, either. Fix this! It makes the software useless."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good. Is there a way to retrieve an accidentally deleted movie? ü§îü§îü§î"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a very good app but the problem is most of the stuff is to pay for a membership it would be nice if a few thing could come out of the membership so I rate it 4 stars"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I spent 1.29$ to stop motion animate ONE second of footage for a video I'm working on but of course, this app doesn't save these as video files to google photos and drive so I can't import it to davinci resolve. Absolutely terrible app and I want my money back."

When I add a song, it makes it sound fuzzy. The song will be fine until I add it into the app. Honestly makes me wish I hadn't paid for the app."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I made a awesome stop motion vid and ot was cool"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I JUST downloaded this app... and it's annoying me... consider an easier gui and a shortcut or something... SOMETHING to mute that terrible noise everytime you take a pic... for that reason alone I wont use it. It's not a complicated system to design an app around. Design to be friendly... edit... I paid for the full version, and I'm still annoyed. Why can't I edit in portrait mode... especially if my frames were captured in portrait mode."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have bin making stopmotions and it's pretty cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like the app but what I don't like about it is that the sound effects and background music costs money. At least the pictures, timer and other stuff does not cost any money."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Too much paying features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is very very nice to kids this app is amazing install it now üëçüôåüëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is great for my LEGO animations."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I' ve been using for three years. It's journey was outstanding. I was thrilled for how the trains wete mlving on it's own!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible and they want money for EVERYTHING."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Works as it should, like it a lot."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I can do what ever animation I want"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"rlly We have to pay to import images. WRYYY"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great fun and lots of sophisticated tools"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is great. You can turn pictures into video's and it's great fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Probably a good app but it is not compatible with my OnePlus 7T."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I wish there were more effects barley and but great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I loooooove this app sooo much i would give it a thousand stars if i could"

It is so annoying when everytime I try to create a new project I click on the camera icon and that stupid window pops up forever, and even when I hit ""done"" it still redirects me to the same bloody window"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is very good exept that I can not save my movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This sucks! I can not even turn the camara around!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Incluso para importar fotos hay que pagar. Seg√∫n la instal√© la desinstal√©."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything needs to be paid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best app for stopmotion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Wasted"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Have to pay for basic items."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Worth every penny. Works like a charm. I think negative reviews are from people confused about free vs. paid features. Only thing I'm missing is sound triggered camera. And remote camera feature is to slow to be usefull."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is exceptional. For only a free app, I'm pretty impressed with what I can do."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"A dummy gummy. Everything ,they are saying to buy with cash. It's time waste and memory waste. Please don't download it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Needing to pay just to import damn pictures is absurd. Not great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good app i had no problems with it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Such a cool app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have tried to install this on my oneplus 7pro multiple times. However on starting the app, I don't see the option to click and add pictures. I see the text saying 'Tap here to add some pictures' and an arrow pointing to the right hand side suggesting that there would be certain buttons but on my device, I see that section is blank (no buttons) Ironically, I tried this app on two more phones (different models) but the app works fine there Can you confirm if Oneplus-7-pro is compatible?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"HORRILE IT DOES NOT WORK"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't even get things from your gallery.........."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Trash it took my money on spending it for 4k when it did nothing Dont download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I love this app, dont get me wrong, but I dont like how the pictures take longer to process when you take over 100 pictures. Also I dont like how you cant edit your videos allot. AND it's super confusing on how you save the video to your phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a pretty good app üëå but I wish I didn't have to pay for editing and all that :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best ever"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I dont know Just Rating"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! So easy to use and so much fun. Best animation app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The green screen is glitchy and the adding of audio did not work. I wasted my money on the Bundle. Expected more from good app. :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"As a newbie it doesn't give you any instructions what to do. It seems to go straight to adding photos. Disappointing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very impressive I got into stop motion by a Youtuber called Kristen stensile because his zombie apocalypse videos encouraged me"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good app thank you for the simplicity love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"App is pretty good, but after a few weeks the quality got worse, so I bought the 4k quality and it had no difference from the regular HD, and the 4k just made it laggy. But overall it was pretty good for a free app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great game but can you make the pro one free thank you"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! Works on any device, and is extremely clear! I like making LEGO animations with it and it's the best app you could ever wish for!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Extremely fun!!!üòÑüòä‚ò∫"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its great but, you have to pay for the good stuffüôÑ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Can't take a photo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Works but to exspensive The photo taking works great and the features that it lets you have work good too, my only issue is that i cant tell if the other features are good BECAUSE THEY ALL COST MONEY"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was really very enjoying I loved it üëçüîõ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amzing 10 out of 10. The only thing is that i wish you can do more without having to pay but its still a great stop motion app.üëåüëåüëåüôÉüôÉ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for everything and if you accidentally delete your video, you can't even retrieve it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It doesn't install"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Love it but i want it to save to youtube üò¶"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This has really helped with my stop motion skills. I have made many superhero films and television shows (even though the app is made for movies). The premium package helped, with drawing, titles and credits. Definitely one of the best stop motion apps I have come across."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's dumb you have to pay for everything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great! Lots of fun for my son and me. It is worth to buy all features for a small fee. Very happy I found this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great, except for one thing! When choosing green screen feature, wether blue or green, other colours end up being picked or blacked out as well, so far I've noticed black, white and grey are affected! Please address that issue! Otherwise it's quite and interesing app, and most of the criticisms I've read are simply because the users haven't understood how to use the features, it's actually not problems with the app features! Simple YouTube tutorials quickly taught me the ropes!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's fun! Play with it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This vedio i"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Terrific"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"You guys should really download otherwise you'll never find a all good as this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Litterally cant do anything without hitting paywall"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really nice. Let's you see previous frame. Cant add music or text without paying but what are you going to do? The creators need money for there work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"VERY GOOD! Though you cant save the videos and I would like it if someone helped, and told me how."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's good amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a good app, don't get me wrong. It does what it says it does. However, you have to pay for most of the features (Not expensive but money is money that I don't wanna spend.)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this! It is a amazing app to use when you want to make a video without so much complex things! 5 stars for me!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Help! When I try to export my movie to Google drive or email, it sends as just text that says Created with Stop Motion Studio."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's too. Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Very bad user experience. I could not find way to render my video."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best to make movies."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Really great app! I bought the full version and it has so many features. One problem though; maybe it's because my animation is long, but when inserted into the project, audio clips cut & glitch out. I tried exporting the video and it saved like that as well. Still the best app I've downloaded!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is really fun! Even tough some things you can't do.. But when you have it for a while you will get the hang of it! You should try it. Some might not like it but I do! It is really awsome!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's just perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it so so much but the only thing i pretty much dont like is i have to pay tp add sound but its there fault"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great I love it I love using it it makes my life a whole lot easier."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a great app and ive made 2 little shorts and im making a big movie right now. Only complaint it the frames are a bit dark but i mean that could just be my camera i have an older android. But anyway great app and i plan to keep using!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is a great stop motion app. But with my recent film I made, it would not load and it would just say ""stop motion studio has stopped."" Over and over. And I could only watch the other vids I made, and not the recents. It has a hard time loading overall."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Quando salvo/exporto a vers√£o final do meu v√≠deo, n√£o aparecem as imagens, s√≥ o som. O que eu fa√ßo??"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"My sister downloaded the app before I did. She made so many cute videos! In the your videos part(right next to where it says ""new video"" it shows all of your videos. It would only show 5 at a time even though she had made like 13 videos. Then she was devastated when she noticed that her very first video(her favorite) somehow got deleted and wouldn't show up. So I am worried that when I go and make videos they will delete. Help?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Credits are important, see you need to know who made the movie if you're sharing it with friends."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I spent 1 hour making a vidoe to upload on youtube and when I finished The app updated and then I couldn't upload to youtube because the update doesn't let you this is just over all no that good you need money for everthing basically."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love stop motion video because you can experience a lot of things"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is realy good, but the only thing that I dislike about it is that there are no shadows of the previous frame, making it harder to make smooth animation, that's the only dislike I have about the app, it it had this feature, this would be a 5 star."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love it so muchüòäüòäüòä"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Why do you have to pay for green screen , drawing, and uploading images hope the makers reading this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have only one issue with this app: while taking pictures, you cannot see previous frames. Please fix!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Whenever I make a 1 minute long animation, it does not load after I press the play button to see how I did. Please fix that."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It is okay, but you have to pay to import pictures."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Sucks that they trick you to think it has some free options but i can even import pictures without spending money."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Confusing interface. Can't use in portrait mode. Already paid full on my iPad, does not let me register and use on my Samsung phone.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Simpel and effective"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Irritating that all features except basic creation have to be paid for. Cant even export or share a basic animation. This doesn't motivate me to give it a good trial and maybe upgrade when happy with it."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its really good with the effects and stuff"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"great app but took ages to download and install but overall great app the other thing why it isnt getting 5 stars is that it was quite basic i was using it to create my drama prodject but it was hard to upload to my teacher and also the editing features are quite basic so i had to put it on a different app to edit it . but if you just want to make a simple annimated movie i say this app is quite good exept it taken ages to load but that might just be my computer ."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'm older yet I've now got it on my phone so good just the things for animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Just a money grab app. It works and all, but I'm not paying money just to add pre taken pictures. It makes you pay to add pictures unless you take them through the app. This is some real EA games money grab bullsh- PLEASE PAY $999999 TO READ THE REST OF THIS REVIEW"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Why I need to pay for full version cannot add music what the heck I don't recommend this app waste of storage"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing! I have just one problem. My stop motion animation keeps trying to download the new pictures so i can run the animation but it keeps reloading and doesnt ever complete the process so I can actually project the animation.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice! App for lego and clay motion !!*"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Love the app, so fun to make videos and watch them with friends and family, except for one thing if you make a mistake or accidentally take a photo you can not delete it. Also every other photo you take it's either way too dark or way too light. I hope you can fix this because other than that I really like this app, I've already made five videos and this happened every time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its OK but its annoying that I cant add sound I dont really wanna pay to just add a noise I would much rather watch an ad to get that sound but overall easy to use."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This is a great app but there's a few changes and features I would love to have if your like me then you hate to waste money that's why I think stop motion studio should have the same features as stop motion studio pro i downloaded the app then bought the locked tools but the pro edition has the tools I needed so I say to the developer for the people who bought the locked tools on this app let us have the erase feature and some of the other ones please"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a really helpful app. You can make some pretty cool videos with this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It works like it should, but I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that you have to buy the full version just to delete a frame that you screwed up on. Therefore, if you mess up, you have to start ALL OVER AGAIN."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app, just have to know how to use it Also, has awesome features to improve your movie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice app,I've been using it since 3 years. But I want you to bring back the earphone click feature ,so that it would not shake"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesomely horrible and terrifically terrible"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like the app. It works, and I didnt experience any bugs, its easy to use, but you seriously should add a flash. It is hard for me to make videos if you cant even see some frames. A flash should help. Other than the lighting, its great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great for doing cringy plasticine and Lego animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Said it saved my project to my phone but played nothing."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is amazing and all, but I bought pro features and thought it would give me features from the pro version of the app, but no. I can't do that cool erase thing, so basically nothing can fly, and i generally don't want to waste more of my hard earned allowance money to buy the pro version. Please update this and give it stop motion studio pro features for the people who bought pro tools like me."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I hate it! It deletes my reviews, I can't watch my own videos! Make a app that works."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its was good but"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thanks for invent this type of beautiful app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Have to pay extra just to import an image. Worst app ever."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I tried it and I didnt post it but the quality is amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really really awesome app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This stop motion app is useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Honestly, since you have to pay for everything, its trash. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because, well the animation runs smoothly."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was expecting. I was able to learn how to use it in 2 minutes."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This is app TERRIBLE i had shot an entire film and by the time it was done NOTHING SAVED. Do not install this app, it s better to use the default phone camera."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not a user friendly app. Everything has to be paid before you can use it. Cant even import photos from gallery without paying, cant add sound without paying, cant edit blissfully without paying. Lol pay-to-use app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I deleted Netflix to get this + multiple other apps and it will not download"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love the appüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome yeessss i do stopmtions all the time now"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app sucks I installed it to make a stop animation to put my pictures that I have ready. I have to pay a dollar to import my pics when there are as that do that for free. Don't get this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why i am not able to save the video even after paying??"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The effects are much to expensive and the stop motion making is very hard on a phone. The over all pictures, and theater mode are nice though"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this game,I haven't made a lot of movies ( just one ) but there's one problem, when you want a background, you have to buy it. But most of the time, I like it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its good Its just the camera, its more horrible than glory"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"can be really glitchy some times and over that 10/10 it was made to mak movies and there are apps that are lazy but this a hole othere lev"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I like the app I just dont want to spend a dollar to erase and draw and nearly 35 other things please make it free so I can erase my mistakes"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not satisfied. Can't export movies"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Why does the erase option rotate it not erase it?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Mabey it's my camera but the qualitys bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great but after you have done like only 33 slides it the camera stops working and you can't finesh you movie."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I enjoyed making stop motion videos on this app the only thing I don't like is that for my first movie I wanted to add sound effects other wise it wouldn't entirely make sense but the sound effects and other things like it cost money of course I understand the reason why they cost money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good application for stop motion video And i prefer to use this application"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I payed for the premium and when i re-downloaded it, IT WAS GONE"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Money sucker"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't save my project"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"NO FREE MUSIC SO ANNOYING!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This is good but you NEED to pay money to really make a stop motion movie it's just taking pictures like that's not fun at all maybe you can add more features for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is very fun but you have to pay for everything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great app but it keeps advertising its subscription way to much"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app.me and my sister like to make lego aliens."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its the coooooooooooooooolist stop motion studio"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Everything costs money so no back grounds no editing no special effects .also I wasn't able to get to watch my movie full screen and it wasn't saved in my pictures .so I wasn't very happy about that especially when my brother got this amazing movie maker app that wasn't compatible for my device"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Looks real"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"useless they only want money way back 2 years this app is free but now its a trash ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is good except for one thing that is you have to pay for ereasing things"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I enjoy making my animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I downloaded to make a gacha life animation. I'm normally not allowed to pay for apps, as it is unreasonable to me. So, finding out I have to pay just to import a screenshot, didn't sit well with me. Like, geez. I know it's not much, not at all, just, I feel like a lot of people have looked at this, expecting a free animation app, like me."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't see or click any controller needs a fix"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a great app with a lot of amazing effects. However, if you use those effects too much, the app will crash and delete all unsaved edits."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I have made various videos in this with my Lego figures, and they are all good. My only complaints are that the green screen turns more than just green into the image, and the focusing usually does not work on the first attempt, but still good app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"When I want to flim portrait flims in the app, the preview photo screen still remains 16.9 width"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This has giving me lots of new and exciting ideas for my films üìº. 5 stars because this is the best stop motion app every"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Works great but for the OnePlus 7TPro, it only works with importing images. I'm not able to make the shots whitin the app. The buttons don't display."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You have to buy features but quite proffessional"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good love using it granted I suck at stop motion but it is a very good app and simple to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"So verry disappoited for this appüëéüëéüëé"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"1 tiny problem: I want to save it to my phone but there is no option for it so I would really appreciate it if you updated it so people can save it or at least tell me how to thamks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"There is no text system and proper audio system"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is great, except for every other frame is dark or light and it is making me mad. The solution I've used is to just take 2 pictures of the same thing and delete the one that is the opposite shade I want. Maybe I just don't know anything about photography, but if it's not just me, could you guys at Stop motion Studio please fix this?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great easy to work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I had to pay for everything literally."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You have to by the full version"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Great but strange grey block over buttons on the right on oneplus 7t"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The stop motion is good but it wouldn't been better if it could be free editing because it's kind of hard."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great as always, this app is awesome it incorporates everything you need for a stop motion. Just wish there would be a feature to save it to Your DIRECT camera roll."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good but for some features we've to pay money"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"ahh i hate this app why do you have to buy feuters or why is it so fast and why cant ston motion studio be free im a kid i cant buy stuff with my parents money please make stop motion studio have the timer so its not so fast"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to bye everything!!!!! üëéüëéüëé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Terreble can not export and spent hours on the video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you upload. Pure trash whenever I'm about to upload my animation, it cancels automatically."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app is good. Kinda sucks that you have to pay for features. But the WORST part is the fact that when I download a video to photos it's grey and all you hear is the sfx. It's frustrating because I already made multiple stopmotions without testing it out."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's the best and I also think it's so cool how you can make videos from pictures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever You can't even add images for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Niceüòé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"So it wont stop like mackeing the sound that i did for my videos!but...other then that its a great game!yayyybutawww!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It works good and the features are good, but, I bought the sound effects but some of them dont even work! The ones I would use the most dont work."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sloppy. Outright disappointment. This app could easily be improved if it had an optional mute camera, and a phantom image of the last frame translucently over the next frame. If it could also alternate with realtime recording, I'd give it three stars. If it can also be drawn over to the extent of outright animation where it autocopies frame to frame, Ill give it 5 stars and redownload immediately"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is AMAZING!!! Its has very good quality when you're making it and usually you have to pay to put sounds but in this one you dont. Defintley worth getting it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Most Functional stop motion app, 5 stars rating."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I was thinking of buying the pro version even before using the free version. But then I noticed that the charge is PER MONTH!! The dev must think he is Adobe?! This kind of ridiculous pricing plan only encourages piracy."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best freaking game ever every thing you think of is in this is your choice my cousin got it as well"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's sooooo bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. It gives you the option to see the previous image you took at different levels of opacity, which is helpful if you're doing stop motion!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I would only request for a button to go to end"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its cool and fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love it but it ask me for my email and u guys came in my Gmail WOW"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"One photo takes way too much time to capture."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I cant believe i have to pay to import photos!!!! This makes me very angry"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I wanted to try stop motion and thought this app would do. But it crashes a lot, which would be fine if IT DIDN'T CRASH RIGHT AFTER I WAS DONE TAKING 230 PICTURES AND WORKING ON THEM FOR AN HOUR TEDIOUSLY POSING A DOLL AND IF it didn't save I would be EXTREMELY ticked off. You have been warned."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good for beginners! I enjoyed this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is the bomb!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app! One thing you could fix is minimizing recording bar. Currently, I can't see half of the frame while recording, which is kind of annoying. Thank you!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing. I even have the pro version!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have used the app in other devices and it works great, but now that i installed it in a new phone (redmi not 8) the tool set on the right hand side of the screen just doesn't show/work so I'm stuck."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I hope they add free sound effects"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It won't let me access the camera anymore. I've used this app on other devices and it's never done this. I don't know if there is a limit or anything but I'm kinda dissapointed since I just got it on this device. I'm pretty much happy except for that."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for everything. And the focus is horrible for some reason I uninstallled after a couple of minutes trying to get the focus right, but you don't care because people download this and buy the add ons so..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Can the croetors of stop motion pls let me have stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This app is great, but I wish it were possible to add frames into the middle of the video, or at least switch the order of frames. As far as I'm aware the only way to add frames earlier in the video is to delete all your progress and re-do the later frames, which was really frustrating for me because I made a lot of progress and don't want to have to start most of it again. Please add this function!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great but... How do you upload the stopmoiton video? I'm only asking. plus it's great,awesome,and cool,it is not terrible it's good!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"

Thanks u Cateater Keep a Good Work and Success."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is surprisingly good and I am happy with the stop motions I've made and I hope the ratings go up as I wasnt to keen on getting it when I looked at the star ratings but overall pretty good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Probably the worst experience with an app I've ever had. You can only use half of the screen to record? Forces you to be in hamburger mode? I feel bad because I didn't even get to experience the editing of the app. The UI was so bad I just had to get out and uninstall. Please correct me if I'm wrong because this app seems awesome otherwise"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thas is soooo cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Everything is under paid option, nothing is free is for demo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I had this on a tablet with all of the buyable tools, and none of it transfered over. I don't feel like buying again unless I can't restore the purchase I made."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"So bad import images you have to pay to do so bunch of capitalist inferiors"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's a pretty good stop motion app. It ate up my phone's batteries tho"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good app. Doesn't family share on apple."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I liked it untill one day i was makeing a movie when i tried to use a feature it said i hadent gotten them but 3 months ago i had gotten them forever. Over all good but u got to buy every thing but it is only 4 dollars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Immediate Un-Install. You have to pay $.99 to import your own photos?? Are you kidding me? What a ridiculous pay wall."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is garbage you cannot share to YouTube sucks 0 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I paid money still i am unable to upload image from my phone gallery. I feel betrayed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Learning steps are very difficult"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ü§úü§õüèø"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"My app is recording few seconds now ."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It is a great app. I use it for my WWE stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I gave this app a rating at all because it can actually do things without demanding your money every now and then, but as I said, its ONLY every now and then. I was using this app for a book trailer that I need to make for school. I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to get rid of a background on a picture that I added to another Image with the IBIS paint app, (no solution,) and then once I just decided to embrace the F , I had to pay to import pictures!! Do not get."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"For one of my stop motions, whenever I try to play it, it shows the loading bar, but then it starts blinking quickly. I watched one of my other stop motions and it worked. I don't want to have to reinstall the app because I worked hard on my stop motions."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is nice and smooth"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I could make a movie and let other kids see it if they dont have a T.V ü§ó‚ò∫üòÅ!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I'm making my first video and overall I like this app, but there's a few features that would make it feel more intuitive that I wish were present. Whenever I wanna do a playback and skip or rewind to a certain point, it doesn't do that. I have to pause the playback and then scroll over to the point I want to see, which is really annoying when you're 500+ frames in. I actually got so annoyed with it that I halted the video making process to write this review."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I've always wanted to make my own movies. The app is very easy to use. You can record your own voice. The only thing I have against the app is that you have to pay for the special features."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is wonderful"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Camera never focuses"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Can thg even download do not get"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"it's ight 10 outta 15 would use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a good app and is helping me learn stop motion. Why four stars? The purchases. You need to buy featured sound effects, the ability to draw on frames, import photos from your library, etc. Why? Why ask money for sound effects, other stop motion apps probably don't ask for money."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I used to have stop motion Studio Pro and I tried to reinstall it and it wouldn't let me because I had to pay for it again but I already paid for it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Ok is ok and is speciol"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's good most of the time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"SUPER LAGGY AND ANY THING PAST 5FPS IT BREAKS"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The project I made is not able ro export What do I do?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Icons are missing!!!!!!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing stop motion app! Have made so many awesome films on here!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It wouldnt let me take anymore pictures and just froze up..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Worst.not opening"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Promising, but UI is a disaster on Pixel 4."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't download it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Well I paid the 4.99 feature pack by accident. I tried to refund it but it didn't work Man what a nice move you got there. SCAM"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I have had troubles with voiceovers, but overall, I've had a great time with it! But at times it freezes up. So just exit the pic area, the reopen it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for a while, but it has deleted some of my stop motions that take me days to make which is annoying. üò≤ Thankfully, it has kept the best ones."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is a really good and you can do different things"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much. I made a lego moc and I wanted to make an animation and show so this is what I needed!!! THANK YOU!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for animations L"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't retrieve your deleted files"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I have been working on animation with this app for a while. Then suddenly, everything deletes. There was about 6 hours of drawing put into those videos. Screw this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"AMAZING!its good for learning the basics."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Hard"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Alright"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its, pretty good minus the freezing up from time to time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty nice free app, with upgrades possible for reasonable prices. There is a bug I was going you could fix: when the camera is in mirror image mode, the last-frame overlay needs to be mirrored as well, as it is not useful otherwise. Generally a ""mirror camera input"" option in the settings might help or work around this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is great. It is quick and easy to create professional like animations."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its been 1 hour and its still not installing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"An excellent makes really good üëç videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"üñïüòç"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is great but when I try to watch my films it loads but then after it stops and vibrates so now I can't even see my work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"AMAZING üëêüëêüëêüëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"There is no reason to use this over my phone's built in slow motion. The app does nothing you can't do with every other video editor. The video quality is terrible."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to pay to make an actual stopmotion video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I dislike the fact that you have to pay for everything, and when you buy the green/blue screen, it turns everything into the background"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"üëçüëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Paid for a subscription, still can't even import an image. Scam of an app DO NOT PAY FOR IT!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"All of the icons on the right are missing (Pixel 3 XL). I even uninstalled, download the paid version with the same result. I've added permissions, restarted my phone, & force stopped the app in an effort to get this working. Is there a fix for this?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is avery fun app me and my little sister have so much fun doing it!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"You can make amazing stop motions with this app but some features are paid but it's an amazing app. I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app i have been useing this app since 2017 and i still love it it helped me make some lego stop motions thank you"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love useing this app and i am going to keep it on my tablit naw"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is really useful for stop motion and very accessable!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I use this app to animate all the time, recently I've had this problem though where it takes 2 seconds to process a frame (I've got the S10 so i dont know if that matters or not) whereas on my old phone I could click it and it would take a photo immediatly. If this is fixed then 5 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You didn't let us use it instead you could've put your watermark on the clips."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good it was"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Well it works and its just fine for a low and not that experienced stop motioner :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app!! I do have one concern... I just purchased all the features about 5 months ago and I'm really enjoying making stop motion videos when suddenly I dont have access to any of the features and I'm givin the option to purchase them again. Did it expire?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a good app to make stop motions. Although I'd like you to fix the backwards camera when I put it on rear."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its so perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for making stop motions I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. It really is fun to make stop motion videos in my free time. The problem is that it makes you pay for somethings like the drawing tool. Other than that there is nothing wrong."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Please help me to download this app I can't download this app üò¢üò¢"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for making my animation in infocomnn cca"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't turn on remote camera! I don't now why! Please help!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great you got that right you can do very much stop motion but you need money for the background"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Every feature is behind a pay wall. Uninstalled."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Nothing without you buy the app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a very good app. There is one tiny problem though. Almost every time I make a stop motion film, I always play the film to see if there is any errors. Also I need to mention that there are two ways to watch your film. One of the ways is that you have to wait. Im pretty patient but if your brick/clay film is too long, well it takes like 5 mins or 10 mins fo it to ""PREPARE"" itself so you can watch it. I dont usually use that to watch my film but I always need cause one of the ways freezes!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good app. But i reccomend 2 additional sounds in the audio section. A 'lightsaber ignition' and a 'lightsaber retraction'"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I think it's cool I have used this app before"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"They showed me this in school ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Becuase no play button and capture"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"super great! good to make your own mkovies and all : )"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I made my movie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"But one scratch doesn't save takes to longgggggg"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's ok, but my brother uses it like a pro and I can't even figure it out"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app! This app is easy to use and I got time to make 2 episodes!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I use it to make all my animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its a good app but , You need to pay the most important things of a Stop Motion Movie , like Sound , Editing , and many more! üò¢üòßüò£ Make it all free please!üò†"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome download this app it is ama zin"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You need to fix the stadic in the music! I didn't buy it for nothing!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good but FIX THE FLICKERING PLEASE!!!!!!!!! Even when I ""lock"" the lighting it still changes!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't do ANYTHING unless you buy"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it so much üíñüíñüíñüíñüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I can't export my video to social media or my email. I've tried both. And I paid for one of the features to use this app! I 1st tried email & nothing shows up in the email except ""Created with Stop Motion Studio.: When I try to export the video to FB, there is no attachment! I ALSO tried downloading it to my phone and it is NOT there in my downloads. Can you please advise?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Works fine, until you want to do anything more than take pictures in the app. Then you have to pay. I paid, got the ""extras"" (like adding a title or sound, which are basics in any other app, even the free ones!), but now, a week and a half later, it's asking my to pay again to get the same features. There's no obvious way to contact the developers, either, so there's no way to ask for my money back. A decent app, ruined by greed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like to make movie"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"So cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Cool but not so cool at the same time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its cool, but I would enjoy if more options were available, for instance like selecting frames that you would like to make play faster or slower instead of having the whole animation(movie, short, ext) being all the same motion (frames per sec). Also a feature that allows you to zoom in or out. I hope these will be added to the app. But other than that I enjoy using this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"if you draw online and have to import it costs $0.99"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I love this app BUT WHY CANT I SAVE ANYTHING SO THAT I CAN ACCESS IT FROM A DIFFERENT DEVICE!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I paid for sounds and some don't even work and some of my videos crashed and I can't watch them bad app don't pay for anything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Gr8 app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! But sorry, paying for everything is just not what we need here!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"you have to pay for every thing!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love the app!! It's a little slow, and there are a few things I would improve ( if I knew how!!üòÇ). I left feedback on their email. Thank you to the creators for creating an easy way to create stop motion videos!! üòòüòò"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is, as Christopher Eccleston would say, ' Fantastic! '. Even if you don't know how to use this app, there are ways to learn how to use this app. I oftenly run out of digital space on my tablet, meaning I have to delete my stop motions. Although this isn't a fault of the app. Thank you, Stop Motion Studio."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very usefull Thank ownerbye From pn"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is an awesome app. I just really wish we could use other colors for the green screen. Because some of my lego minifigures eitherhavw blue or green on them and it's very frustrating. I mainly a white back drop so it would be amazing if i could color key the white/grey backdrop. It would be perfect."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Really crazy how you have to pay to import your own photos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Poo"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"TERRIBLE YOU NEED MONEY TO DO EVERYTHING EXCEPT ADD PHOTOS"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Not very good and would not allow me to make any new films."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I say that this is not to hepful i read the instrutions and my animation is still the same (bad) so thefor BAD GUIDES"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It's very boring and it takes a lot of time to install"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this app I use this for making stop motion animation with my toys"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"U ar stupid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"When you set the lighting focus and exposure lock it still changes making a flicker effect. Plus you have to pay for the most basic parts of a stop motion, like audio and filters. this app is highly dissapointing. The app also makes you pay for text, green screen, drawing, and higher resolution. And if you do pay, you can't import frame by frame from the free version. You also can't import photos without paying. The app asks for too much money. The app works well for amateurs and kids though."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"its a good app slightly annoying that you have to buy extras like editor and green screen but they are totally worth it. To make it five stars i would add better green screen because it's okay at the moment but could be better. Overall great app. Thx!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is so cool it worked for my channel"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Very glitchy, sometimes when you take the pictures and go back to it they are gone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cooooooooooooooooooool üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Using of nothing. Too expensive."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It has good potential but I don't like that you pretty much have to buy everything that i can get for free on another app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why is it so much on the optimisation WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best app experience ever! I usually dont write reviews but this app was an exception. Really worth the 5 bucks üëåüëå"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I was make a animation, and I didn't know that the shutter sound has to END then it takes a picture. I HAD 600+ pictures and my hand was in the image so much the whole thing was garbage, and I am RAGING right now. It like it would have looked good, BUT NO, it had to be so delayed. I'm mainly just warning people and raging. Good otherwise (which isn't much)."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i luv tis app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it! It's easy to use and very good to learn how to animate! But there are some cons like the amount of features you buy. But I understand the app is a great app and it took time as it is free so I'm fine as I love stop motion and other animation uses"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awsome!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I like the app but the youtube issue is back... But now Its just so broken I cant watch my stuff not worth installing anymore"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It so annoying on my phone for a dumb project"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy and simple"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to add pictures and instead you have to use the built in camera which is terrible quality. So unless you want poor quality stop motion videos the app is useless unless you pay."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very cool game but takes a long time to take pictures"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its very good good for animating and i see peoplw on youtube use it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I started a photo every day thing and it was going alright, I would have rathered to take the pic outside of the app and import it, but that doesn't happen. Then I'm now getting a new phone and need to transfer the whole file(and individual photos) to my camera roll, however it won't let me do this and I have to screen shot each on eindividually and crop them etc. I have 182 frames Bad features"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was the best app ever for stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Useful for stop motion moviemaking, but it doesn't have an onion skin filter to make stop motion easier."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's exciting"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It's pretty good for me to make Lego stop motion videos but there aren't enough features available please add more"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sux"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"How do I add gun fire/muzzle effect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Alright"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"awesome!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The app is good, it's a bit limited, I purchased the full version but unfortunately when you add a soundtrack to your video it turns out very noisy, only advantage I can see from the purchased version is that you can export in HD , I really hope that the developers will fix the noisy sound track thing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"You can not do a very long stop motion project on this app. Plus you cannot errase, rotoscope, greenscrene, or do anything on this without buying the features. Pretty good, but also pertty bad."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Co founder of the company is or address"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I dont know. I haven't us ed the app yet. I'm just giving pity on them"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have now been inspired to make even my own YouTube video I highly suggest that you should get this game."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I was making a lego stop moton and when i got to 1000 frames and i tried to play the video the app was not able to load."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'm me is the boo ! Poopy shoes yayayyayaya"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great...."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I paid for sound effects and now I can't watch my stop motions"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Je pense juste que c'est la meilleure application en stop motion, c'est tellement amusant de faire des choses avec √ßa! merci beaucoup d'avoir fait cette application !!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice app.. I likeit"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"All in all pretty good app but you have to pay to use the eraser to like take things out of the frame"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Forces you to buy the app if you want to have decent camera quality"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cannot add preexisting photos from Gallery or Media...this is dumb"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"dont like the lighting"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I'm disappointed"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"It's a good app, easy to use. The downside is that you have to pay. At least let me add music to the video without paying for it!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I definitely recommend this app. Out of all the other apps I tried this one was by far the BEST. It is so fun!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best animation app I have ever used"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It takes forever to DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its kind of messed up how I paid for it and they deleted of my phone now I have to download and pay again."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Epic üëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is just locked behind pay walls and wont even let you upload your stuff most of the time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app makes you pay for everything that it mentions in the ad, no good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"very good for stop motion because it does not have any advertising"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love using this app for film making with my Lego figures and my toys and the prices of the things you can buy in the game are very affordable. Also I haven't experienced a glitch yet. Great for all ages and a fun way to spend a Sunday morning."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its really nice, but all the features that cost money really bug me."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I heard that Full Sail University Uses this app, so, congratulations on that!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"DO NOT GET THIS APP! I made a pretty decent mini movie with this app (around 348 pictures) and this app refuses to let me save it. The movie was for a big science project and this app almost made me fail."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It was üòÄ good for me but my friend took the pictures to fast and go to my hand in the photo ü§£üòÇü§£ü§£"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is sooooo fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I don't understand how to start the recording It just shows a recorder with a strike marked on it . I just can't start the the stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Nice stop motion app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app awesome i just wish the sound effects were for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Phone went flat after taking what is estimated to be around 50 photos over 1 hour period, turned phone back on to discover the photos are not saved to the internal storage?! All gone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I guess its good, but I change the speed, and ALL OF MY AUDIO GOES AWAY!! Please fix that! Otherwise, its pretty good..."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best animation in the world"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Whoever is saying that they hate this app so it means they dont know that how to use this app they are noobsüí© first someone needs to guide themüòëüòëüòë."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app is inconsistent at best. I own the full version on 3 separate platforms and it's like 3 different apps. Android NEVER exports video correctly the first time. If you render the same video 10 times, you'll get 10 different file sizes which makes no sense considering the input is the same. Videos may play fully or just freeze up halfway through. Green screen is dodgy and lighting must be perfect as you can't adjust it. Not a replacement for a professional stop-motion program."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"5hours of work ended up as nothing thanks a lot"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good with the frames but sometimes I cant get the picture I want and sometimes when I'm recording audio for a character and then I record another voice for another character the first voice over plays over top of the second one. All and all though the rest of the times I've used the app it's been pretty good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"That's real good it gets me to fame on my YouTube channel"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Its good except I want the speed of taking a photo more faster so It can be more smoother"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"PELIT LU"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good studio but i wish i could use the items for free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is pretty good, the quality and efficiency is decent and the prices are very reasonable. One thing i would like to nitpick is the filter: Could we perhaps get the option to have the filter be different for certain pictures in a clip please?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Pretty good, some if the controls are hard to manage and if you buy the pro version on one devic its not on your other device which is a bit annoying but overall it helps alot."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great game, use it every day üòÜ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"verey amazing game I persnaly want to share my animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is such a good app! Use it all the time. Definitely reccomend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Great app but when there gets to be over 500 frames the video will get stuck in an endless loop of loading so you can't test watch without waiting five minutes for the video to load, very annoying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love thisüéÉ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I just installed this on a pixel phone after using the app on iOS for some time and the app is missing the button needed to take a photo. It's just blank. The tutorial handwriting pointing to it is there, but no button."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this so i could make videos out of pics I took with my Nikon but I tried to import the images and was expected to pay to do so."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work at all. On OnePlus 7 Pro with Android 10, the ""Tap here to add pictures"" icon does nothing. Refuses to access camera. Children very disappointed. Maybe works only on older phones?"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Apparently this is the most powerful movie app on the store, well I'm sad to know that no other app is powerful enough to have the simple luxury of JUST IMPORTING PICTURES INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Appsulutly the best app for stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"because of this app, I failed my science project. You have to pay for everything and you need to pay to be able to type text, even though it doesn't explicitly say it's costs money. To the developers of this app, all I can say is that I hope your happy with yourself that you made a student fail one of their projects in the name of capitalism."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Useless , dont download this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's very amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've used this app many times for projects in art class,it has saved me from having to paint because,woo am I bad at painting."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I think it is a great game if you like to make your toys move but the problem is that you like have to buy everything so if you don't like to buy stuff on a game I think this game is not for you. by the way all tho this game makes you bye stuff I think it is still a amazing game to play!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its TRASH. You have to pay to import pictures and it has filters you have to pay for. Its like EA you have to pay for everything."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"UghhhHHH I NEEDED TO WAIT TWO Times To Download This And The Result SUCKS"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I would put 0 because I think it is just restarted that you have to pay to import photos. I rather download a stop motion app that doesn't have voice over. I hate how you have to pay to import. I dislike this, because this is why nobody even downloads this stupid app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Hi your so good app duty can u upgrade it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Cant even import photos without paying smh"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time with this free app. What is the point of making the stop motion when we can't upload it anywhere!!!! Uploading is only available for Paid version, you should have stayed it somewhere to not waste our time editing!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I can't believe I have to purchase the stuff. But is okay Stop Motion Studio! I just have you 1 star"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is a good app but the reason why I give it one star is due to the fact that my saved project is saved as a zip file and I'm operating for a Android device how do I unlock it?"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Pokemon and bigfoot Transformers"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This is a mildly good app. It does its function and you can make your own Stopmotion animations. But there are many major flaws. The biggest one, however, is that you can't do ANYTHING other than the actual pictures. If you want audio, stickers, a title/credits, or even just filters, you have to pay an unreasonable amount, just so you can make videos for your own amusement.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It only lets you record not any of what it says dont get waste of time and it says you have to buy it it's a rip off"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This is a great app overall. It's super helpful for very basic stuff. I haven't tried the paid version though. I don't like the fact that over half the features are paid only. Other than that, however, this is a great app when combined with others like DU Recorder."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Great way ro make stop motion vids. I completed my English and French project easily. Very easy controls and simple."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is a 5 star of course! It has been rated well so it's worth downloading!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I had bought the additional editing effects, but one day I went back on the app and it says I didn't buy them. I was angry to see this because, I was still charged to my credit card. I want ethier my money back or the additional editing options back because this is illigal, this is robbery."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"My daughter has this and we've made really fun movies so Im getting it too."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I purchased the full featurrd version of your app. Is this the same as Stopmotion Pro? Can I transfer this to another phone when I get a new one? How do I truly keep this app forever?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best game ever!Only problem;You can't pit the green screen on without the whole screen being green,even with something infront of it.Other than that I would recommend this game to anyone that loves stop motion!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use! Perfect for all!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I HATE THIS APP"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"So i made 2 good stopmotions on here that let me play back to see my progress on them. But for some reason whenever i try to make a third one and play back to see my progress it wont. It's like it glitches the loading symobol and you cant get to see your progress unless you play the full movie. whenever I have a stop-motion with more than two thousand frames, I go back, play it again only for the frames to out of nowhere get choppy and crappy when looked smoother the first time I filmed pls fix."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app I highly recommend it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is so good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"For some reason the screen moves between frames... its ANNOYING I HATE it SO much"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app its fun and creative! It takes over your mind into a stop motion world!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It used to be great! But now the audio is always delayed and it skips, it also deletes stopmotion. The ones that dont delete it won't let me download to my phone or upload to youtube. What am I supposed to do with over 2000 pics that took hours of work? Plz fix this problem. If this problem was fixed this is a really great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Such a money eating app. Needs money to even adding a song. And doesn't provide the reference either. Bad."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The sound don't work"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"A bit buggy at times but other than that very good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I installed this app a month ago, BUT IT HAD CRAZY GLITCHES!!!! THE MORE I WORKED, THE WORSE THE GLITCHES!!!!! I'm thinking about installing this again cause I saw reviews and they said the glitches are gone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful if you're interested in making stop motions for YouTube. Some people complained at the cost to add sound and other things, but compared to other stop motion apps such as dragon frame (around $200 dollars) the cost is quite reasonable. Whilst it certainly isn't as good as dragon frame, it's much easier to use and has all the features you need to make a good stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It really stinks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"low quality ui and main features need money. just make this apk not free then üí©"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It works thank you so much for making this add"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its a paid app :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't Import photos from your device without making an in app purchase."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"So cool I definitely recommend it to ages 8 and 10"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for 5 years and i never failed me once if there was 10 stars I'd give them it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good for lego"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Easy to do, easy to put on youtube. I like it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app sucks it works in every way that your camera does and on your camera after you get done taking your picture/videos it doesn't require you to wait for 5 minutes just to watch it. Also the audio is trash and it doesn't allow you to add your own."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Animation Part Works OK! The rest of it is terrible. I made an animated movie only about 900 slides long, and it won't play! I contacted their customer service and asked if the problem was on the apps end or if it was my device's problem. They sent me an email telling me to restart my device. I had already tried this and it didn't work. They said they would contact me in five business days. It has been around two weeks now, and I have heard nothing! Sad, I loved this app, I made a few movies :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Such a simple task requires so much money. Completely useless app, do not waste your time."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Best stopmotion app that I've used. Has a lot of useful features for a reasonable price. I've used this app to make movies with sound effects and music in 4k. You can download this version but I'd suggest that you use the paid version because it could ask you to pay for it again if you have more than one profile on your phone."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's very good it's just can you add the eraser thing from the pro version it's a small thing so it probably won't be anything to big"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Best stop motion app ever! It may not have digital background, or drawing effects, but it is awesome. You can make your own effects"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Omg so much better than using a Nintendo 3ds I love that I can add audio, my problems aren't with the app itself its mainly myself"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I know a way to get pro :) for free!!!!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have always been into stop-motion, the transactions are small payments and the useful additions you get by paying make your stop-motions the best they can be! Even with the quality depending on lighting, (and me not having a friggin lamp) this app is still a very professional and fun app to use! 5/5!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its just awesome to watch and create! I love to look at my old work and compare to my new work! Should really download this app!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"My young boys and I have enjoyed this app quite a bit. Would give five stars but went to add music, was given a purchase upgrade screen (as expected). Noticed the ""buy all upgrades for a better deal"" link and clicked on that. Clicked one click purchase. Back to video, wanted to add music. Clicked ""Add music"" Another purchase screen! Even though I just bought all the upgrades."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"it was a good app, but there is 1 fatal flaw. the lighting won't work when its night or just really late in the day"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is very straightforward and simple to use. It has many options to edit various aspects of your video such as the ability to add audio and duplicate frames. One feature that comes extremely handy is being able to overlay a previous frame as you're shooting a new one which can minimize the amount of unintended displacement and choppiness. The app has features that require payment and they range from being a bit unnecessary to immensely useful additions. Overall, I heavily recommend this app."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"the app is awesome. but the thing is that you guys should decrease vip features and give some features for free. but it is good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's so nice and new app for stopmotion it's awesome that's why I am gaving 5 stars :-)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good but no so good for me"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"stupid apps.not free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"ever since the new update i can't play back my animation. other than that, the app brilliant"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This is honestly probably the best stop motion app. If you bought the pack like I did, it adds so many features on to it. There are still some VERY annoying problems with it too. For example, when I am trying to pause a photo, I have to move the slider very slowly or else it wont register. Also, I feel like the timeing is off alot. When I pause a scene, it sometimes doesn't pause. Very annoying most of the time but great.  UPDATE: App crashed and won't pause scenes. Audio is off and keeps going even after I stop it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"is app is bad editing app u need to pay to sdd one of YOUR PICTURES for me its judt a scam and it just wants your money i recommend using a different editing app thank u for reading my comment and i hope it helps"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use! There is the whole, buying passes for certain effects and options. Atleast those items are cheap."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"is it just me or am I the only one who the app didn't even download , because I download it, it reaches 100% then it just starts all over again and it's been doing that for the past 20-30 minutes, i restarted the app, nothing. i deleted all cache and data, nope nothing... can someone.please help???"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"oof"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"IF YOU MAKE A BAD REVIEW, YOU ARE WRONG!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Rubbish. Claims to be free, asks for money to activate the feature to import photos. Junk."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I've downloaded this before, it was fun. One day I needed more storage so I deleted it and later on I tried to install it and I pressed install multiple times and it just DIDN'T work! PLEASE FIX THIS I hate the price on stop motion pro"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app was AMAZING! It is very simple to use and the bundle that includes all the stuff is quite a bargain. But when you want to use the shapes when editing I wish you could rotate them, but other than that this app is awesome!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is a great app I use this app a lot there's only one flaw it is that if you have a YouTube channel and you want to upload your video you cannot do it I have no clue why won't let me upload my videos I reccomend downloading AZ screen recorder because it seems everything that's on your phone and you can use that to upload your video so if you want you can end saddened to it because it hears everything you say behind the phone so then you can add sound so like if you want to add sound you can"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"im trying to watch and upload my movie but its not working. oh nevermind i just needed to update"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"because it won't go into my gallery"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"wasted my time creating video and can't export the video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I cant restore the purchased. The restore purchased takes a very long time. I hope i can get the solution faster."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"They took things out of the app that I really liked. besides that the so is full proof.üòâ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"The app is nice, I've made all of my stopmotions on it. The problem is that you have to buy all the features. Another problem is when you make a movie that long, it gets all glitchy and makes it hard to add in sound effects. They just need to fix the bugs and not make it as expensive"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"does anyone wants to make a movie?! then this is the app!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I found this app really good as it's great for stop motion but the sounds don't work on your own device they only work by recording from another device and u have 2 pay 4 alot of stuff 3.5stars not 5"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i am not even able to save my project!!! i just bought it and it was working fine before that."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's fun but I am unable to restore my purchases. I just keep getting the wait I g spinning circle on the screen."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It look ok at frist but then it asked me to pay for me to use my laibary? Wow that's not ok...."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is worst.My must pay?I hate you guys.**** you all"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"mediocre experience done better by their competitors"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"why even my dowloaded music will need to buy for the background music of my project. I have been downloaded it. pls do something new"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You cant even export your videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app is so cool!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Got the app, payed for all premium features, downloaded the app on other device, in order to use remote/wifi camera feature... but it appears that I need to buy premium features once more, on the second device, even though I am on both devices logged in with the same google account. That was one very unpleasant surprise :/"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"stupid"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i like this app so much it give me the creativty of making motions"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"This app is good but i think it is too fast for me. I have mixed feelings about this app. Overall I don't think its very good I do not want people getting this app who don't like fast stopmotions. I'm not impressed:("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"no ads!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Pretty terrible experience as you cannot do anything without paying not even adding music or putting up a title screen. It ruined the lego race animation I was trying to make, if you are going to call an app free make it free! It is more like a trial or lite version than the real thing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good very"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Id like to have all features without paying money."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad compatability This app doesn't work well with the Oneplus 6t"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Once you have the pro version it's flawless, my only problem is that I don't seem to be able to download my movies after I've made the... any idea how you do it? Unfortunately I seem to have lost the pro version for no reason whatsoever.. please help."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I downloaded this app on my previous phone and paid for it to upgrade to pro version. I lost my phone somehow and now when i have downloaded it again on my new phone i have to pay for it again. Great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The description is misleading because it does not provide all of these features out of the box. For example, import images (the only reason I was looking for an app like this) is pro-only feature."

Now i am worried i have to redo all my hard work because of your app problems."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it is so dumb......."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"The creation part is okay as long as you're willing to spend money. However, in my experience the app crashes whenever I want to save my final product or even play it inside the app once saved."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"infinite app which can fulfill your movie or stop motion video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Get the paid version everyone(sadly), because the free version doesn't provide us with the even the basic of facilities like importing photos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"app is trash. it freezes and stops taking photos. it bounces around without me touching it. it takes photos when i dont want it to. and it doesnt take photos when i push the button. its confusing. you have to open seversl different things just to do one thing."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"I really liked the functionality and the simplicity of the app. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because as stated in previous reviews videos can't be exported unless you have an iPhone. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"After the update the videos said cannot played"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"The app is great you can take pictures to make stop motion and the pictures will not affect your storage space, my only problem is the export thing, its hard to export to youtube and you cant even export it anywhere even on your photos, please fix this, the app is good only the export is my problem.

I thought this would be fun for me and my daughter to do together, buuut... Straight out tha gate, you can take pictures to load into the project, but you can't upload any from a gallery.

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is overall pretty good! whenever I used it I was always somewhat satisfied. I think whenever I wasn't satisfied with the product it was because I got sloppy. However, I ended up getting a new phone (android s10e) and for some reason it wouldn't let me upload my work onto my YouTube channel, I'm not sure if this has happened to other people, but I'm just trying to give a heads up for those of you who have an android."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"baaaaad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"so I like this app but it's taking so long to load when I tried to upload it can someone tell me how to fix it I don't know if it's my internet"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"thank you so much!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"the very first time using it. im suuuper excited until when im done recording, when i realize that it only recorded less than half of vid. VERY dissapointing. 2 stars."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is the best i love it it works and i made a lot of stop motions transformes and stuff and i never get tired of it its just so much fun and i recommend this app you should try it out"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"the sound effects picture quality and all Features needs money to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I think it works really well doing stop motion"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"WHY IT IS LAGGING"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"hell of a greedy company, you have to pay for adding images!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It won't download on my device. HELP!!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I downloaded the app again because I wanted to show my friend my old videos. I expected to be able to login to have all of my videos. Come to find out that you can't log in. I see this as a major problem that needs to be fixed. Please get on this ASAP. Thanks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like the app so much but I really wish you didn't need to purchase stuff to make the app better plus I really aren't aloud to purchase anything so I really hope you read this and make stop motion studio pro free,thankyou"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"IT IS VERY GOOD I MEAN VERY GOOD"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"perfect for youtube chanles"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Pls how do i download all the effects"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Sucks!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"haven't down loaded it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"it's good except once you go back on it a day later it won't let you play your video and just glitches out. >=("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"at first the app works fine but when i want to wacth my stop motion it doesn't want to play plus i cannot put music in it and i can't even put my stop motion on youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing, simple, fun to use and the fact that its free is ü§Ø"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"o.k."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Why does the picture from the camera roll only for premiums and no voice recording allowed!!!???"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Yeyeyey"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i cant export the video, it gives me an error..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"It won't let me in the app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great I had a blast making my own stop motion animation."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Yes boi"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I made a"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"straight off the bat, GOD MODE!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"This is a pretty useful app for animating, but a major flaw would be difficulty with exporting the videos. Often when I try to export in video format, the video will be unwatchable (it won't play when you click on it), or it simply won't upload to my photos. Which is a shame, because other than that it would be a great app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it's great and I love it but how do you onion skin?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"but i dont like the rub that option is not open"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Basically if you want to do anything, starting as small as getting the images you want to use for your video from your own gallery, you have to pay."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is a cool app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"well it was cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it never let's me use the camera it says error with camera"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app, really got me into stop motion and claymation. One thing i would say is to be ablr to add motion blur to the stop motion to make it more genuine but other than that i <3 this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's great but I can't export videos. When I try to export it just says Stop Motion studio has stopped working..."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I installed and uninstalled after doing my first movie because the app kept asking me to pay for every audio, frame,and effect that I wanted to use üò° (even audio from my own library!üò°üò°üò°) So GUYS THIS IS NOT A FREE APP! The only thing you can do is shoot some frames and play it, no audio, no titles, no effects, no nothing! üëéüëéüëé"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Disappointed. Paid for the feature to add clips, but when i attempt to do so the app crashes."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"When i press play on my movie it stops every time pls fix this problem if you will i might give you 5 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it's crartof and fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Very good and helpful, but you have to buy too much I would give 5 stars if more was free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"You have to buy everything!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I bought somthing and it wont let me use it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"no features on free version but the main problem is it takes the photo a couple of months after you hit the button"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"have not got it but there's 5 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"so I wanted to make a movie and i loved Hao my toy hamsters moved in it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I worked so very hard for 3 weeks using up all my spare time trying to create a video and it wont even let me share it to youtube"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This is a super game to make YouTube videos with"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"yes. downloaded it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"so crappy that you have to pay for the video quality to go up. so greedy. you guys are pathetic."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is the best i staded to use this at school for a prochet"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"nice one for stop motion animation"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Hate how it costs money to add sound"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Amazing."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I've done it before it's amazing works really well had fun making my own vidioes would definitely recommend to anyone"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"this is the perfect app for stop-motion, but a recent update made it impossible to save videos properly. I will rate five stars if the save function was changed back to how it was before the update"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"good, but could be better. Needs to include ""onion skinning"" and it would be perfect. Also a link to a video on how its used would be great."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It takes time to get used to it, but once you do, you'll be animating like a boss!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"videos get compressed and come out pixelated, only discovered this after i bought premium version and am very upset"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"complicated to use, when i bought the draw feature i was unable to find where to use it. dislike the delay in the photo taking, might as well just use your own camera app and edit together manually."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good ig"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"simple, easy to use, haven't had any problems"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"NO üëéüëéüò° FREE NO"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"ugh it is too good it ruined stop motion for me now I cant use any other stop motion app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is terable I lost all my videos"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"this is awesome"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I would actually give it a 4.4 if there was an option to split one of the rating stars. very very nice app, everyone got a kick out of it. cool thing to do with your friends, and if you have a couple toys and a device, but are still bored, STOP MOTION is the very thing to do. I've had no problems with the app other than that the audio comes in late sometimes. I would definitely recommend this app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"rubish rubish rubish"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a great way to make stop motion animations,and it is super easy to use all though it is kind of hard to understand what is what."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Awesome very recomended 100% My only wish is that you dont make the title editing process cost money and make some things not need to be payed for other than that AMAZING"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Liked it, issue was that in the actual video it didnt show as much as it did in the editor."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"awesome."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this is great for stop motion"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"its nice and i use it but you cant really use any special effects unless you pay for every one individually"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Don t work properly need fix it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"not bad but needs more cool stuff maybe add effects and filters"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is terrible. I have to pay for everything!!! And, this is just me, but I have a problem with the fact that the person/company is called CatEaters regarding the fact that cats are my favorite animals. True sadness."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"to my Standard I'm really good for me because I like it how it like makes me be able to interact with other stuff so that I can make something like a movie and then advert and trailers."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Its great if you want to make a hard movie but very laggy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Im in love with this game"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i got this app because i thought i could add images then i tryed to but i cost money that i dont have"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good job on this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I think this is a grate app for people who love animation so think that is very very good and this is emoji how I feel about this appüòçüòçüòçüòôüòôüòôüòôüòòüòò‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫üòÄüòÄüòä"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"best app for stop motion, really easy to use and best of all, no ads, no lag, and completely free. i really recommend this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it so much! Way better than any other stop motion app! All though, it is really annoying when the app just flat out stops when I'm trying to go back to one of my videos."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool i can make cool Stop Motions! :)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is awesome. I've created over 50 movies."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Well, to me it's kind of weird that when I created an animation, it said that google wanted my real name and a picture of my real face. Which made me feel paranoid a little bit. In conclusion, I would not reccomend this app if you dont want your information to be exposed."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"please make the pro free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Truly a fantastic appüòÅ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"hated"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"everytime i go watch a new video of mine it says that the app has stopped and its really annoying"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"gd app for stop motion movies!sometimes it blurs if you move to quickly"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its great i think it could be cool if there a was burst shot option to rapidly take photos of something moving like a ball rolling.. it would be easier to burst shot this rather than take individual shots. overall great app which allows me to make great things!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"yes! this app was amazing but yes to some extent.It us paid after some time."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"great easy to use"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Amazing app! very smooth and has alot of options. frame rate can be chosen, (for you starters out there try 10-14 frames). It only has one downside, and thats the export problem. how come i cant export my animations to my gallery? im sick of trying to access my drive or something else just to view it. Please add an option to export videos into your gallery. i dont understand why the devs didnt put that in. please put that option in, and i would even pay for the full one. thanks Cateater!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Thi is cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Its not working fix your game or else I will make thos one star to zero star GET ON IT!"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is great but it has a problem. There should be an option to save one of your movies to you camera gallery. that would make it a bit more convenient for me"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this app is good,the thing that you need to fix is the time"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"wanted to try to clip together a bunch of photos but the app out of the box won't let me without purchasing anything. I wish they could've let users try a limited version of it for a certain period and then let them decide to purchase the features. :("
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Too many in app purchases"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it won't download it won't stop saying installing and by accident I flagged it so I'm sorry app creators but your app is really buggy"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i love this app it's so cool you can make like any videos you want and I'm even stopped at a do it again. do it again pictures of cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"good app but on a phone once you edit a picture it becomes small. I will restore purchases because it's a bit buggy on a phone (it's good on a tablet)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"soo cool and yeet"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"To be honest, I've been using this app since August of 2018, and it's been very helpful, the videos download quick and easy, and I definitely recommend this app for anybody that wants to get in to animation 4 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It is a very well working, easy to get around app but my only complaint is that you have to pay for some extra stuff."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"good app easy to use üòÄüòÄüòÄ"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"To difficult"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I got the app awhile back for my Grandson 8 and he's been making some movies with his LEGOs. He's getting pretty good so I got the package deal! Definitely worth it!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Cool app man"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"You can't make stopmotions with this. You have to pay for everything including editing and erasing your hands. It's like an extra camera app that takes up space. I wouldn't recommend this or the pro ap at all this is not a free app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i lick this"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"The best and easiest stop motion app out there!! üòÅ I would recommend it for anyone."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"the app doesnt have any bugs which is a start but i wish that the photos had more options like filters and things like that that you could add. overall i thinnk this app is good and i have made over 20 movies with it so its my go to movie maker. hope this review helps anyone with downloading the app cause its good but just needs more options. if you added those things than i would be really happy and the app would be my favorite app. hope it helps."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This. App. sucks. literally EVERYTHING requires you to pay for it. and it isn't worth it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"you have to pay the giod app you can,t even have sound."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"couldn't even take pictures in the app to start with"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"to fast"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I love this app but one disappoinment is that I could do so many more things and use more of my creativity with all the perks that aren't free."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Overall it was good. A few things I think were wrong were that you can't use the flash from your phone, and the drawing future is paid. You kind of need it for some projects, but would recommend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"that is an awesome app;)"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"Using this now and the camera feature doesn't work in samsung galaxy note 9. Hoping there would be a fix for it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Apparently adding pictures from your camera roll is a premium feature."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It IS a great app it WILL do what it's supposed to. And who ever says it isn't is brain damaged and dumb since it's so easy and fun to use. And that's my review."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"if you see this get it!!!! it is super good and I had the free version for over a year now and I have so pretty good movies! it take up a lot of my free time definitely recommend."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"this was really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"amazing i love this i definitly reccomend this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is really good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"won't work with my device"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"good to take a üé• but in the stray erase is not there"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's great for making videos and stop motion videos and stuff like that üëå :D"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"i dont know if this cool pls answer me is it coooooool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"This app is really easy and fun to use! Even though it takes a while, its worth it in the end to see your masterpiece! note: YOU FIXED ALL THE BUGS THANK _you!!!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"GREAT i use this so often infact i use it to make stop motions all the time using stick bots (i dont like the official stik bot app) action figs, clay, and lego and TONS more! so if you reading this I 15/10 this app!and if there was a ten star button id press that. thanks developers for making this app! and also if you buy pro( i did on my old phone but i use a new email on this one) yo get TONS of features and its a small fee for so much more Features. best stop motion movie app EVER!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's a good app.But may be improved."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is fun but it deletes at least 2 of your slides in the begining and at the end but it ia a good game for people just learning how to make stop motion vidoes"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Can't download this app, used to use it before, now seems like its useless."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"U have to spend a pound to erase wow I don't want to pay money for a lego animation for god Sake"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"please add eraser"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"lot time but gr8"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"usefull. Thanks to team"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it does not show up on the apps."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"The app function is good but use old photo and drawing etc also need to pay!üòûl am very disappointed !"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it is an amazing app it lets you add an over voice, sound effecs and filters."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Does this free app work? Took pictures, it seemed to capture them, but the playback is black. Help?"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"It is HARD to use the green screen. Still do not get it"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"so I think that you should make some of your features free because I have been trying to edit all my stop motion movies but I can't edit them"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"so much fun must get!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"super! 4 stars"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Great but why do I have to buy in order to add pictures from gallery?? I mean it makes no sense"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"great app, does everything you could want (so far, I'm still an amatuer) but it does what it says it does, and for a small ONE-TIME fee you get the all the tools. I cant wait to get dragon frame though so that I can do pics with my dslr camera. but for people just starting off this is the best way to learn the basics and advanced stuff too really. great job and thank you so much. I use this app every single day!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"it's a good app but you have to pay everything"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like it but it takes forever to load when you go out of the app and you try to see to see the video again"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I wish it were completely free"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I LOVED IT!!!! its awsome, i made so much in this app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Drawing and editing pictures don't work very well with my Android. Works great with Apple Phones though."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"it a good app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"love it all"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"This app is great for making stop motion. I loved seeing my creations come to life. So, why do I give 4 stars? It's because of the amount of features that needs to be payed for. I could understand the green screen and rotoscoping. But sound effects and painting are almost nessesities to stop motion, but that's just my opinion. In full short, if your looking for something just to get the job done this is for you. If you want special effects for free, you may need to consider a different app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Why can't save like video"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"I like that app. It's so easy to do fun mini videos or animations and my all friends say wowowowowo I want to do too that omggggg but I don't say app name XDDD"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I like this app because in the past it was such a big help for me 2019 here I come"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the app, but the sound delay is what has me tempered, it's fine at the beginning, but after a few frames, it begins to slow down, it slows down so much I have to move back the audio a few frames in order to time it correctly. Please fix this."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"wow so convenient"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Very good for lego animations"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"Good app ! Description Would't Fit, thanks"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"this would have been better if it had a green screen and more ways to export it. ive been trying to export it but it wont let me. this is getting really annoying. I need it in my drive"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Fantastic tool for stop motion. Easy to use with great features and reliable."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"i feel it would be extremely helpful, if the select all feature was applicable to the pauses. it feels tiresome if you shot a big sequence and have to keep adding pauses one by one to it."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"It's a good app but the stop motion studio pro app cost money so I use stop motion studio but soon I will be able to buy the stop motion studio pro app it helps me with my animation and it's a really good app I can edit in it"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"Fake"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its fun"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"i purchased this app. i just want to play my videos. the videos i recorded won't play outside of editing mode. and ""if"" they do play in editing mode. which the sometimes do. i then get to see the content. editing is a breaze. i guess. i mean i can't always view the content after editing. i am looking forward to a software update for this issue soon."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It's ok but it does act up some times.‚ò∫But it's still good for stop motion."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"good"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"It is really good except it wont let me have sound. But it has good frames.If there was 4.9,id rate it that.This is one of the few apps of stop motion that works."

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"stopmotion is the only good app that I .can make things move on it is so cool at the end cause you actulay get to see it realy move"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't seem to work on the one plus 6. I keep getting a blank screen when I start up a new project."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I downloaded it mostly for the ghost effect where you can see 50% of the previous frame. But this app shows me a zpomed in frame of my camera(yes, zoom is set to 1.0x) and as soon as pic is taken, it stores it as zoomed out. So in the ghost mode when I compare with previous frame, the previous frame is zoomed out which current camera view is zoomed in. Completely loses the point of that feature when the 2 images don't superimpose perfectly."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I have been using Stop Motion Studio for about 3 days and it is amazing what you can do with it! I am only using the free version for now but it works extremely well and I am considering buying the full. My only issue is that you have to refocus the camera a lot between each shot which can be easily forgotten when working with a lot of moving characters but other than that it's the best stop motion app I've used by far."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"Wow an amazing animating app with ease!"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"ok cool"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"really love this app its gr8 for school projects or just for fun in general. just wish i didnt have to pay to get background sounds but thats life"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",4,"You can make good videos with this app. This the best stop motion app on the playstyle compared to other in my opinion. it's just annoying how I needed to buy some of the features. But it's still really good."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"I've been waiting 20 minutes still hasn't installed"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",2,"the app only catches the last 3 frames when I do an animation longer than 10 frames"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"what an awesome app"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"its really cool."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app I have ever used. Not only is it a horrible app but their support is horrible. This app is so bad Im actually taking the time to write a review."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I love it stop motion studio # BEST THING EVER! üòâ"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"randomly shuts off and when you exit a video you hit a help button that sends you to a website and is very annoying."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Would be better if you could upload photos from your gallery. I don't necessarily want to take pictures with the app."
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a beginners stop motion app. It has options for you to add text, music, etc. The camera is easy to use and you can use focus too, so that's a bonus. I would recommend buying the premium version of the app, if you want to add more things to your anitmations, but, overall, great app with simple features. üëç"

"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",5,"how the hell the stop motion is here , probably best ones if it is best , truly amazing"
"Stop Motion Studio","Unknown",3,"Its good. But all it wants is for you to buy all the features. Like buying sounds etc. And it gets annoying at times because all you want to do is to make a reasonably good stop motion video without having to worry about buying anything. I hate apps that do this anyway. I didn't keep the app because of how annoying it was. If the creators can make it so that you don't have to pay for EVERYTHING, then I might consider getting it again..."
