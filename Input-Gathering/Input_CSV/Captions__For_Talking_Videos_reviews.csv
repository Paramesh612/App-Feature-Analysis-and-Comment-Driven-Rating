Not to mention, the video might not be perfect which I'll have to regenerate some lines again. So I have to wait a total of 12 to 24 hours just to complete a short video??

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",2,"Teribble, I have bought the subscription and cancelled it today. 2 stars are because it did generate an ai video but the accent is much british. Next after generating 8 videos of AI I had to wait 360 minutes for each video? I mean. Why? If the pressure is that high and server is low in capabilities to hold a big client queue then what's the point of subscription?"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"You are rude, I can't download the video until I pay, I can't see the video in HD resolution until I pay, etc.. and your packages are too expensive.

Now it's 9.99 a month USD which is ridiculous considering other caption apps are free. I was working on a video for 3 hours and it all got thrown away because of this, didn't know cuz it was free last time I made a video. They're killing video editing by paywalling it."

I have one suggestion , I cannot find undo button in this app . If u add that feature that would be wonderful üòÅ"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"What you need to know: the 9.99/ month plan with not upload any video that is longer than 5 min. After uploading a video that is less that 5 minutes, the program will not export it. If you choose to contact technical support then you will get the usual template answer. I just chose to loose the 9.99 and learn the lesson"

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",2,"This app has a lot of potential but it has shocking limitations. I have a small delivery/courier company. One of the items I deliver is alcohol and I'm licensed to deliver it. I could not create an ad for my new business because the website mentions alcohol. The app could have given me the option to remove that word and just talk about my generalized delivery services. It would not. Also, the app rewords what I've written. It leaves critical details out. Such as names, descriptions, businesses"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",2,"It seems like a good app but is not anything like caput.you are not able to watch other people's videos and it is confusing to use.kids are not able to understand unlike caput is very easy to use and also fun.i am sad because I cam not reinstall caput so I decided to try out this app it is not as great as capcut.i am pretty confused why I could not sign in with my Google account?

Such poor performance is unacceptable for any app. Developers should fix these issues immediately, or users will stop trusting their platform."""
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",5,"Very good, but have to ask this question. How many captions can I use for free as I only want to use that function. I got rid of Tik Tok with all its madness shutting down and reopening. Let me know thanks."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",2,"I was really excited about Captions.ai's promise of a free option after January 19th, especially with the news about CapCut's potential ban in the US. However, I was disappointed to find that the app still requires a GoPro subscription for Php589.00 per month. It seems like they misled people with their claims of a free option. This is a huge turn-off, especially considering the price. I wouldn't recommend this app. It's better to stick with CapCut, which is free."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",5,"Ok so ducking slay"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",5,"It a cool üòé app for editors like me I like the app very much guys, this is a great job you did here. üòäüòä"

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"Horr√≠vel, bug o video todo, fica parecendo que ta travando"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",3,"The app looks good, but it'd be nice to know if i could actually use it. I've given it permission to access my photos and all that, yet it doesn't seem to be getting my screenshots. I can't exactly edit anything if it doesn't let me get my screenshots. But so far, it's looking good and like something I can use.( UPDATE I decided to edit a video I have, but it's really glitchy and low quality."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",5,"Best ap"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"The video that was created was stellar, but you can't download the video without paying for the subscription. No beef there, but don't say it's a ""totally free"" app when it provides no usable value unless one pays"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"pure garbage doesn't even worth to try it"
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"First off when I go to downloaded videos on my phone I can't put those as I project and when I add a ""overlay"" it's just a picture I can't put a video as an overlay and it's was supposed to be easy but don't recommend"

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"Does not let you edit videos. I feel scammed. I wish all of these influencers won't say this new update will allow you to edit your videos. All it offers is AI editing or simple caption features. I didn't even see video editing in their 3 price tier pro versions"

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",2,"The app has great potential but at this point, the app it's not worth its price. The main issue for me was exporting the videos. Few videos worked on the 1st try. Other videos worked on the second or 3rd attempt. Other videos worked on the 1st attempt but didn't work after that. A couple worked after I deleted the project and started it all over again but many didn't. There is no especific pattern for this issue. very frustrating. The saving point was customer service who were quick to respond."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",3,"This is a really great app for editing! I love it, nice quality, almost everything is free, and it runs really smoothly! But the reason I gave this 3 stars is because it doesn't have the option to upload just a picture in to edit, nor does it have the option to add in multiple photos to edit into a video, if you see this I hope you can make that an option! It would be way better and more amazing! And there isn't a help center to guide you through the app, so I recommend that too! Great app tho!"

"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",4,"Has great edits with AI assistants. Would suggest reviewing the AI for dubbing the language as I noticed the speeking tends to change to different voices for each line of spoken audio and makes the dub feel inconsistent and could create confusion when the end user follows a conversation."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"not as good as capcut. also, wants money for the features people will want to use."
"Captions: For Talking Videos","Unknown",1,"Okay, so I've seen this on an ad on yt snd and says it is EXACTLY Like capcut just ""better."" I'm sorry, but no, it's nothing like capcut it's like any other editing app. No hate. I go to capcut and take inspiration from other creators or just scroll for fun, but this app... JUST THE NAME AT THIS POINT CAPTIONS! I understand you guys made this app to replace capcut when it's banned, but the only thing that makes capcut is that capcut it is a scrolling,easy to use,fun making edits."

Don't really write reviews, but $10/month is kinda crazy if your product stops doing the one job it's designed to do."
